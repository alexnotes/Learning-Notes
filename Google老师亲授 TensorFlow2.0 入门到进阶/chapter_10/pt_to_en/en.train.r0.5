we who are diplomats , we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states .
and i can tell you , our agenda is full .
there is trade , there is disarmament , there is cross-border relations .
`` we loosely call them `` '' groups . '' '' they may represent social , religious , political , economic , military realities . ''
and we struggle with how to deal with them .
let me show you a slide here which illustrates the character of conflicts since 1946 until today .
these are quite different , and they are outside the grasp of modern diplomacy .
and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries .
so in a way , it is everybody 's business .
another acknowledgment we 've seen during these years , recent years , is that very few of these domestic interstate , intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily .
and we have among states a reluctance in dealing with them .
plus , during the last decade , we 've been in the mode where dealing with groups was conceptually and politically dangerous .
after 9/11 , either you were with us or against us .
and groups are very often immediately label terrorists .
the west , as i would see it , comes out of that decade weakened , because we did n't understand the group .
now i 'm not naive .
you can not talk to everybody all the time .
let us turn to afghanistan .
the situation , to be honest , is very serious .
now again , the military is necessary , but the military is no problem-solver .
`` and he told me that , `` '' this can be won militarily , minister . ''
`` we just have to persevere . '' '' now four com isaf 's later , we hear a different message : `` '' this can not be won militarily . ''
we need military presence , but we need to move to politics .
we can only solve this through a political solution .
they need an inclusive process where the real fabric of this very complicated society can deal with their issues .
now everybody agrees .
but now , as we prepare to talk , we understand how little we know .
we did n't grasp what was going on .
my point is that you do n't have to be neutral to talk .
and you can always walk .
and the other side which you 're going to engage is the one with whom you profoundly disagree .
`` prime minister rabin said when he engaged the oslo process , `` '' you do n't make peace with your friends , you make peace with your enemies . '' '' it 's hard , but it is necessary . ''
let me go one step further .
there 's a revolution going on .
the arab spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter .
and who knows what it will be called in the end .
that 's not the point .
because we never talk to the people in these countries .
most governments followed the dictate of the authoritarian leaders to stay away from these different groups , because they were terrorists .
`` right now , the discussion goes , `` '' should we talk to the muslim brotherhood ? ''
should we talk to hamas ?
`` if we talk to them , we may legitimize them . '' '' i think that is wrong . ''
if you talk in the right way , you make it very clear that talking is not agreeing .
and how can we tell the muslim brotherhood , as we should , that they must respect minority rights , if we do n't accept majority rights ?
how can we escape [ having ] a double-standard , if we at the same time preach democracy and at the same time do n't want to deal with the groups that are representative ?
how will we ever be interlocutors ?
talking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion .
so if we refuse to talk to these new groups that are going to be dominating the news in years to come , we will further radicalization , i believe .
we will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel .
the paradox here is that the last decade probably was a lost decade for making progress on this .
and the reason is what happened in south africa : nelson mandela .
`` and i think the international community would have said , `` '' fair enough . ''
`` it 's their right to fight . '' '' now as you know , mandela did n't do that . ''
so he engaged a political process of dialogue , not as a strategy of the weak , but as a strategy of the strong .
and he engaged talking profoundly by settling some of the most tricky issues through a truth and reconciliation process where people came and talked .
now south african friends will know that was very painful .
dialogue is not easy — not between individuals , not between groups , not between governments — but it is very necessary .
and what is dialogue really about ?
when i enter into dialogue , i really hope that the other side would pick up my points of view , that i would impress upon them my opinions and my values .
we know from our personal experiences that it 's easy sometimes just to walk , and sometimes you may need to fight .
but that strategy seldom takes you very far .
we are seeing some new signs .
we could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently , by engaging with civil society .
all of a sudden , ngos were not only standing in the streets , crying their slogans , but they were taking [ them ] into the negotiations , partly because they represented the victims of these weapons .
and they brought their knowledge .
and there was an interaction between diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up .
this is perhaps a first element of a change .
in the future , i believe , we should draw examples from these different illustrations , not to have diplomacy which is disconnected from people and civil society .
and we have to go also beyond traditional diplomacy to the survival issue of our times , climate change .
it 's crucial to understand , i believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom-up .
we as diplomats need to know the social capital of communities .
what is the legitimacy of diplomacy , of the the solution we devise as diplomats if they can not be reflected and understood by also these broader forces of societies that we now very loosely call groups ?
we have never had as many means of communication , means of being connected , means of reaching out , means of including .
our modern western societies are more complex than before , in this time of migration .
`` how are we going to settle and build a bigger `` '' we '' '' to deal with our issues if we do n't improve our skills of communication ? ''
thank you for your attention .
one of my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world , and i do that quite regularly .
they want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful , to be healthy , and to have a successful life .
my first trip in india , i was in a person 's home where they had dirt floors , no running water , no electricity , and that 's really what i see all over the world .
so in short , i 'm startled by all the things that they do n't have .
`` and so when i come back from these trips , and i 'm thinking about development , and i 'm flying home and i 'm thinking , `` we 're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations , '' you know , coke 's success kind of stops and makes you wonder : how is it that they can get coke to these far-flung places ? ''
and i 'm not the first person to ask this question .
but i think , as a community , we still have a lot to learn .
it 's staggering , if you think about coca-cola .
they sell 1.5 billion servings every single day .
so why does this matter ?
well , if we 're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we 're set as a world , we need to learn from the innovators , and those innovators come from every single sector .
so that 's why i took a bit of time to study coke .
they tap into local entrepreneurial talent , and they do incredible marketing .
so let 's start with the data .
they learn something , they put it back into the product , they put it back into the market .
`` they have a whole team called `` '' knowledge and insight . '' '' it 's a lot like other consumer companies . ''
so if sales start to drop , then the person can identify the problem and address the issue .
i had somebody from an ngo once describe it to me as bowling in the dark .
and so they took a bit of time to learn about that .
they set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers , and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people , who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product .
there are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in africa .
what is it that governments and ngos can learn from coke ?
i think a great example of this is ethiopia 's new health extension program .
they decided that was n't good enough , so they went to india and studied the indian state of kerala that also had a system like this , and they adapted it for ethiopia .
they trained 35,000 health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people .
in just five years , their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people .
now , think about how this can change people 's lives .
health extension workers can help with so many things , whether it 's family planning , prenatal care , immunizations for the children , or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery .
that is having real impact in a country like ethiopia , and it 's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008 .
in ethiopia , there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program .
`` they 're starting to talk about , `` '' how do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas ? ''
`` how do you incent them based on the impact that they 're getting out in those remote villages ? '' '' that 's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people 's potential . ''
now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow .
well , it 's aspirational .
so even though it 's a global company , they take a very local approach .
`` coke 's global campaign slogan is `` '' open happiness . '' '' but they localize it . ''
now , that played itself out in the world cup campaign .
`` let 's listen to this song that coke created for it , `` '' wavin ' flag '' '' by a somali hip hop artist . ''
( video ) k'naan : ♫ oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫ ♫ oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫ ♫ oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫ ♫ oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫ ♫give you freedom , give you fire♫ ♫ give you reason , take you higher ♫ ♫ see the champions take the field now ♫ ♫ you define us , make us feel proud ♫ ♫ in the streets our heads are lifted ♫ ♫ as we lose our inhibition ♫ ♫ celebration , it 's around us ♫ ♫ every nation , all around us ♫
melinda french gates : it feels pretty good , right ?
well , it 's based on avoidance , not aspirations .
i 'm sure you 've heard some of these messages .
`` `` wash you hands , you might not get diarrhea . '' ''
and i think that 's a mistake .
one example is sanitation .
we know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation .
people reuse it for a slab for their home .
they sometimes store grain in it .
i 've even seen it used for a chicken coop .
well , you work with the community .
you start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that should n't be done in the village , and they agree to that .
but more importantly , it saves lives .
can you you believe that ?
we know that circumcision reduces hiv infection by 60 percent in men .
so if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development , we can change communities and we can change whole nations .
well , why is all of this so important ?
so let 's talk about what happens when this all comes together , when you tie the three things together .
we 've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years .
so if you look back to 1988 , there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year .
in 2009 , we 're down to 1,600 cases .
well how did that happen ?
they have two and a half million vaccinators .
by august 30th , a genetic test was done , and we knew what strain of polio shriram had .
now it could have come from one of two places .
it could have come from nepal , just to the north , across the border , or from jharkhand , a state just to the south .
so what 's the endgame ?
well on september 4th , there was a huge mop-up campaign , which is what you do in polio .
they went out and where shriram lives , they vaccinated two million people .
so in less than a month , we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program .
and i 'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio .
now one of the challenges in polio , still , is marketing , but it might not be what you think .
and if we could do that , we could stop vaccinating everybody , worldwide , in all of our countries for polio .
so if coke 's marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness , i 'd say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms .
thank you .
so this is general relativity , this is quantum theory .
so in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization .
that is , natural selection works on properties , like fitness , which are about relationships of some species to some other species .
so exploration can pay for itself .
it 's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe .
( applause )
though it was based on very little evidence , many scientists thought that all mammalian brains , including the human brain , were made in the same way , with a number of neurons that was always proportional to the size of the brain .
now , if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain , then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities .
and yet , one is a chimp , and the other is a cow .
now maybe cows have a really rich internal mental life and are so smart that they choose not to let us realize it , but we eat them .
i think most people will agree that chimps are capable of much more complex , elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are .
`` so this is a first indication that the `` '' all brains are made the same way '' '' scenario is not quite right . ''
but let 's play along .
so the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able .
it seems quite vexing .
so that would give us extra cortex to do more interesting things than just operating the body .
that 's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body .
so the main reason for saying that our brain is larger than it should be actually comes from comparing ourselves to great apes .
the human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses .
and this is where the story started to bother me .
maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way .
maybe two brains of a similar size can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons .
maybe a very large brain does not necessarily have more neurons than a more modest-sized brain .
maybe the human brain actually has the most neurons of any brain , regardless of its size , especially in the cerebral cortex .
now , you may have heard or read somewhere that we have 100 billion neurons , so 10 years ago , i asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from .
i 've been digging through the literature for the original reference for that number , and i could never find it .
it seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain , or in any other brain for that matter .
so i came up with my own way to count cells in the brain , and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup .
it works like this : you take a brain , or parts of that brain , and you dissolve it in detergent , which destroys the cell membranes but keeps the cell nuclei intact , so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei that looks like this , like a clear soup .
it 's simple , it 's straightforward , and it 's really fast .
so we 've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far , and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way .
take rodents and primates , for instance : in larger rodent brains , the average size of the neuron increases , so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons .
but primate brains gain neurons without the average neuron becoming any larger , which is a very economical way to add neurons to your brain .
well , what about our brain then ?
we found that we have , on average , 86 billion neurons , 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex , and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning , and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex has , i think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
but just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean .
so , a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons would weigh 36 kilos .
that 's not possible .
so this brings us to a very important conclusion already , which is that we are not rodents .
compared to a rat , we might seem special , yes , but that 's not a fair comparison to make , given that we know that we are not rodents .
and all of you are primates .
and so was darwin .
his brain , like ours , was made in the image of other primate brains .
it is just a large primate brain .
i think that 's a very humbling and sobering thought that should remind us of our place in nature .
so the reason why the human brain costs so much energy is simply because it has a huge number of neurons , and because we are primates with many more neurons for a given body size than any other animal , the relative cost of our brain is large , but just because we 're primates , not because we 're special .
when we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain , i figured , maybe there 's a simple reason .
so we did the math .
we calculated on the one hand how much energy a primate gets per day from eating raw foods , and on the other hand , how much energy a body of a certain size costs and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs , and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day .
so it 's either a large body or a large number of neurons .
nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate .
what about us ?
with our 86 billion neurons and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass , we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding , which is just not feasible .
if we ate like a primate , we should not be here .
and remarkably , that matches exactly what our ancestors are believed to have invented one and a half million years ago , when they invented cooking .
to cook is to use fire to pre-digest foods outside of your body .
cooked foods are softer , so they 're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth , so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut , which makes them yield much more energy in much less time .
with this large brain now affordable by cooking , we went rapidly from raw foods to culture , agriculture , civilization , grocery stores , electricity , refrigerators , all of those things that nowadays allow us to get all the energy we need for the whole day in a single sitting at your favorite fast food joint .
so what once was a solution now became the problem , and ironically , we look for the solution in raw food .
my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex , and i think that 's the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
and what is it that we do that no other animal does , and which i believe was fundamental to allow us to reach that large , largest number of neurons in the cortex ?
no other animal cooks its food . only humans do .
and i think that 's how we got to become human .
studying the human brain changed the way i think about food .
i now look at my kitchen , and i bow to it , and i thank my ancestors for coming up with the invention that probably made us humans .
( applause )
it uses electromagnetic fields to isolate the atoms from the noise of the environment .
it 's no longer a solid , a liquid or a gas .
i have a ph.d in molecular biology .
but do n't take my word for it .
i think that bad powerpoint presentations are a serious threat to the global economy .
of course , that 's just the time we 're losing sitting through presentations .
one certainly ca n't argue with those numbers .
and there 's also many more male idiots in the world .
and that 's what i 'm now contributing to this .
we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes .
the sun burns our peripheral vision .
i 'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself , because space can wobble like a drum .
now we 'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe — a sonic composition .
so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song , which i 'd like to play for you — some of our predictions for what that song will be like .
now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
we can see them indirectly , because black holes wreak havoc on their environment .
they churn up debris in their surroundings .
but they wo n't come to us directly through light .
einstein also realized — and this is the real meat of the matter — that if you put energy or mass in the universe , it would curve space , and a freely falling object would pass by , let 's say , the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space .
what einstein did not realize was that , if you took our sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers — so you took a million times the mass of the earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across , you would make a black hole , an object so dense that if light veered too close , it would never escape — a dark shadow against the universe .
it was n't einstein who realized this , it was karl schwarzschild who was a german jew in world war i — joined the german army already an accomplished scientist , working on the russian front .
and he was reading einstein 's recently published general theory of relativity , and he was thrilled by this theory .
and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary : curves so strong that space would rain down into them , space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole .
and even light could not escape this current .
`` now he wrote to einstein , and he said , `` '' as you will see , the war has been kind to me enough . ''
this is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
he did not believe they existed in nature .
it 's actually not massive enough .
but if we did a little thought experiment — as einstein was very fond of doing — we could imagine putting the sun crushed down to six kilometers , and putting a tiny little earth around it in orbit , maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun .
and it would be self-illuminated , because now the sun 's gone , we have no other source of light — so let 's make our little earth self-illuminated .
it might spill off into the hudson a little bit before it destroyed the earth .
but basically that 's what we 're talking about .
there 's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe , but you actually have to get very close to fall in .
but what 's very impressive is that , from our vantage point , we can always see the earth .
the light from the earth , some of it falls in , but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us .
they can see you .
now , our sun will not collapse to a black hole — it 's not massive enough — but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy .
and if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light lensed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we could n't , anymore than light can escape .
and even though , due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation , our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time , it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us , right before we were crushed to death by the black hole .
it would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel , but it 's a total death experience .
they can be spinning hundreds of times a second .
at the end of their lives , they 're going around each other very near the speed of light .
space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .
it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem .
this was one of the groups .
it shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves .
they 're literally the sounds of space ringing , and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning , quiet black hole at the end of the day .
this is from my group — a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole .
the sound you 're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
we know that , as it falls in , it gets faster and it gets louder .
at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
it 's sort of like ding , ding , ding .
this is another sound from my group .
no , i 'm not showing you any images , because black holes do n't leave behind helpful trails of ink , and space is not painted , showing you the curves .
both black holes are moving .
and then they 're going to merge .
( thumping ) now it 's gone .
now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging — that it chirps up at the end .
now that 's our prediction for what we 'll see .
and surely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged .
and surely , the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years , or a million years , at the speed of light to get to us .
but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
it 's a remarkably ambitious experiment , and it 's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years — to pick this up .
there 's also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called lisa .
and lisa will be able to see super-massive black holes — black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the sun .
in this hubble image , we see two galaxies .
and each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core .
it might make a sound .
it 's everywhere , it 's all around you , and the space is wobbling chaotically .
fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us .
imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
that song has been ringing through space for all that time .
it gets closer and closer — 40,000 years ago , we 're still doing cave paintings .
( static ) it 's a terrible sound .
it 's literally the definition of noise .
but it 's around us everywhere , presumably , if it has n't been wiped out by some other process in the universe .
i mean , in the spirit of rising to ted 's challenge to reignite wonder , we can ask questions , at least for this last minute , that honestly might evade us forever .
or , is it possible that we 're just a branch off of a multiverse — each branch with its own big bang in its past — maybe some of them with black holes playing drums , maybe some without — maybe some with sentient life , and maybe some without — not in our past , not in our future , but somehow fundamentally connected to us ?
and if they are , i can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there .
thank you . thank you .
you ask her where she lives — where does she live in exile ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) i had a plan , and i never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo .
i knew i had to take a banjo with me to china .
and i was sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me .
and a record executive walked up to me and invited me to nashville , tennessee to make a record .
in fact , i went to nashville .
and after a few months i was writing songs .
and the first song i wrote was in english , and the second one was in chinese .
( music ) [ chinese ] outside your door the world is waiting .
inside your heart a voice is calling .
go get it , girl .
( applause ) it 's really been eight years since that fated night in kentucky .
to connect cultures .
i see it when i stand on a stage in a bluegrass festival in east virginia and i look out at the sea of lawn chairs and i bust out into a song in chinese .
[ chinese ] and everybody 's eyes just pop wide open like it 's going to fall out of their heads .
`` and they 're like , `` '' what 's that girl doing ? '' '' and then they come up to me after the show and they all have a story . ''
`` they all come up and they 're like , `` '' you know , my aunt 's sister 's babysitter 's dog 's chicken went to china and adopted a girl . '' '' and i tell you what , it like everybody 's got a story . ''
it 's just incredible .
and then i go to china and i stand on a stage at a university and i bust out into a song in chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight at this girl with the hair and the instrument , and she 's singing their music .
she started singing her song .
thank you .
they have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory .
and these are used with traces of blood visible .
so , it 's a normal-looking syringe .
every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury .
ladies and gentlemen , and more importantly , mo bros and mo sistas — ( laughter ) — for the next 17 minutes , i 'm going to share with you my movember journey , and how , through that journey , we 've redefined charity , we 're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world , and i hope , through that process , that i inspire you to create something significant in your life , something significant that will go on and make this world a better place .
so the most common question i get asked , and i 'm going to answer it now so i do n't have to do it over drinks tonight , is how did this come about ?
pretty much in every case , that 's how a charity starts .
i was with my brother and a mate having a few beers , and i was watching the world go by , had a few more beers , and the conversation turned to '70s fashion — ( laughter ) — and how everything manages to come back into style .
`` and a few more beers , i said , `` '' there has to be some stuff that has n't come back . '' '' ( laughter ) then one more beer and it was , whatever happened to the mustache ? ''
my girlfriend at the time , who 's no longer my girlfriend — ( laughter ) — hated it .
`` and we had a lot of fun , and in 2004 , i said to the guys , `` '' that was so much fun . we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year . '' '' ( laughter ) so we started thinking about that , and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer . ''
and i started to research that topic , and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it .
`` i said to him , `` '' i 've got the most amazing idea that 's going to transform your organization . '' '' ( laughter ) and i did n't want to share with him the idea over the phone , so i convinced him to meet with me for coffee in melbourne in 2004 . ''
and we sat down , and i shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across australia , raising awareness for this cause , and funds for his organization . and i needed a partnership to legitimately do that .
`` we ca n't have anything to do with you . '' '' ( laughter ) so i paid for coffee that day — ( laughter ) — and his parting comment as we shook hands was , `` '' listen , if you happen to raise any money out of this , we 'll gladly take it . '' '' ( laughter ) so my lesson that year was persistence . ''
every day — this morning , i wake up and go , my life is about a mustache . ( laughter ) essentially , i 'm a mustache farmer . ( laughter ) and my season is november . ( applause ) ( applause ) so in 2005 , the campaign got more momentum , was more successful in australia and then new zealand , and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point .
it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought , we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that i could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level .
it 's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches . ( laughter ) let me tell you that there 's not too many people interested in investing in that , not even the prostate cancer foundation , who we 'd raised about 1.2 million dollars for at that stage .
and leading into movember 2006 , we 'd run through all the money from foster 's , we 'd run through all the money i had , and essentially we had no money left , and we 'd convinced all our suppliers — creative agencies , web development agencies , hosting companies , whatnot — to delay their billing until december .
so we 'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars worth of debt . so if movember 2006 did n't happen , the four founders , well , we would 've been broke , we would 've been homeless , sitting on the street with mustaches . ( laughter ) but we thought , you know what , if that 's the worst thing that happens , so what ?
we 're going to have a lot of fun doing it , and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks .
then in early 2007 , a really interesting thing happened .
`` so i cold-called the ceo of prostate cancer canada , and i said to him , `` '' i have this most amazing concept . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' it 's going to transform your organization . i do n't want to tell you about it now , but will you meet with me if i fly all the way to toronto ? '' '' so i flew here , met down on front street east , and we sat in the boardroom , and i said , `` '' right , here 's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across canada raising awareness and funds for your organization . '' '' and he looked at me and laughed and said , `` '' adam , sounds like a really novel idea , but we 're ''
`` but he said , `` '' we will partner with you , but we 're not going to invest in it . you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work . '' '' so what we did was , we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country , the u.s , and the u.k. , and we did that because we knew , if this was successful , we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in australia . and that money fuels research , and that research will get us to a cure . ''
it was n't as successful as we thought it would be .
we were sort of very gung ho with our success in australia and new zealand at that stage .
last year we had 450,000 mo bros spread across the world and together we raised 77 million dollars .
and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches . ( laughter ) and for us , we have redefined charity .
we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people .
`` and i say to them , `` '' last year we were fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors . '' '' and they go , `` '' what , what do you mean ? '' '' and it 's like , everything single person , every single mo bro and mo sista that participates in movember is our celebrity ambassador , and that is so , so important and fundamental to our success . ''
`` and he goes , `` '' listen , i know it 's about men 's health , i know it 's about prostate cancer , but this is for breast cancer . '' '' and i said , `` '' okay , that 's interesting . '' '' and he goes , `` '' last year , my mom passed away from breast cancer in sri lanka , because we could n't afford proper treatment for her , '' '' and he said , `` '' this mustache is my tribute to my mom . '' '' and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi , and i did n't tell him who i was , because i did n't think it was appropriate , and i just shook his hand and i said , `` '' thank you so much . ''
`` your mom would be so proud . '' '' and from that moment i realized that movember is so much more than a mustache , having a joke . ''
`` of 26 , for the first time ever , i had a conversation with my dad one on one about men 's health . i had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer , and i learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and i was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease , and he did n't know that , and he had n't been getting screened for it . '' '' so now , that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer . ''
now to the funds we raise , and research , and how we 're redefining research .
we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world , and when we looked at this more recently , we realized there 's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions , let alone nationally , let alone globally , and this is not unique to prostate cancer . this is cancer research the world over .
and so we said , right , we 'd redefined charity . we need to redefine the way these guys operate . how do we do that ?
so what we did was , we created a global action plan , and we 're taking 10 percent of what 's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund , and we 've got the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world that look after that fund , and they come together each year and identify the number one priority , and that , last year , was getting a better screening test .
so they identified that as a priority , and then they 've got and recruited now 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic , essentially the same topic .
so now we 're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together , and that 's a unique thing in the cancer world , and we know , through that collaboration , it will accelerate outcomes .
and that 's how we 're redefining the research world .
and that city can go on and inspire a state , and that state can go on and inspire a nation , and beyond that , you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men 's health .
my name is adam garone , and that 's my story .
thank you , thank you .
i see anxiety .
we are always trying to decode our world .
it 's an eternal quest .
okay , good .
so gwen , i 'm going to hand you this envelope .
let 's take a closer look .
the plot thickens .
thank you .
mapendo , in swahili , means great love .
the husband , furious , threatens to kill the american .
what was the most difficult job you ever did ?
was it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property ?
my childhood was abound with questions like this .
we hid behind cars , running through the darkness that lay between the streetlights , boundless laughter ubiquitous across the pavement .
you ca n't run around in the dark .
but what does it do to a child to grow up knowing that you can not simply be a child ?
`` `` you ca n't sue someone for calling them a cunt . '' ''
`` `` '' i wish ashley judd would die a horrible death . ''
and i have responded to this with various strategies .
i 've tried engaging people .
that allowed me to take a stand for myself .
`` being told i 'm a `` '' snitch '' '' is really fun . ''
it 's clearly traumatizing .
our ability to go to school is impaired .
our girls .
i was able to start the speech project with colleagues .
has n't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ...
shall we talk about our friends in tech ?
we care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there to women over there ...
so apparently , i 've got a pretty bold voice .
so , let 's talk about our friends ...
you can do something , or you can do nothing .
72 percent of us have witnessed it .
aj : i 'm really cute .
aj : god does good work .
bless you .
and then we went to teachers .
so our work was n't affected .
and then we went down one more step .
90 percent of the funding came from thailand .
access to credit must be a human right .
see , starbucks you awake , we keep you awake and alive .
and then now , finally in education , we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it 's a lifelong learning center for everyone .
( applause )
so i 've said a number of times that we grow materials .
and it 's kind of hard to picture how that happens .
normally it 's at the back .
but that 's what happened all over eastern europe .
the camera is actually tracking all your gestures .
inspired by nature — that 's the theme here .
and i ended up in a town called frackville .
and it looks like a bombed-out landscape , but it is n't .
and here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up , but somehow were not connecting with them .
and so they 're holding off until they get a deal with them .
it 's breathtaking , in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming .
this is the coal supply for the steel factory — 18 square kilometers .
this was one of the biggest factories i 've ever seen .
we 've been laying out our dead for all of human history ; it 's call exposure burial .
it means accepting that we are doomed to decay and die , just like any other creature on earth .
so let 's return to the idea of protection , sanitation and beautification .
now , if this system of beautification , sanitation , protection does n't appeal to you , you are not alone .
so where do we go from here ?
so that 's one option for the future of cremation .
families can come here ; they can luxuriate in nature ; they can even plant a tree or a shrub , though only native plants to the area are allowed .
there 's hope in conservation cemeteries .
they offer dedicated green space in both urban and rural areas .
the soil , let me tell you , has missed us .
will changing the way we bury our dead solve climate change ?
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
i see cats and dogs walking towards me .
but she was frightened . she 'd lived 95 years and she 'd never had a hallucination before .
well , so i did tell the nurses .
his vision was pretty poor .
you know , i was wondering about freudian determinants .
you interact with them .
ca : and they do n't disturb you ?
ca : that was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
audience : shake . fold .
fold .
it was the coldest i 've ever been .
`` now , when it comes to pain , psychologist brock bastian probably said it best when he wrote , `` '' pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness . ''
i would love to give you a little perspective on what a day in my life can look like .
and once we got there , the vehicles were just as creative : snowmobiles , six-wheel soviet troop carriers , and a couple of super-sketchy helicopter flights .
but to me , that trip was a testament to the wildness i traded for those touristy beaches .
so this is the place where some of the largest , the most violent storms in the world send huge waves smashing into the coastline .
and then the temperature began to drop .
anything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer just a little bit , and that tiny bit of suffering that i did for my photography , it added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me than just trying to fill the pages of magazines .
and whatever number you 're thinking of , it probably is n't as bad as this .
it could have been amadou diallo .
you see , we were all outside when the contamination came down .
they are dynamic comedians .
and you do n't have sex .
while scientists regularly publish their latest research , we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets .
and about three years ago , i started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic — tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster .
could we bring down the lights please ? thank you .
and i 'm going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life .
( applause ) ( music ) terribly sorry . i forgot the floor .
hey .
come on .
( music ) please . ( music )
come on .
okay .
( music ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) ( music ) uh oh . ( music )
all right . let 's try this .
come on .
it should imagine a user .
`` and he said , `` '' no , never , john , never . ''
i could afford that .
so this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice , and yet it can do things that you and i could n't possibly entertain the idea of doing .
so the question is , where do we start this story ?
unless you 're prepared to get dung under your fingernails and root through the dung itself , you 'll never see 90 percent of the dung beetle species , because they go directly into the dung , straight down below it , and then they shuttle back and forth between the dung at the soil surface and a nest they make underground .
so the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
so this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball .
and then he 's about to become a victim of a vicious smash-and-grab . ( laughter ) and this is a clear indication that this is a valuable resource .
so what you 've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the african veld .
it 's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction , and at the same time it 's got to deal with the heat .
so what i want to share with you now are some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues have used to investigate how dung beetles deal with these problems .
so watch this beetle , and there 's two things that i would like you to be aware of .
a little dance , and then heads off in a particular direction .
so this animal has actually had the whole world turned under its feet . it 's turned by 90 degrees .
so our next question then was , how are they doing this ?
what are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement ? and the most obvious one is to look at the sky , and so we thought , now what could they be looking at in the sky ?
and the obvious thing to look at is the sun .
what we 're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position .
what happens now ? so clearly they 're looking at the sun .
the thing is the sun is not always available to you , because at sunset it disappears below the horizon .
what is happening in the sky here is that there 's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky that you and i ca n't see . it 's the way our eyes are built .
but the sun is at the horizon over here and we know that when the sun is at the horizon , say it 's over on this side , there is a north-south , a huge pathway across the sky of polarized light that we ca n't see that the beetles can see .
so how do we test that ? well , that 's easy .
the beetle comes out from underneath the filter and it does a right-hand turn , because it comes back under the sky that it was originally orientated to and then reorientates itself back to the direction it was originally going in .
so obviously beetles can see polarized light .
but how do they pick up those celestial cues ?
so what are they doing when they do this dance ?
how far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves ?
and see what his response is .
now we thought , now what could be going on here ?
and we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior .
one was hot , one was cold .
and then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera .
so what you 're looking at here is a heat image of the system , and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball .
so the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade .
it 's about the same as yours and mine .
and what 's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool .
but if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment , look at the temperature of the soil .
it 's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade .
and look at its front legs . they 're roaringly hot .
so the ball leaves a little thermal shadow , and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face , and all the time it 's trying to cool itself down , we think , and avoid the hot sand that it 's walking across .
so we described these as cool boots .
it was a dental compound that we used to make these boots .
`` so this is called stilting . it 's a thermal behavior that you and i do if we cross the beach , we jump onto a towel , somebody has this towel — `` '' sorry , i 've jumped onto your towel . '' '' — and then you scuttle across onto somebody else 's towel , and that way you do n't burn your feet . ''
and that 's exactly what the beetles are doing here .
however , there 's one more story i 'd like to share with you , and that 's this particular species .
it 's from a genus called pachysoma .
there are 13 species in the genus , and they have a particular behavior that i think you will find interesting .
can you spot the difference ?
they do n't normally go this slowly . it 's in slow motion .
this is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior .
and he does n't like this first position , but he comes up with a second position , and about 50 minutes later , that nest is finished , and he heads off to forage and provision at a pile of dry dung pellets .
and by and large , you 'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path .
and watch , you 're going to see another south african crime taking place right now . ( laughter ) and his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets .
now there 's two ways it could be doing that , and we can test that by displacing the beetle to a new position when it 's at the foraging site .
if it 's using landmarks , it will find its home .
if it is using something called path integration , it will not find its home . it will arrive at the wrong spot , and what it 's doing here if it 's using path integration is it 's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction .
it knows the bearing home , and it knows it should be in that direction .
if you displace it , it ends up in the wrong place .
so let 's see what happens when we put this beetle to the test with a similar experiment .
so here 's our cunning experimenter .
the forage has been displaced to a new position .
if he 's using path integration , then it should end up in the wrong spot over here .
so let 's watch what happens when we put the beetle through the whole test .
so there he is there .
shame .
it has n't a clue .
so what have we learned from these animals with a brain that 's the size of a grain of rice ?
we know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior and it 's also a thermoregulation behavior , and we also know that they use a path integration system for finding their way home .
this polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth surrounded by sectors of poverty and the socioeconomic inequalities they have engendered is really at the center of today 's urban crisis .
and while these two cities have the same population , san diego has grown six times larger than tijuana in the last decades , immediately thrusting us to confront the tensions and conflicts between sprawl and density , which are at the center of today 's discussion about environmental sustainability .
so i 've been arguing in the last years that , in fact , the slums of tijuana can teach a lot to the sprawls of san diego when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability , that we should pay attention and learn from the many migrant communities on both sides of this border wall so that we can translate their informal processes of urbanization .
what do i mean by the informal in this case ?
i 'm really just talking about the compendium of social practices of adaptation that enable many of these migrant communities to transgress imposed political and economic recipes of urbanization .
i 'm referring to the recycling of these old post-war bungalows that mexican contractors bring to the border as american developers are disposing of them in the process of building a more inflated version of suburbia in the last decades .
so these are houses waiting to cross the border .
but not only houses , also small debris from one city , from san diego , to tijuana .
i do n't want to romanticize poverty .
i just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness , that informality here , the informal , is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists , that this is about a bottom-up urbanization that performs .
see here , buildings are not important just for their looks , but , in fact , they are important for what they can do .
they truly perform as they transform through time and as communities negotiate the spaces and boundaries and resources .
and i 'm talking about how this begins to suggest that the future of southern california depends on the retrofitting of the large urbanization — i mean , on steroids — with the small programs , social and economic .
i 'm referring to how immigrants , when they come to these neighborhoods , they begin to alter the one-dimensionality of parcels and properties into more socially and economically complex systems , as they begin to plug an informal economy into a garage , or as they build an illegal granny flat to support an extended family .
this socioeconomic entrepreneurship on the ground within these neighborhoods really begins to suggest ways of translating that into new , inclusive and more equitable land use policies .
this is a story of a group of teenagers that one night , a few months ago , decided to invade this space under the freeway to begin constructing their own skateboard park .
with shovels in hand , they started to dig .
two weeks later , the police stopped them .
they found out that they had been lucky because they had not begun to dig under caltrans territoy .
with this knowledge , these teenagers as skaters confronted the city .
they came to the city attorney 's office .
the city attorney told them that in order to continue the negotiation they had to become an ngo , and of course they did n't know what an ngo was .
now for many of you , this story might seem trivial or naive .
now this journey from the bottom-up to the transformation of the top-down is where i find hope today .
( applause )
look at the world .
you will find humans chasing higher education .
let 's meet some of them .
patrick .
patrick was born in liberia to a family of 20 children .
during the civil war , he and his family were forced to flee to nigeria .
there , in spite of his situation , he graduated high school with nearly perfect grades .
patrick never gave up his dream of higher education .
her parents did n't go to college , and neither did any of her siblings .
debbie has worked all her life , pays taxes , supports herself month to month , proud of the american dream , a dream that just wo n't be complete without higher education .
but debbie does n't have the savings for higher education .
she ca n't pay the tuition .
neither could she leave work .
meet wael .
he 's firsthand experiencing the misery , fear and failure imposed on his country .
he 's a big believer in education .
the higher education system failed patrick , debbie and wael , exactly as it is failing millions of potential students , millions that graduate high school , millions that are qualified for higher education , millions that want to study yet can not access for various reasons .
universities are expensive . we all know it .
in large parts of the world , higher education is unattainable for an average citizen .
this is probably the biggest problem facing our society .
higher education stopped being a right for all and became a privilege for the few .
second , cultural .
these are the reasons i founded university of the people , a nonprofit , tuition-free , degree-granting university to give an alternative , to create an alternative to those who have no other , an alternative that will be affordable and scalable , an alternative that will disrupt the current education system , open the gates to higher education for every qualified student regardless of what they earn , where they live , or what society says about them .
universities have expenses that virtual universities do n't .
they do n't exist .
actually , nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall .
by using open educational resources and the generosity of professors who are putting their material free and accessible , we do n't need to send our students to buy textbooks .
all of our materials come free .
finally , it 's our belief in peer-to-peer learning .
we use this sound pedagogical model to encourage our students from all over the world to interact and study together and also to reduce the time our professors need to labor over class assignments .
when our students are accepted , they are placed in a small classroom of 20 to 30 students to ensure that those who need personalized attention get it .
moreover , for every nine weeks ' course , they meet a new peer , a whole new set of students from all over the world .
this way , we open our students ' minds , we develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures .
by the end of each week , the students take a quiz , hand in their homework , which are assessed by their peers under the supervision of the instructors , get a grade , move to the next week .
every student with a high school diploma , sufficient english and internet connection can study with us .
we do n't use audio . we do n't use video .
we are tuition-free .
it is our mission that nobody will be left behind for financial reasons .
five years ago , it was a vision .
last month , we got the ultimate academic endorsement to our model .
university of the people is now fully accredited .
we have demonstrated that our model works .
( applause )
they 're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color .
it 's like an underwater light show .
so if you see anything under 10 meters that 's red , it 's an animal transforming and creating its own red .
this is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet .
and my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals .
so i wanted to seek this out further .
but these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights , and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue .
he really captures this entrepreneuring , creative spirit in biology .
so this is the male seahorse .
but this is all beautiful to see .
it 's creating contrast that they can indeed see .
the idea is that most of our technologies to explore the deep ocean come from oil and gas and military , who , you know , they 're not really caring to be gentle .
you do n't want to just go and crush them with a big claw .
from deep space , our universe looks like a human brain cell , and then here we are in the deep ocean , and we 're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind .
one is about a problem of generalization , and the other is about a problem of causal reasoning .
and although i 'm going to talk about work in my lab , this work is inspired by and indebted to a field .
let me start with the problem of generalization .
let 's find out .
in each movie , you 're going to see a baby doing maybe just exactly what you might expect a baby to do , and we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are .
you could do that with your eyes closed .
it 's plausibly a random sample from this population .
let 's see what the baby does .
let me show you the experimental results .
that 's not an improbable sample .
and it starts with a problem of confounded evidence that all of us have , which is that we are part of the world .
take this baby , for instance .
so in this next experiment , we 're going to give babies just a tiny bit of statistical data supporting one hypothesis over the other , and we 're going to see if babies can use that to make different decisions about what to do .
hyowon is going to try to make the toy go and succeed .
now , when the baby gets the toy , he 's going to have a choice .
this time , babies are going to see the toy work and fail in exactly the same order , but we 're changing the distribution of evidence .
one , two , three , go !
hmm , let me try again .
i think these are all important stories , and they have a lot to tell us about what it means to be human , but i want you to note that today i told you a very different story .
human minds think of altogether new ideas .
it has to be that powerful .
you know causal relationships . you know about moral reasoning .
in fact , the better i do my job , the more people hate me .
and no , i 'm not a meter maid , and i 'm not an undertaker .
i am a progressive lesbian talking head on fox news . ( applause ) so y'all heard that , right ? just to make sure , right ?
so i go on television .
i debate people who literally want to obliterate everything i believe in , in some cases , who do n't want me and people like me to even exist .
( laughter ) so what have i realized , being on the receiving end of all this ugliness ?
i do n't care if you call me a dyke . i really do n't .
one , i care that you spell it right .
( laughter ) ( applause ) just quick refresher , it 's d-y-k-e .
and second , i do n't care about the word , i care about how you use it .
are you being friendly ? are you just being naive ?
or do you really want to hurt me personally ?
emotional correctness is the tone , the feeling , how we say what we say , the respect and compassion we show one another .
and what i 've realized is that political persuasion does n't begin with ideas or facts or data .
so when i first went to go work at fox news , true confession , i expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle-dragging .
that , by the way , in case you 're paying attention , is not emotionally correct .
but liberals on my side , we can be self-righteous , we can be condescending , we can be dismissive of anyone who does n't agree with us .
in other words , we can be politically right but emotionally wrong .
conservatives are really nice .
i mean , not all of them , and not the ones who send me hate mail , but you would be surprised .
sean hannity is one of the sweetest guys i 've ever met .
we spend so much time talking past each other and not enough time talking through our disagreements , and if we can start to find compassion for one another , then we have a shot at building common ground .
so someone who says they hate immigrants , i try to imagine how scared they must be that their community is changing from what they 've always known .
or someone who says they do n't like teachers ' unions , i bet they 're really devastated to see their kid 's school going into the gutter , and they 're just looking for someone to blame .
i 'm not saying it 's easy .
an average of , like , 5.6 times per day i have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities .
this whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me , and i ai n't the dalai lama .
`` and one of my all-time favorites begins , `` '' i am not a big fan of your political leanings or your sometimes tortured logic , but i 'm a big fan of you as a person . '' '' now this guy does n't agree with me , yet . ''
( laughter ) but he 's listening , not because of what i said , but because of how i said it , and somehow , even though we 've never met , we 've managed to form a connection .
that 's emotional correctness , and that 's how we start the conversations that really lead to change .
thank you .
( applause )
i 'm a believer in global warming , and my record is good on the subject .
( laughter ) it was n't . it was 1928 .
but go back to 1912 , 100 years ago , and look at that point what we , our country , was faced with .
a hundred years ago we were looking at coal , of course , and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil .
so at that point , 1912 , we selected crude oil over whale oil and some more coal .
but as we moved on to the period now , 100 years later , we 're back really at another decision point .
what is the decision point ?
so here you are , that the cost of all this to the world is 89 million barrels of oil , give or take a few barrels , every day .
and one trillion of that goes to opec .
now if you look at the cost of opec , it cost seven trillion dollars — on the milken institute study last year — seven trillion dollars since 1976 , is what we paid for oil from opec .
but it 's the greatest transfer of wealth , from one group to another in the history of mankind .
now when you look at where is the transfer of wealth , you can see here that we have the arrows going into the mid-east and away from us .
we are policing the world , and how are we doing that ?
i would bet there are n't 10 percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world .
are we smarter than anybody else ? i 'm not sure .
if you look at where they 're located — and on this slide it 's the red blobs on there — there are five that are operating in the mid-east , and the rest of them are in the united states .
they just move back to the mid-east and those come back .
why ? why are they in the mid-east ?
so where do we go from here ?
does that continue ?
the slide you 're looking at here is 1990 to 2040 .
but if you 're going to do anything about the dependency on foreign oil , you have to address transportation .
so here we are using 20 million barrels a day — producing eight , importing 12 , and from the 12 , five comes from opec .
when you look at the biggest user and the second largest user , we use 20 million barrels and the chinese use 10 .
the chinese have a little bit better plan — or they have a plan ; we have no plan .
in the history of america , we 've never had an energy plan .
if you go forward the next 10 years and cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a barrel , you will pay 2.2 trillion .
that 's not sustainable either .
they 're over .
`` now i had people in washington last week told me , he said , `` '' the saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel . ''
`` it 's what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil . '' '' there is no free market for oil . ''
the oil is priced off the margin .
we 're headed to natural gas .
natural gas will do everything we want it to do .
it 's 130 octane fuel .
it 's 25 percent cleaner than oil .
it 's ours , we have an abundance of it .
it comes out of the ground at 130 octane .
run it through the separator and you 're ready to use it .
it 's going to be simple to accomplish this .
it 's for power generation , transportation , it 's peaking fuel , it 's all those .
do we have enough natural gas ?
look at the bar on the left . it 's 24 trillion .
it 's what we use a year .
how does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent ?
it would be three times what the saudis claim they have .
i think it 's probably 175 billion barrels .
and where i 've targeted is on the heavy-duty trucks .
you take eight million trucks — these are 18-wheelers — and take them to natural gas , reduce carbon by 30 percent , it is cheaper and it will cut our imports three million barrels .
so what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel , is the way i see it .
i do n't have to worry about the bridge to where at my age .
( laughter ) that 's your concern .
but as i said , i 'm for anything american .
i 'm back to theorist again .
if you look at the world , you have methane hydrates in the ocean around every continent .
and here you can see methane , if that 's the way you 're going to go , that there 's plenty of methane — natural gas is methane , methane and natural gas are interchangeable — but if you decide that you 're going to use some methane — and i 'm gone , so it 's up to you — but we do have plenty of methane hydrates .
so i think i 've made my point that we have to get on our own resources in america .
so there 's nothing going on that impresses me in washington on that plan , other than i 'm trying to focus on that eight million 18-wheelers .
if we could do that , i think we would take our first step to an energy plan .
if we did , we could see that our own resources are easier to use than anybody can imagine .
what happened ?
no , what happened to us , chris , is that power , it 's priced off the margin .
and so the margin is natural gas .
in a nutshell that 's what happened ?
tbp : that 's what happened .
we found out that we could go to the source rock , which were the carboniferous shales in the basins .
the first one was barnett shale in texas and then the marcellus up in the northeast across new york , pennsylvania , west virginia ; and haynesville in louisiana .
it 's my life .
now i do own stocks .
i 'm not a big natural gas producer .
ca : but natural gas is a fossil fuel .
you burn it , you release co2 .
tbp : well you 're going to have to use something .
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
ca : but i do n't think that 's right , boone .
i think you 're a person who believes in your legacy .
you 're one of the few people in a position to really swing the debate .
they just are n't , it 's a bad deal .
look at solyndra , or whatever it was .
i mean , that was told to be a bad idea 10 times , they went ahead and did it anyway .
i think it 's closer to a billion .
but chris , i think where we 're headed , the long-term , i do n't mind going back to nuclear .
and i can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be .
one , do n't build a reformer on a fault .
( laughter ) and number two , do not build a reformer on the ocean .
you ca n't — okay .
ca : one of the questions from the audience is , with fracking and the natural gas process , what about the problem of methane leaking from that , methane being a worse global warming gas than co2 ?
tbp : fracking ? what is fracking ?
ca : fracking .
tbp : i 'm teasing .
( laughter ) ca : we 've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here , you know .
i got out of school in '51 .
i witnessed my first frack job at border texas in 1953 .
i do n't know what in the hell he 's talking about .
i saw my first one in '53 .
i 've fracked over 3,000 wells in my life .
never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else .
now the largest aquifer in north america is from midland , texas to the south dakota border , across eight states — big aquifer : ogallala , triassic age .
there had to have been 800,000 wells fracked in oklahoma , texas , kansas in that aquifer .
there 's no problems .
ca : all right , so you do n't support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon .
your picture then i guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately , that we 'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive ?
ca : so how does the world get off fossil fuels ?
tbp : how do we get there ?
`` we have so much natural gas , a day will not come where you say , `` '' well let 's do n't use that anymore . '' '' you 'll keep using it . it is the cleanest of all . ''
lamta have been on natural gas for 25 years .
the ft. worth t has been on it for 25 years .
it 's because of air quality .
how in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point ?
what is at the other end of that bridge is for this audience to figure out .
tbp : i lost 150 million on the wind , okay .
yeah , sure , i 'm game for it .
because , again , i 'm trying to get energy solved for america .
and anything american will work for me .
ca : boone , i really , really appreciate you coming here , engaging in this conversation .
i think there 's a lot of people who will want to engage with you .
and that was a real gift you gave this audience .
thank you so much . ( tbp : you bet , chris . thank you . ) ( applause )
growing up in taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of chinese characters .
ever since then , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
a chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters .
the top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature — enough to read road signs , restaurant menus , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers .
today i 'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
you are ready ?
open your mouth as wide as possible until it 's square .
this is a tree .
tree .
this is a mountain .
the sun .
i call these eight characters radicals .
they are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
a person .
`` if someone walks behind , that is `` '' to follow . '' '' as the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd . ''
`` if a person stretched their arms wide , this person is saying , `` '' it was this big . '' '' the person inside the mouth , the person is trapped . ''
three trees together , we create the forest .
put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation .
two fires together , i get really hot .
three fires together , that 's a lot of flames .
set the fire underneath the two trees , it 's burning .
two suns together , prosperous .
put the sun and the moon shining together , it 's brightness .
it also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
two women together , they have an argument .
by using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 .
for example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . it 's a volcano .
this is a sun placed with the origin , because japan lies to the east of china .
so a sun , origin together , we build japan .
a japanese person .
the character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
nowadays , exile has turned into getting out .
a mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
this is a slide to remind me that i should stop talking and get off of the stage . thank you .
( applause )
so accidental discovery is not uncommon in science , but it requires more than just a happy accident .
and also , like tuberculosis in the 1950s , we do n't know what causes it .
when doctors first saw this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid , they did n't really recognize what they saw .
and they were worried that this might somehow interfere with their recovering from tuberculosis .
they were so used to looking at it from the perspective of this one disease , they could not see the larger implications for another disease .
and to be fair , it 's not entirely their fault .
it 's a tendency to only be able to think of an object in terms of its traditional use or function .
but it does make you wonder what else we 've missed .
so iproniazid and imipramine , they 're more than just a case study in repurposing .
one , they have terrible side effects .
and two , they both increase levels of serotonin , which is a chemical signal in the brain , or a neurotransmitter .
and that was 30 years ago , and since then we have mostly just worked on optimizing those drugs .
this is brain signaling , serotonin , from an ssri commercial .
so we 've focused on serotonin now for the past 30 years , often to the exclusion of other things .
and we were just piloting .
so if you look at the far left , if you put a mouse in a new space , this is the box , it 's very exciting , a mouse will walk around and explore , and you can see that pink line is actually the measure of them walking .
and we also give it another mouse in a pencil cup that it can decide to interact with .
yet the mice that had gotten that one injection of calypsol , here on your right , they were exploring , they were social .
and then we were really skeptical , because it was too good to be true .
it seemed like this one injection of calypsol was somehow protecting against stress for weeks .
and we only published this a year ago , but since then other labs have independently confirmed this effect .
so we do n't know what causes depression , but we do know that stress is the initial trigger in 80 percent of cases , and depression and ptsd are different diseases , but this is something they share in common .
right ? it is traumatic stress like active combat or natural disasters or community violence or sexual assault that causes post-traumatic stress disorder , and not everyone that is exposed to stress develops a mood disorder .
and we have always thought of it as just sort of this passive property .
it 's the absence of susceptibility factors and risk factors for these disorders .
but what if it were active ?
we had accidentally discovered the first resilience-enhancing drug .
and like i said , we only gave a tiny amount of the drug , and it lasted for weeks , and that 's not like anything you see with antidepressants .
in that case , you get the infection , you 're exposed to the bacteria , you 're sick , and then you take , say , an antibiotic which cures it , and those drugs are actually working to kill the bacteria .
antidepressants only suppress symptoms , and that is why you basically have to keep taking them for the life of the disease , which is often the length of your own life .
also , not all antidepressants are also paravaccines .
we tried prozac as well , and that had no effect .
so if this were to translate into humans , we might be able to protect people who are predictably at risk against stress-induced disorders like depression and ptsd .
as i mentioned before , repurposing can be challenging because of our prior biases .
it 's still used across the world as an anesthetic .
it 's used in children . we use it on the battlefield .
it 's actually the drug of choice in a lot of developing nations , because it does n't affect breathing .
it 's generic , it 's available .
but actually , beyond functional fixedness and mental set , there 's a real other challenge to repurposing drugs , which is policy .
this could be the beginning of the end of the mental health epidemic .
`` but as a great scientist once said , `` '' only a fool is sure of anything . ''
and her death was sudden and unexpected .
`` it 's a world that erik brynjolfsson and i are calling `` the new machine age . '' ''
`` most people , when this subject is brought up , get tense and resist it : `` '' art does n't feed me , and right now i 'm busy . ''
why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art ?
this is the theme of my talk today .
they draw with crayons on the wall .
and some kids , when they get a bit older , start to lie .
they 're shocked .
parents should celebrate .
he merely connected one sentence after another .
and you continue to make connections .
a kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller .
there 's no need .
but kids do n't mind .
kids do n't do it because someone told them to .
contemporary art , i later discovered , is n't explained by a lame story like mine .
`` he stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it `` '' bull 's head . '' '' sounds convincing , right ? ''
they get locked in .
our artistic desire does n't go away .
we become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on tv .
however , acting majors are not supposed to act .
it can be a simple theme : write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood .
and they have a magic question .
it helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs .
so what should we do now ?
which means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is , if people see it as their only choice , they will use it .
most of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world .
this is the work i do .
i met recently with a group of ethiopian activists , and they told me something that i hear a lot .
there are a variety of methods that can be used to do this .
and protest is only one .
let me give you a recent example .
and the activists realized that they could n't just keep protesting and ask the president to resign .
they needed to leave him no choice .
but on the first day of school , not a single child showed up .
this is an example of just one act of defiance in just one city .
the greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence but in making violence obsolete .
for the brands , sneakerheads are a very important demographic .
because who else is going to buy a pair of $ 8,000 back to the future sneakers ?
i have about 250 pairs , but trust me , i am small-time .
i have one of those .
and that 's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists .
and while that definitely happens and is tragic , it 's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe .
in the case of sneakers , that someone is nike .
let 's jump to retail for a second .
it 's marketing .
so nike is definitely not the stock exchange .
but that means no efficiencies , no transparency , sometimes not even authenticity .
can you imagine if that 's how stocks were bought ?
a stock market of things .
thank you .
you know , when you see a thunderstorm on the horizon and you just find yourself rooting for the storm .
i 'm german myself , so i know exactly what that feels like .
that 's the power of words , to make us feel less alone .
the way that this path is real because people wanted it to be there .
because i think that 's a lot of how we look at language .
we 're the ones that pour ourselves into it .
it brings a sense of order to a very chaotic universe .
i think a lot of us feel boxed in by how we use these words .
because remember , words are not real .
they do n't have meaning . we do .
( applause )
just see the contrast .
that you see , the horizontal axis is where you place your country .
but the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures .
and of course , it 's very beneficial in a lot of ways .
and again , here are some of the lessons .
this is bret adee opening one of his 72,000 beehives .
and then they also exhibit curiosity .
`` `` i feel like i 'm in this fog of depression that i ca n't get out of . '' ''
we can also get a gender breakdown .
metrics provides more numerical views on the data .
another technique is directly questioning people .
you know , orion facing the roaring bull .
what are the great stories of today ?
and it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky .
so , universe will open here .
now , these are n't just little points of light , little pixels .
this is a photographic representation , called snapshots .
in half a century of trying to help prevent wars , there 's one question that never leaves me : how do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return ?
fight back ? give in ?
i remember i was about 13 , glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents ' living room as soviet tanks rolled into budapest , and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down .
`` and my mother came up and said , `` '' what on earth are you doing ? '' '' and i said , `` '' i 'm going to budapest . '' '' and she said , `` '' what on earth for ? '' '' and i said , `` '' kids are getting killed there . ''
`` there 's something terrible happening . '' '' and she said , `` '' do n't be so silly . '' '' and i started to cry . ''
you need training . i 'll help you .
but i realized that what i really needed to know i could n't get from training courses .
i wanted to understand how violence , how oppression , works .
and what i 've discovered since is this : bullies use violence in three ways .
they use political violence to intimidate , physical violence to terrorize and mental or emotional violence to undermine .
and only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence .
so what does work ?
over time i 've collected about a half-dozen methods that do work — of course there are many more — that do work and that are effective .
and the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here , inside me .
and what i need to develop is self-knowledge to do that .
that means i need to know how i tick , when i collapse , where my formidable points are , where my weaker points are .
when do i give in ?
and meditation or self-inspection is one of the ways — again it 's not the only one — it 's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power .
and my heroine here — like satish 's — is aung san suu kyi in burma .
they came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns .
and she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her .
but she told the students to sit down .
and she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun , put her hand on it and lower it .
so that 's what the mastery of fear can do — not only faced with machine guns , but if you meet a knife fight in the street .
so what about our fear ?
i have a little mantra .
my fear grows fat on the energy i feed it .
how can this be made better ?
`` and you say , `` '' okay , now we 're going back to sleep . ''
( laughter ) so i did the thing .
i got up , made the cup of tea , sat down with it , did it all and i 'm here — still partly paralyzed , but i 'm here .
but anger is like gasoline , and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match , you 've got an inferno .
if we can put our anger inside an engine , it can drive us forward , it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power .
because at the beginning i was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that i just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong .
totally ineffective .
it 's okay to be angry with the thing — the nuclear weapons in this case — but it is hopeless to be angry with the people .
they are human beings just like us .
and they 're doing what they think is best .
and that 's the basis on which we have to talk with them .
so that 's the third one , anger .
they know best what to do .
and the kind of thing they 're doing is demobilizing militias , rebuilding economies , resettling refugees , even liberating child soldiers .
the british military have always been much better at this .
but there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from , and that 's a brilliant u.s. lieutenant colonel called chris hughes .
and he was leading his men down the streets of najaf — in iraq actually — and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road , screaming , yelling , furiously angry , and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified , did n't know what was going on , could n't speak arabic .
now that to me is wisdom in action .
in the moment , that 's what he did .
and it 's happening everywhere now .
you do n't believe me ?
have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last 30 years ?
`` he wrote a book called `` '' from dictatorship to democracy '' '' with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance . ''
and it 's been translated into 26 languages .
so this is what gives me hope — not just hope , this is what makes me feel very positive right now .
because finally human beings are getting it .
we 're using the kind of skills that i 've outlined : inner power — the development of inner power — through self-knowledge , recognizing and working with our fear , using anger as a fuel , cooperating with others , banding together with others , courage , and most importantly , commitment to active non-violence .
now i do n't just believe in non-violence .
i see evidence everywhere of how it works .
we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known .
and we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve .
and this open-heartedness is exactly what i 've experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since i got here yesterday .
thank you .
( applause )
there are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine , and one way is to extract human dna from ancient bones .
and from these extracts , we can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time and look for changes that might be related to adaptations , risk factors and inherited diseases .
all of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved .
and in order to understand these diseases , we need to move past studies of the human genome alone and towards a more holistic approach to human health in the past .
and first of all , what do we even study ?
skeletons are ubiquitous ; they 're found all over the place .
but of course , all of the soft tissue has decomposed , and the skeleton itself has limited health information .
mummies are a great source of information , except that they 're really geographically limited and limited in time as well .
you can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease , but they are very rare .
( laughter ) so to address this problem , i put together a team of international researchers in switzerland , denmark and the u.k .
many of you may know it by the term tartar .
they 'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope , and what they had found was things like pollen and plant starches , and they 'd found muscle cells from animal meats and bacteria .
and so what my team of researchers , what we wanted to do , is say , can we apply genetic and proteomic technology to go after dna and proteins , and from this can we get better taxonomic resolution to really understand what 's going on ?
but what was surprising to us , and also quite exciting , is we also found bacteria that normally inhabit upper respiratory systems .
and so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that , from the skeleton alone , has long decomposed .
and so by applying ancient dna sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus , we can generate immense quantities of data that then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet , infection and immunity thousands of years ago .
so what started out as an idea , is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease , right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens .
and i hope i have convinced you of the value of dental calculus .
and as a final parting thought , on behalf of future archeologists , i would like to ask you to please think twice before you go home and brush your teeth .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
and let me say just one more thing before i leave this area of governance .
in this country , if you receive stolen goods , are you not prosecuted ?
so we decided to privatize many of our enterprises .
( applause ) we — as a result , we decided to liberalize many of our markets .
the other thing we 've also done is to manage our finances better .
and that shores up our economy , makes it stable .
and we had gdp grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade to about 6.5 percent now .
we have opportunities in agriculture , like i said .
and it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars .
not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear .
and the best way to do that is by helping create jobs .
across europe and central asia , approximately one million children live in large residential institutions , usually known as orphanages .
most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment that care for children .
after all , where else would we put all of those children who do n't have any parents ?
as we know , babies are born without their full muscle development , and that includes the brain .
new parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning .
they are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children 's cleverness .
and it 's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of romania after the 1989 revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions .
i was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families .
housing 550 babies , this was ceausescu 's show orphanage , and so i 'd been told the conditions were much better .
it was hard to believe there were any children there at all , yet the director showed me into room after room , each containing row upon row of cots , in each of which lay a child staring into space .
yet i could see soiled nappies , and i could see that some of the children were distressed , but the only noise was a low , continuous moan .
over the next few days , i began to realize that this quietness was not exceptional .
the newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours , but their demands were not met , and so eventually they learned not to bother . within a few days , they were listless , lethargic , and staring into space like all the others .
over the years , many people and news reports have blamed the personnel in the institutions for the harm caused to the children , but often , one member of staff is caring for 10 , 20 , and even 40 children .
at 8 , their nappies must be changed , so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children .
since my first visit to ceausescu 's institution , i 've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries , from the czech republic to sudan .
lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors like hand-flapping , rocking back and forth , or aggression , and in some institutions , psychiatric drugs are used to control the behavior of these children , whilst in others , children are tied up to prevent them from harming themselves or others .
most of these children will never leave the institution again .
the older children bully the little ones . they learn to survive . they learn to defend themselves , or they go under .
when they leave the institution , they find it really difficult to cope and to integrate into society .
in moldova , young women raised in institutions are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers , and a russian study found that two years after leaving institutions , young adults , 20 percent of them had a criminal record , 14 percent were involved in prostitution , and 10 percent had taken their own lives .
but why are there so many orphans in europe when there has n't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years ?
in fact , more than 95 percent of these children have living parents , and societies tend to blame these parents for abandoning these children , but research shows that most parents want their children , and that the primary drivers behind institutionalization are poverty , disability and ethnicity .
the institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home .
behind each of the million children in institutions , there is usually a story of parents who are desperate and feel they 've run out of options , like natalia in moldova , who only had enough money to feed her baby , and so had to send her older son to the institution ; or desi , in bulgaria , who looked after her four children at home until her husband died , but then she had to go out to work full time , and with no support , felt she had no option but to place a child with disabilities in an institution ; or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents
every child has the right to a family , deserves and needs a family , and children are amazingly resilient .
it 's also much cheaper to provide support to families than it is to provide institutions .
one study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an institutional placement , whilst good quality foster care costs usually about 30 percent .
if we spend less on these children but on the right services , we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs .
awareness-raising is required at every level of society .
if we know people who are planning to support orphanages , we should convince them to support family services instead .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
but you know who did n't like that chapter ?
the us government .
so from 2007 to 2015 , risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison .
sadly , this is only one case of many .
now , you can see how this could be a problem , especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret .
since 9/11 , virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist .
securedrop , though , is really only a small part of the puzzle for protecting press freedom in the 21st century .
we are drowning in news .
that 's just one source .
my question is : how many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run ?
and when you look at the news through that filter , a lot falls by the wayside .
to take the top stories from the a.p . this last year , is this going to matter in a decade ?
really ? is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years ? okay , that was kind of cool . ( laughter )
but the top story of this past year was the economy , and i 'm just betting that , sooner or later , this particular recession is going to be old news .
someday , little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things .
as we heard yesterday , there 's over a billion people hungry .
britain will starve without genetically modified crops .
bill gates , fortunately , has bet a billion on [ agricultural ] research .
it seems that with or without us , life will go on .
makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there .
and if nasa does n't do it , china might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
( applause )
but it 's not fine .
i 'm just going to show you two of them .
i wanted to make a point .
emotionally , i was a wreck .
this working mother , all working mothers and all of their babies , are fine .
there 's nothing to see here .
it exists in america . it 's called fmla . it does not work .
here 's what that looks like .
labor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken .
but those things are hidden behind images like this .
america has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies .
that narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories i hear .
care to guess who they are ?
the first eight make up eight million in total population .
that 's the end of the list .
`` one woman told me , `` '' new motherhood is hard . it should n't be traumatic . ''
childbirth is a public good .
but all of us have voices .
we need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us .
he may or may not have been the first person to climb everest , more than 30 years before edmund hillary .
no one knows if he got to the top . it 's still a mystery .
`` but he was credited with coining the phrase , `` '' because it 's there . '' '' now i 'm not actually sure that he did say that . ''
`` `` '' the first question which you will ask and which i must try to answer is this : what is the use of climbing mt . everest ? ''
and my answer must at once be , it is no use .
there is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever .
we shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver , and not a gem , nor any coal or iron .
what we get from this adventure is just sheer joy , and joy , after all , is the end of life .
i sat there wondering what on earth i had gotten myself into .
and that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .
beyond that , i did n't see anyone for 10 weeks .
the north pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea , so i 'm traveling over the frozen surface of the arctic ocean .
i can try to tell you what it was like , but you 'll never know what it was like , and the more i try to explain that i felt lonely , i was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles , it was cold , nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day , the more words fall short , and i 'm unable to do it justice .
and i would add a cautionary note here , however .
in my experience , there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what 's humanly possible .
mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain , and i wonder if that 's the case whether there 's something in the challenge itself , in the endeavor , and particularly in the big , unfinished , chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us , and in my experience that 's certainly the case .
`` is there a chance you 'll see her there ? '' '' ( laughter ) but scott 's journey remains unfinished . ''
that 's the scale . the red line is obviously halfway to the pole .
and yet , if i 've learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places , it is that true , real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge , from stepping away from what 's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown .
in life , we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to , and i think metaphorically speaking , at least , we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often , if only we could summon up the courage .
thank you very much .
( applause )
i learned about the haiti earthquake by skype .
`` my wife sent me a message , `` whoa , earthquake , '' and then disappeared for 25 minutes . ''
it was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the u.s. felt .
i was afraid of a tsunami ; what i did n't realize was there was a greater terror in haiti , and that was building collapse .
we 've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in haiti .
this is a nurses ' college — there are 300 nurses studying .
the general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed .
this is the ministry of economics and finance .
aidg has worked in haiti since 2007 , providing engineering and business support to small businesses .
and after the quake , we started bringing in earthquake engineers to figure out why the buildings collapsed , to examine what was safe and what was n't .
we inspected schools and private residencies .
we inspected medical centers and food warehouses .
we inspected government buildings .
the fellow in the door , andre filitrault — who 's the director of the center for interdisciplinary earthquake engineering research at the university of buffalo — was examining it to see if it was safe to recover the archives .
the failure points were the same : walls and slabs not tied properly into columns — that 's a roof slab hanging off the building — cantilevered structures , or structures that were asymmetric , that shook violently and came down , poor building materials , not enough concrete , not enough compression in the blocks , rebar that was smooth , rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away .
and we know how to build properly .
the proof of this came in chile , almost a month later , when 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit chile .
adjusted for population density , that is less than one percent of the impact of the haitian quake .
what was the difference between chile and haiti ?
chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades .
this is xantus daniel ; he 's a mason , just a general construction worker , not a foreman , who took one of our trainings .
he took his boss aside , and he showed him the materials on confined masonry .
`` he showed him , `` '' you know , we do n't have to do this wrong . ''
`` it wo n't cost us any more to do it the right way . '' '' and they redid that building . ''
to make sure these buildings are safe , it 's not going to take policy — it 's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques .
and the fellow in the vest there , craig toten , he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this .
through haiti rewired , through build change , architecture for humanity , aidg , there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 — 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building .
the way at the bottom is a confined masonry building , where the walls are tied together , the building is symmetric , and it will stand up to an earthquake .
for all the disaster , there is an opportunity here to build better houses for the next generation , so that when the next earthquake hits , it is a disaster — but not a tragedy .
( applause )
in fact , all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating .
every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies .
one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony .
your ears ca n't hear that chord ; they can actually hear amazing things . your ears can hear 10 octaves .
your ears are always on — you have no ear lids .
ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
for example , have you ever considered that there are listening positions , places you can listen from ?
here are two of them .
men typically listen reductively .
women typically listen expansively .
if you look at these two , eye contact , facing each other , possibly both talking at the same time .
( laughter ) men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expansive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
the trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise , surrounding us all the time .
noise like this , according to the european union , is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25 percent of the population of europe .
noise kills 200,000 people a year in europe .
it 's a really big problem .
these days , you can do a similar thing , it just looks a bit cooler .
so , we 're inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us .
the second problem that comes with headphone abuse is compression .
we squash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this .
listen to this — this is an uncompressed piece of music .
( music ) and now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed . ( music )
i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two .
there is a cost of compression .
you 're having to imagine it .
it 's not good for you in the long run .
the third problem with headphones is this : deafness — noise-induced hearing disorder .
ten million americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent — roughly one in six — of american teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse .
one study at an american university found that 61 percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse .
professional hearing protectors are great ; i use some all the time .
if you 're going to use headphones , buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you do n't have to have it so loud .
seek those sounds out ; they 're good for you and so it this .
silence is beautiful .
the elizabethans described language as decorated silence .
it 's fun to get into designing with sound .
sound design is the future , and i think it 's the way we 're going to change the way the world sounds .
i 'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities , eight ways sound can improve health .
sound healing is a wonderful modality .
it 's been around for thousands of years .
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions .
and music , of course . just listening to music is good for you , if it 's music that 's made with good intention , made with love , generally .
devotional music , good — mozart , good .
first of all , listen consciously .
it 's a whole new dimension to your life and it 's wonderful to have that dimension .
secondly , get in touch with making some sound — create sound .
the voice is the instrument we all play , and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice ? get trained ; learn to sing , learn to play an instrument .
you can do this in groups as well .
and let 's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that i played you early on .
my vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things , we will take a very big step in that direction .
so i urge you to take that path .
( applause )
hi , everybody .
i 'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life .
i might look successful and happy being in front of you today , but i once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair .
when i was just about to give everything up after years of suffering , i started to rediscover the true power of music .
the comfort the music gave me was just indescribable , and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too , and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist .
i hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart , as it did for me .
( music ) ( applause ) thank you .
now , i use my music to reach people 's hearts and have found there are no boundaries .
my audience is anyone who is here to listen , even those who are not familiar with classical music .
i not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like carnegie hall and kennedy center , but also hospitals , churches , prisons , and restricted facilities for leprosy patients , just to mention a few .
now , with my last piece , i 'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun , exciting , and that it can rock you .
`` let me introduce you to my brand new project , `` baroque in rock , '' which became a golden disc most recently . ''
i think , while i 'm enjoying my life as a happy musician , i 'm earning a lot more recognition than i 've ever imagined .
changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world .
i really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you , tedsters .
i did n't know what to do , because the resin was going to kill me .
and i went to bed every night thinking about it .
it 's 18 feet long .
the ocean is made up of thousands of elements .
`` then she has an 18-foot-long serpent 's tail that connects `` '' the triptych . '' '' anyway , her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano . ''
and you kind of walk through them . it 's taking me years .
this one has a little cave in his chest .
there are the layers , you can kind of see it .
that 's a body getting split in half .
this box we 're in , the solar system is a box .
this brings you to my latest box .
( applause )
i 'm hopeful that by the end of this talk you will make a choice , and join me in standing up against hate .
i move to the back of the hall and burst into tears .
and she is .
my littler brother , a basketball-obsessed kid , had become and transformed into an accomplished young man .
i walk into my childhood home and faint into my parents ' arms , sobbing .
investigation and autopsy reports eventually revealed the sequence of events .
as she was moving in , he told yusor and her mom that he did n't like the way they looked .
there was no argument .
but the damage was already done .
even now i do n't have the words to thank him .
`` `` '' just tell me when , and i 'll have all the news channels present , '' '' he said . ''
i delivered the press statement , still wearing scrubs from the previous night .
it does n't stop there .
we have politicians reaping political and financial gains off our backs .
chances are you have n't heard khalid 's story , because it did n't make it to national news .
there may be over three million muslims in america .
that 's still just one percent of the total population .
a couple of things .
others have done the same .
thank you .
you think it 's bad to lose one arm ?
i keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
`` he says to me , `` '' we 've done some work around the country . ''
going to scratch his nose .
( applause )
i 've noticed something interesting about society and culture .
for some reason , there 's no standard syllabus , there 's no basic course .
the space bar scrolls down one page .
you can just type over it .
so i know i went super fast .
bees are the most important pollinators of our fruits and vegetables and flowers and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals .
but the ironic thing is that bees are not out there pollinating our food intentionally .
they 're flower-feeders , and as they move from flower to flower , basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart , they end up providing this valuable pollination service .
in parts of the world where there are no bees , or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees , people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand .
these people are moving pollen from flower to flower with a paintbrush .
now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon .
now this one 's the tomato tickler . ( laughter ) now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower is held very securely within the male part of the flower , the anther , and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it .
so bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it , and they do this by shaking their flight muscles at a frequency similar to the musical note c .
so they vibrate the flower , they sonicate it , and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh , and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee 's body , and she takes it home as food .
so there 's other , maybe more personal reasons , to care about bees .
there 's over 20,000 species of bees in the world , and they 're absolutely gorgeous .
these bees spend the majority of their life cycle hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem and very few of these beautiful species have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees .
and even stranger , there were these people , these beekeepers , that loved their bees like they were family , and when i put down the book , i knew i had to see this for myself .
so i went to work for a commercial beekeeper , a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in new mexico .
and i was permanently hooked .
honeybees can be considered a super-organism , where the colony is the organism and it 's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000 individual bee organisms .
now this society has no central authority .
nobody 's in charge .
my personal favorite , and one that i 've studied for many years , is their system of healthcare .
so bees have social healthcare .
so bees fly to some plants and they scrape these very , very sticky resins off the leaves , and they take them back to the nest where they cement them into the nest architecture where we call it propolis .
it kills off bacteria and molds and other germs within the colony , and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity .
humans have known about the power of propolis since biblical times .
we 've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies for human medicine , but we did n't know how good it was for the bees .
so honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over 50 million years .
bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes , and i 'll go through each of these .
in the united states , bees in fact have been in decline since world war ii .
we 're down to about two million hives of bees , we think .
we stopped planting clover and alfalfa , which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil , and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers .
and after world war ii , we started using herbicides to kill off the weeds in our farms .
many of these weeds are flowering plants that bees require for their survival .
and these monocultures extend even to crops that are good for bees , like almonds .
fifty years ago , beekeepers would take a few colonies , hives of bees into the almond orchards , for pollination , and also because the pollen in an almond blossom is really high in protein . it 's really good for bees .
and then there 's pesticides .
after world war ii , we started using pesticides on a large scale , and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests .
recently , researchers from penn state university have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food , and they 've found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it , and this includes every class of insecticides , herbicides , fungicides , and even inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active ingredient .
this small bee is holding up a large mirror .
you 've probably heard about it .
this is a new class of insecticides .
in most agricultural settings , on most of our farms , it 's only the seed that 's coated with the insecticide , and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and nectar , and if a bee consumes this lower dose , either nothing happens or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented and she may not find her way home .
public enemy number one for bees is this thing .
it 's called varroa destructor .
it 's aptly named .
it 's this big , blood-sucking parasite that compromises the bee 's immune system and circulates viruses .
i do n't know what it feels like to a bee to have a big , bloodsucking parasite running around on it , and i do n't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus , but i do know what it feels like when i have a virus , the flu , and i know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition .
they 're providing the pollination insurance alongside our honeybees .
we need all of our bees .
campaign to have them planted in public gardens , community spaces , meadows .
we need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season , from spring to fall .
we need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees , but also for migrating butterflies and birds and other wildlife .
and we need to think carefully about putting back in cover crops to nourish our soil and nourish our bees .
and we need to diversify our farms .
so maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure to a big , huge problem — just go plant flowers — but when bees have access to good nutrition , we have access to good nutrition through their pollination services .
and when bees have access to good nutrition , they 're better able to engage their own natural defenses , their healthcare , that they have relied on for millions of years .
so let the small act of planting flowers and keeping them free of pesticides be the driver of large-scale change .
( applause ) chris anderson : thank you . just a quick question .
what 's your hope/depression level on this ?
about 20 years ago , we were at a 15-percent loss .
so it 's getting precarious .
ca : that 's not 30 percent a year , that 's — ms : yes , thirty percent a year .
ca : thank you .
( applause )
( applause )
despite all the technological advances — computers , i.t. , communications , telecommunications , the internet .
enigma number two : why is there so little engagement at work ?
disengaging their colleagues .
the way we organize is based on two pillars .
now , we try to refine them , we try to combine them .
i forgot all the metrics , incentives , committees , middle offices and interfaces .
and every time there is a new requirement , we use the same approach .
an automotive company , the engineering division is a five-dimensional matrix .
so therefore the new requirement is repairability , making cars easy to repair .
if repairability is the new requirement , the solution is to create a new function , mr. repairability .
and mr. repairability creates the repairability process .
that came on top of 25 other kpis .
what percentage of these people is variable compensation ?
twenty percent at most , divided by 26 kpis , repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent .
what difference did it make in their actions , their choices to simplify ? zero .
now , in front of the new complexity of business , the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines .
how the parts work together .
you know , you could call it cooperation , basically .
whenever people cooperate , they use less resources . in everything .
when we do n't cooperate we need more time , more equipment , more systems , more teams .
no , they will refuse .
how do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation ?
they create a middle office .
what happens one year later ?
look , at home i have two tvs . why ?
( laughter ) not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife .
if i did n't love my wife , one tv would be enough : you will watch my favorite football game , if you are not happy , how is the book or the door ?
definitely , these approaches are obsolete .
to deal with complexity , to enhance the nervous system , we have created what we call the smart simplicity approach based on simple rules .
simple rule number one : understand what others do .
what is their real work ?
how can you reinforce your managers as integrators ?
by removing layers .
and we end up with the encyclopedia britannica of rules .
you need to increase the quanitity of power so that you can empower everybody to use their judgment , their intelligence .
you must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooperate , to move out of insulation .
create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions .
this is what the automotive company did when they saw that mr. repairability had no impact .
you need also to increase reciprocity , by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient .
when you remove these buffers , you hold me by the nose , i hold you by the ear .
you create more value with lower cost .
the real battle is not against competitors .
this is rubbish , very abstract .
when do we meet competitors to fight them ?
only you can fight , can do it .
my desire was to make it as a trek .
i was still there .
merci . we have to prepare for the following performance , and i have a question for you , and the question is this : you show up in places like the ones you just have shown us , and you are carrying a camera and i assume that you are welcome but you are not always absolutely welcome .
that 's what it taught me to travel , to trust the memory of the body more than the memory of the brain .
the respect is stepping forward , not stepping backward , and i really think that by engaging your body in the moment , in the ceremony , in the places , people welcome you and understand your energy .
it 's correct ?
vm : my idea is that i think that as long as we do n't cut , in a way , as long as we let the viewer watch , more and more viewers are going to feel closer , are going to get closer to the moment , to that moment and to that place .
i really think of that as a matter of respecting the viewer , to not cut all the time from one place to another , to just let the time go .
just before coming to tedglobal , you have actually been traveling around the country for that .
tell us a couple of things .
`` vm : `` '' híbridos '' '' is — i really believe brazil , far from the cliches , is the greatest religious country in the world , the greatest country in terms of spirituality and in experimentations in spiritualities . ''
vm : i guess four years ago , four years in my first travel .
bg : so it was one of your first ones in brazil .
vm : it was amongst the first ones in brazil , yeah .
i shot the film in recife , in the place where he is from .
bg : so let 's introduce him . who are we waiting for ?
vm : i 'll just make it very short .
it 's a very great honor for me to welcome onstage one of the greatest brazilian musicians of all time .
please welcome naná vasconcelos .
bg : naná vasconcelos !
( applause ) ( music ) naná vasconcelos : let 's go to the jungle . ( applause )
let 's click down now to the decade scale .
the second explanation is that in many times and places , there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap .
he built minarets with their heads .
many hazaras were sold into slavery , and many others fled the country for neighboring iran and pakistan .
it involves young kids dancing for warlords and powerful men in the society .
he was taken to another province , where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends .
when it came time to leave pakistan , australia seemed the obvious choice .
it was a desperate decision to take , to leave everything behind , and no one makes this decision easily .
shabbir and nawroz were never seen again .
it was a thick forest .
then , after spending the night on the beach , we found a jetty and coconuts .
they did not allow me to take any other boat to risk my life .
but it had happened to be a little bit different with me .
not every asylum seeker is lucky like me .
it is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate , in limbo .
surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand .
i want that to sink in for a second : our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance first .
so , after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call — anytime , anywhere — you might imagine that government officials are not very happy .
and in fact , that 's what 's happening .
now , look — i 'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view .
we live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world , and there really are bad people out there .
the foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught .
i want you to use these tools .
the newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit .
my solution : forget micro-entrepreneurs .
one : you loan 200 dollars to each of 500 banana farmers allowing them to dry their surplus bananas and fetch 15 percent more revenue at the local market .
but why pan-african ?
so , how do you go about studying the brain ?
so , how do you do imitation ? why is imitation important ?
if you go back in time about [ 75,000 ] to 100,000 years ago , let 's look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago .
and there is whole chains of neurons around this room , talking to each other .
i 've been up to its front gates .
and there 's dan etete .
and will the people of congo , will they ever get their money back ?
it is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence , and i believe this is true , especially when i hear president obama often talk about the korean education system as a benchmark of success .
well , i can tell you that , in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the korean school system , also known as pressure cooker , not everyone can do well in that environment .
why bows ?
i 'm not quite sure .
perhaps , in the face of constant pressure , my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows .
if you think about it , the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times .
the area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the joseon dynasty , where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves .
in order to raise the historical awareness of this fact , the government has planted mulberry trees .
the seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 olympics .
as i fell deeper into bow making , i began to search far and beyond my neighborhood .
i would bring the branches home , riding buses and subways , barely holding them in my hands .
( laughter ) in the privacy of my room , covered in sawdust , i would saw , trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape .
my mother had to do a lot of explaining , telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson .
in that process , i tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow .
i also worked with many different types of wood , such as maple , yew and mulberry , and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that i mentioned before .
the most effective bow for me would be like this .
two : belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight , which means more power .
three : sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage .
and four : horn used to store energy in compression .
learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me .
you see , i searched far and wide , but never bothered to look close and near .
from this realization , i began to take interest in korean history , which had never inspired me before .
now , i am going to show you how my bow works .
and let 's see how this one works .
( noise of shooting arrow ) ( applause ) a bow may function in a simple mechanism , but in order to make a good bow , a great amount of sensitivity is required .
each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being , and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow .
i may be an [ odd ] student with unconventional interests , but i hope i am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you .
we live in tenuous times .
in fact , for the first time in american history , the majority of parents do not think that their kids will be better off than they were .
but when i read this historic poll for the first time , it did n't actually make me feel sad .
it felt like a provocation .
`` `` '' better off '' '' — based on whose standards ? ''
those are nearly extinct .
ok , so is better off just a number ?
median per capita income has been flat since about 2000 , adjusted for inflation .
turns out , it has more to do with community and creativity than dollars and cents .
but , too often we let the conversation stop there .
we talk about poverty as if it were a monolithic experience ; about the poor as if they were solely victims .
part of what i 've learned in my research and reporting is that the art of living well is often practiced most masterfully by the most vulnerable .
now , if necessity is the mother of invention , i 've come to believe that recession can be the father of consciousness .
how should we work ?
and if you 're trying to do the math — there were six sets of twins .
my parents made sure that i grew up on a kind of steady ground that allows one to question and risk and leap .
so let 's dig into this first question : how should we work ?
`` my mom called it `` '' just making it work . '' '' today i hear life coaches call it `` '' a portfolio career . '' '' whatever you call it , more and more men are craving these whole , if not harried , lives . ''
they 're waking up to their desire and duty to be present fathers and sons .
now , this means the nine-to-five no longer works for anyone .
`` so we need to stop asking kids , `` what do you want to be when you grow up ? '' ''
`` and start asking them , `` '' how do you want to be when you grow up ? '' '' their work will constantly change . ''
we need to reinvent labor organizing .
now , how about the second question : how should we live ?
we should live like our immigrant ancestors .
two-thirds of those who are living with multiple generations under one roof say it 's improved their relationships .
some people are choosing to share homes not with family , but with other people who understand the health and economic benefits of daily community .
and people over 65 are especially prone to be looking for these alternative living arrangements .
they understand that their quality of life depends on a mix of solitude and solidarity .
which is true of all of us when you think about it , young and old alike .
now , i 've experienced this firsthand .
it 's good common sense , right ?
the most reliable wealth is found in relationship .
in fact , if you 're a failure or you think you 're a failure , i 've got some good news for you : you might be a success by standards you have not yet honored .
maybe you 're a mediocre earner but a masterful father .
if you 're a textbook success , the implications of what i 'm saying could be more grim for you .
in the midst of such widespread uncertainty , we may , in fact , be insecure .
but we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple .
we can turn inward , lose faith in the power of institutions to change — even lose faith in ourselves .
and so i think we can roll the video that we have .
we 'll fly outside it here , just to see this sort of containment .
that was a desk took 40-some years to build .
that 's arthur leipzig 's original photograph i loved .
i mean , this was 16-millimeter safety film .
she 's still there . she 's there this morning , actually .
i used to be a photographer for many years .
and i was paying for this myself , so i asked the translator if it would be ok if i stayed for the week .
her mother was not raising her , her grandmother was raising her .
and this man came to the door and kind of barked something in korean .
and just — i want him to understand what happens if she stays here .
they were yelling at him , they were — it got to be really ugly .
and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly , so during the day i always left the window open .
she 's being baptized .
gene is looking a little older .
now , extinction is a different kind of death .
we did n't really realize that until 1914 , when the last passenger pigeon , a female named martha , died at the cincinnati zoo .
this had been the most abundant bird in the world that 'd been in north america for six million years .
flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long used to darken the sun .
what happened ?
these birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton , and it was easy to do because when those big flocks came down to the ground , they were so dense that hundreds of hunters and netters could show up and slaughter them by the tens of thousands .
it was the cheapest source of protein in america .
by the end of the century , there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers .
this made people realize that the same thing was about to happen to the american bison , and so these birds saved the buffalos .
but a lot of other animals were n't saved .
it was hunted to death for its feathers .
there was sort of a movie made about it recently .
the documentation of this animal goes back to the lascaux cave paintings .
it went extinct in 2000 .
there was a marvelous animal , a marsupial wolf called the thylacine in tasmania , south of australia , called the tasmanian tiger .
sorrow , anger , mourning .
what if you could find out that , using the dna in museum specimens , fossils maybe up to 200,000 years old could be used to bring species back , what would you do ? where would you start ?
well , you 'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there .
i started with my wife , ryan phelan , who ran a biotech business called dna direct , and through her , one of her colleagues , george church , one of the leading genetic engineers who turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons and a lot of confidence that methodologies he was working on might actually do the deed .
so he and ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the wyss institute in harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons , conservation ornithologists , bioethicists , and fortunately passenger pigeon dna had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named beth shapiro .
then the question is , can you reassemble , with that genome , the whole bird ?
george church thinks you can .
`` so in his book , `` '' regenesis , '' '' which i recommend , he has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species , and he has a machine called the multiplex automated genome engineering machine . ''
you try combinations of genes that you write at the cell level and then in organs on a chip , and the ones that win , that you can then put into a living organism . it 'll work .
the precision of this , one of george 's famous unreadable slides , nevertheless points out that there 's a level of precision here right down to the individual base pair .
it 's called an allele .
now along the way , george points out that his technology , the technology of synthetic biology , is currently accelerating at four times the rate of moore 's law .
genetically , the band-tailed pigeon already is mostly living passenger pigeon .
there 's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon .
now , when it 's frozen that deep , minus 196 degrees celsius , the cells are intact and the dna is intact .
but some species that we killed off totally we could consider bringing back to a world that misses them .
thank you .
( applause ) chris anderson : thank you .
you 're going to uncork some sort of pandora 's box of who-knows-what . do they have a point ?
now , there 's the shifting baseline problem , which is , so when these things come back , they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love .
we will get woolly mammoths back .
i want to tell you two stories about this rising africa .
so what has rwanda said ?
you see pictures of children with flies on their faces , carcasses of dead animals and so on .
now these countries , 32 countries , came together under the auspices of the african union and decided to form an organization called the african risk capacity .
the african risk capacity last year paid 26 million dollars to mauritania , senegal and niger .
in an uncertain global environment , commodity prices have fallen .
so let me talk about six things that i think we did right .
so that was number one .
the third thing was loss-making enterprises .
and this mobile money is also providing a platform for access to alternative energy .
you know , people who can now pay for solar the same way they pay for cards for their telephone .
so this was a very good development , something that went right .
we also invested more in education and health , not enough , but there were some improvements .
the other thing was that conflicts decreased .
new types of conflicts have emerged , and i 'll refer to those later .
so based on all this , there 's also some differentiation on the continent that i want you to know about , because even as the doom and gloom is here , there are some countries — côte d'ivoire , kenya , ethiopia , tanzania and senegal are performing relatively well at the moment .
let me mention eight things .
we did n't create jobs for our youth .
the second thing that we did is that the quality of growth was not good enough .
so we created more billionaires .
and population growth is something that we do n't have enough of a dialogue about on the continent .
that is the road to really working on this particular issue .
the fifth thing is that we did n't invest enough in infrastructure .
the total consumption is equivalent to that of spain .
we are not creating enough decent manufacturing jobs for our youth , and trade among ourselves is low .
only about 12 percent of our trade is among ourselves .
so that 's another serious problem .
corruption is an issue that we have not yet gotten a good enough handle on , and we have to fight tooth and nail , that and increased transparency in the way we manage our economies and the way we manage our finances .
we also need to be wary of new conflicts , new types of conflicts , such as we have with boko haram in my country , nigeria , and with al-shabaab in kenya .
so we have to find a way to educate better .
now , where do we go from there ?
i believe that the way forward is to learn to manage success .
very often , when people succeed or countries succeed , they forget what made them succeed .
managing the economy while creating stability is vital , getting prices right , and policy consistency .
we must .
the most important thing is power .
we have to make our countries transparent .
and above all , we have to engage our young people .
we have genius in our young people .
i see it every day .
they have strength , and we have to unleash that strength so that they can contribute to the continent .
i strongly believe that when we do all of these things , we find that the rising africa narrative is not a fluke .
it 's a trend .
thank you .
how have you been handling this ?
ngozi okonjo-iweala : it 's been very difficult .
it 's a very difficult subject .
they fight back , and the issue for you is when they try to intimidate you , do you give up , or do you fight on ?
do you find a way to stay on and fight back ?
and the answer that i had with the teams i worked with is we have to fight on .
and even out of government , we continued to make that point .
in our countries , nobody , nobody is going to fight corruption for us but us .
and therefore , that comes with consequences , and we just have to do the best we can .
thank you .
it impacts everything .
hockey .
his formula , i 've learned , involved two parts .
as for terrorism , it 's now extremely rare .
so they waged their war with extraordinary delicacy .
it shattered the political paralysis that had gripped it for years .
now , this peña hardly inspired much confidence at first .
bueno .
and it had to rethink its identity .
number two , there 's power in promiscuous thinking .
and given the state of the world today , there 's really no other option .
so that 's getting a little more closer to a personal experience .
i mean , that 's 2005 figures .
we just have n't caught up with the actual realities of this .
it 's keeping the lights on .
it 's been so successful , they 've now taken over the strip across the street .
this one is one of my favorites , belmar .
by 1995 , the mall has died .
you want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
we need to be able to target which areas really should be re-greened .
two , in a hundred years , thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors .
be who you to want to be , not who they want you to be .
five weeks ago i had total hip replacement surgery .
finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting — almost a year .
this youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line .
`` `` after you . '' `` oh , no , no . after you . '' ''
happiness is the freedom of choice .
so today 's top chef class is in how to rob a bank , and it 's clear that the general public needs guidance , because the average bank robbery nets only 7,500 dollars .
( applause )
you get different kinds of psychopaths .
( laughter )
the exercise has three parts and begins with something that we all know how to do , which is how to make toast .
the toast is then deposited for some time .
it 's about visualizing the experience that people have .
but i think it 's obvious that even though these drawings are really wildly different , they share a common quality , and i 'm wondering if you can see it .
i do n't really understand this . a lot of mba students do this .
well , with cards , most people tend to draw clear , more detailed , and more logical nodes .
so sticky note systems are not only more fluid , they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings .
so what happens then ?
oh , and by the way , if they do it in complete silence , they do it much better and much more quickly .
so here 's some key lessons that can emerge from this .
so that 's interesting .
and i 'm convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links really have an edge .
and the practice is really pretty simple .
what 's really important to know is that it 's the conversations that are the important aspects , not just the models themselves .
so next time you 're confronted with an interesting challenge , remember what design has to teach us .
make your ideas visible , tangible , and consequential .
it 's simple , it 's fun , it 's powerful , and i believe it 's an idea worth celebrating .
this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true .
or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge .
so i 'm going to tell you a little bit about reimagining food .
i 've been interested in food for a long time .
in fact , understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking — some of the chemistry , some of the physics and so forth .
but that 's not in any of those books .
there 's also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed , some about new aesthetics , new approaches to food .
in order to learn them , you have to go work in those restaurants .
and finally , there 's the old way of viewing food is the old way .
and so a few years ago — fours years ago , actually — i set out to say , is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder ?
is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?
this is a picture called a cutaway .
this is actually the first picture i took in the book .
and this magic view allows you to see all of what 's happening while the broccoli steams .
then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact .
one is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli .
steaming ought to be faster .
it turns out it is n't because of something called film condensation , and this explains that .
`` well , that first cutaway picture worked , so we said , `` '' okay , let 's do some more . '' '' so here 's another one . ''
we discovered why woks are the shape they are .
( laughter ) and one of our canning cutaways .
here 's our hamburger cutaway .
of course , you 're not actually working the whole time .
the point of this cutaway is to show people a view of hamburgers they have n't seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers , because , believe it or not , there is something to the physics and chemistry — in particular , those flames underneath the burger .
mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing , or burning .
and the answer is : no , not really ; we use a machine shop .
so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world .
( laughter ) we cut a $ 5,000 restaurant oven in half .
`` the manufacturer said , `` what would it take for you to cut one in half ? '' ''
`` i said , `` '' it would have to show up free . '' '' and so it showed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half . ''
the great thing is , when you cut something in half , you have another half .
like for the hamburger , we just cut the damn barbecue .
and so those coals that kept falling off the edge , we kept having to put them back up .
what happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh !
this is fourier 's law of heat conduction .
we have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it .
it 's a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt , and where he got his inspiration .
it turned out he was hired by a scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey .
so as you move vertically away from this surface , the heat falls off .
as you move side to side , it moves off .
that horn-shaped region is what we call the sweet spot .
that 's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent .
so that 's the place where you really want to cook .
and it 's got this funny horn-shaped thing , which as far as i know , again , the first cookbook to ever do this .
now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it .
you know , there 's two ways you can make a product .
you can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want , or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it .
as it comes out of the grinder , you just have a little tray , and you just take it off in little passes , build it up , slice it vertically .
we also have things about how to make the bun .
there 's a mushroom , ketchup — it goes on and on .
is n't that beautiful ?
the key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of 1,600 .
now i 'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual .
we have a chapter on gels .
well , if you have a high-speed camera , and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around , pretty soon somebody does this .
anyway , here 's the book .
2,438 pages .
and they 're nice big pages too .
these are the maasais .
he came home once a year .
i was the first . there were my sisters and a couple of other girls , and as i approached her , she looked at me , and i sat down .
she 's beaten .
we have .
we can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion .
the electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times .
this journey will take us all the way down to the nano world .
and we all need food .
in a universe of possibilities .
( laughter ) but , what if we 're not ?
what if , out there , others are asking and answering similar questions ?
we , all of us , are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from .
so , what exactly is seti ?
we 've discovered over 350 in the last 14 years , including the small planet , announced earlier this week , which has a radius just twice the size of the earth .
now , i 'm going to try a trick , and recreate an experiment from this morning .
now , up there , 20 feet above the stage , that 's 10 trillion .
and the nearest star is 4.2 light years away , which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here .
and the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away , and the nearest galaxy to us , 2.5 million light years .
that means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago .
and we 're a very young technology in an old galaxy , and we do n't yet know whether it 's possible for technologies to persist .
let me talk about a relatively small number .
and that 's the length of time that the earth was lifeless .
now drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence , but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft , and that 's that terrestrial technology can interfere with the search for extraterrestrial technology .
we 've been searching ever since , but it 's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains .
all of the concerted seti efforts , over the last 40-some years , are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans .
and no one would decide that the ocean was without fish on the basis of one glass of water .
and over those long distances , its signal is very faint when it reaches us .
`` 2009 is the 400th anniversary of galileo 's first use of the telescope , darwin 's 200th birthday , the 150th anniversary of the publication of `` '' on the origin of species , '' '' the 50th anniversary of seti as a science , the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the seti institute as a non-profit , and of course , the 25th anniversary of ted . ''
and in 2009 , change has come to washington , with a promise to put science in its rightful position .
`` and it would n't simply change everything , it would change everything all at once . '' '' so , if that 's right , why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds ? ''
`` i think it 's a problem of completion and delivery , because the fine print said , `` '' what game-changing ideas and scientific developments would you expect to live to see ? '' '' so , we have a fulfillment problem . ''
the first step would be to tap into the global brain trust , to build an environment where raw data could be stored , and where it could be accessed and manipulated , where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient .
and then , we 'd like to augment the automated search with human insight .
i 'd sit and i 'd gather with my family and watch the tv .
it was always the people screaming and running that really got me the most , especially those terrified-looking children .
i was n't quite sure what exactly i wanted to do .
refugee camp teachers and other parents are just like them — part of a new refugee community who 's struggling with new needs .
how could we help these families ?
the families were struggling with things much bigger than they could cope with .
60 percent of the 3,000 families responded .
at that point i realized that actually hala was probably much older than 13 .
hala simply could no longer cope .
this is a parenting struggle with a really tough ending , but sadly , it 's not uncommon .
if you have been through a devastating time in your life , if you have lost someone or something you really care about , how would you continue to cope ?
these needs must be prioritized by ngo workers , policy makers , the who , the unhcr and every single one of us in whatever capacity it is that we function in our society .
when these family needs are prioritized , interventions for children in humanitarian settings will prioritize and recognize the primary role of the family in supporting children .
we need to stop wars .
thank you .
and how do you bring those two things together ?
why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence ?
it 's there for our use , on some level .
so , here 's steven alone , sharing this story in the world .
look at this hiv patient down here , zinny .
i want to talk to the 58 patients down here who are taking four milligrams a day .
i do n't even know what a medical record is .
no one 's ever had this kind of information .
it 's actually scary . it 's beautiful .
hawa abdi : many people — 20 years for somalia — [ were ] fighting .
so there was no job , no food .
children , most of them , became very malnourished , like this .
deqo mohamed : so as you know , always in a civil war , the ones affected most [ are ] the women and children .
so our patients are women and children .
and they are in our backyard .
it 's our home . we welcome them .
that 's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people , where 75 percent of them are women and children .
dm : every morning we have about 400 patients , maybe more or less .
and as you can see , it 's the women who are carrying the children ; it 's the women who come into the hospitals ; it 's the women [ are ] building the houses .
that 's their house .
would you explain the rules for admission ?
but there are only two rules .
the second : no man can beat his wife .
if he beat , we will put [ him ] in jail , and we will call the eldest people .
until they identify this case , we 'll never release him .
that 's our two rules .
( applause ) the other thing that i have realized , that the woman is the most strong person all over the world .
we can reconcile .
we can do everything .
and we have a little storage room where we converted a jail .
pm : you 're running a medical clinic .
it brought much , much needed medical care to people who would n't get it .
talk to me about your decision , dr. abdi , and your decision , dr. mohamed , to work together — for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances .
ha : my age — because i was born in 1947 — we were having , at that time , government , law and order .
my mother died , unfortunately , when i was 12 years [ old ] .
then my father allowed me to proceed [ with ] my hope .
my mother died in [ a ] gynecology complication , so i decided to become a gynecology specialist .
so dr. deqo has to explain .
dm : for me , my mother was preparing [ me ] when i was a child to become a doctor , but i really did n't want to .
i loved it , but it did n't work .
and i thought , maybe i can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist .
( laughter ) so i went to russia , and my mother also , [ during the ] time of [ the ] soviet union .
so that 's how i decided [ to do ] the same .
she 's here . she 's also a doctor .
she graduated in russia also .
( applause ) and to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war — when i was 16 , and my sister was 11 , when the civil war broke out .
but i remained with those people , and i was trying to do something — [ any ] little thing i [ could ] do .
i succeeded in my place .
now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other , who are not fighting .
but we try to stand on our feet , to do something , little things , we can for our people .
when they come to me , they help me to treat the people , to help .
pm : what 's the best part of working with your mother , and the most challenging part for you ?
she always expects us to do more .
that 's the best part .
it is not like beautiful offices here , 20 patients , you 're tired .
pm : but you do it for good reasons .
( applause ) wait . wait .
ha : thank you .
( applause ) ha : thank you very much . dm : thank you very much .
if you remember that first decade of the web , it was really a static place .
they are a site , along with others , that has allowed people to create an online persona with very little technical skill , and people responded by putting huge amounts of personal data online .
so the result is that we have behavioral , preference , demographic data for hundreds of millions of people , which is unprecedented in history .
yeah , the dad was really upset .
so that 's the kind of thing that we do when we 're predicting stuff about you on social media .
one of them is a sociological theory called homophily , which basically says people are friends with people like them .
so this is pretty complicated stuff , right ?
how do you know that you 've liked something that indicates a trait for you that 's totally irrelevant to the content of what you 've liked ?
and i see that as a real problem going forward .
and in some respects , i think that that would be most effective , but the problem is we 'd actually have to do it .
and so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users ?
so that gives us an advantage over the law side .
i 'm going to talk today about the pleasures of everyday life .
but i want to begin with a story of an unusual and terrible man .
he went through europe , through world war ii , stealing , extorting and occasionally buying various paintings for his collection .
and what he really wanted was something by vermeer .
hitler had two of them , and he did n't have any .
world war ii came to an end , and goering was captured , tried at nuremberg and ultimately sentenced to death .
and at some point the dutch police came into amsterdam and arrested van meegeren .
but he did n't confess to treason .
`` i painted it myself ; i 'm a forger . '' '' now nobody believed him . ''
`` and he said , `` '' i 'll prove it . ''
he painted a beautiful vermeer .
there 's a lot more to be said about van meegeren , but i want to turn now to goering , who 's pictured here being interrogated at nuremberg .
even for a nazi , he was a terrible man .
but you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery .
he had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that .
it looked the same , but it had a different origin , it was a different artwork .
`` in particular , `` '' the supper at emmaus '' '' which was viewed as vermeer 's finest masterpiece , his best work — people would come [ from ] all over the world to see it — was actually a forgery . ''
and when that was discovered , it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum .
i 'm a psychologists — why do origins matter so much ?
why do we respond so much to our knowledge of where something comes from ?
among other things , if you want to show off how rich you are , how powerful you are , it 's always better to own an original than a forgery because there 's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries .
i do n't doubt that that plays some role , but what i want to convince you of today is that there 's something else going on . i want to convince you
that humans are , to some extent , natural born essentialists .
what i mean by this is we do n't just respond to things as we see them , or feel them , or hear them .
so i want to suggest that pleasure is deep — and that this is n't true just for higher level pleasures like art , but even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences .
so take food .
would you eat this ?
some of you would eat it if it 's beef , but not pork .
few of you would eat it if it 's a rat or a human .
that 's not so surprising .
how do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk , but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk — to think they taste better ?
they get people into a fmri scanner , and while they 're lying there , through a tube , they get to sip wine .
but if you believe you 're drinking expensive stuff , parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a christmas tree .
it 's not just that you say it 's more pleasurable , you say you like it more , you really experience it in a different way .
or take sex .
and if you simply show people these pictures , they 'll say these are fairly attractive people .
you probably think the picture on the left is male , the one on the right is female .
( laughter ) it will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are .
( laughter ) a particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as capgras syndrome .
this was recorded in 1931 .
`` `` '' research described a woman with capgras syndrome who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover . '' '' but that was before she got capgras syndrome . ''
`` after she got it , `` '' she was happy to report that she has discovered that he possessed a double who was rich , virile , handsome and aristocratic . '' '' of course , it was the same man , but she was seeing him in different ways . ''
as a third example , consider consumer products .
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
the bubble gum was chewed up by pop star britney spears and sold for several hundreds of dollars .
with my colleagues george newman and gil diesendruck , we 've looked to see what sort of factors , what sort of history , matters for the objects that people like .
`` then we asked them , `` how much would you pay for george clooney 's sweater ? '' ''
and the answer is a fair amount — more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you did n't adore .
then we asked other groups of subjects — we gave them different restrictions and different conditions .
`` so for instance , we told some people , `` '' look , you can buy the sweater , but you ca n't tell anybody you own it , and you ca n't resell it . '' '' that drops the value of it , suggesting that that 's one reason why we like it . ''
`` as my wife put it , `` '' you 've washed away the clooney cooties . '' '' ( laughter ) so let 's go back to art . ''
that 's not because , or it 's not simply because , i 'm a snob and want to boast about having an original .
rather , it 's because i want something that has a specific history .
in the case of artwork , the history is special indeed .
they may look alike , but they have a different history .
who here likes the work of jackson pollock ?
okay . who here , it does nothing for them ?
i use jackson pollock on purpose as an example because there 's a young american artist who paints very much in the style of jackson pollock , and her work was worth many tens of thousands of dollars — in large part because she 's a very young artist .
this is marla olmstead who did most of her work when she was three years old .
the interesting thing about marla olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program 60 minutes ii into their house to film her painting .
when this came out on television , the value of her art dropped to nothing .
it was the same art , physically , but the history had changed .
i 've been focusing now on the visual arts , but i want to give two examples from music .
this is joshua bell , a very famous violinist .
and here 's a brief clip of this .
he actually made 20 dollars more than that , but he did n't count it .
because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the video — she comes up .
she had heard him at the library of congress a few weeks before at this extravagant black-tie affair .
so she 's stunned that he 's standing in a subway station .
and how you think about what you 're experiencing , your beliefs about the essence of it , affect how it hurts .
one lovely experiment was done by kurt gray and dan wegner .
so it was a series of five painful shocks .
the first shock is recorded as very painful .
the pain gets less .
in the other condition , they 're told that the person in the next room is shocking them on purpose — knows they 're shocking them .
the first shock hurts like hell .
`` the point was nicely summarized by the poet john milton who wrote , `` '' the mind is its own place , and in itself can make a heaven of hell , a hell of heaven . '' '' and i 'll end with that . thank you . ''
but for this pill to get to your head , where the pain is , it goes through your stomach , intestines and various other organs first .
and this is a big problem , particularly in hiv patients .
`` `` '' how is that possible ? '' '' you may ask . ''
yes . a cure for hiv .
when i was 22 years old , i was lucky enough to find my calling when i fell into making radio stories .
so i decided to pick up my tape recorder and find out more .
over the next 15 years , i made many more radio documentaries , working to shine a light on people who are rarely heard from in the media .
over and over again , i 'd see how this simple act of being interviewed could mean so much to people , particularly those who had been told that their stories did n't matter .
in 1998 , i made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels on the bowery in manhattan .
guys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades .
many people think of it as , if this was to be our last conversation , what would i want to ask of and say to this person who means so much to me ?
people treated the experience with incredible respect , and amazing conversations happened inside .
i want to play just one animated excerpt from an interview recorded at that original grand central booth .
josh has asperger 's syndrome .
they usually have obsessions .
sl : you were pretty loud , but amy 's was more high-pitched .
( applause ) david isay : after this story ran on public radio , josh received hundreds of letters telling him what an amazing kid he was .
his mom , sarah , bound them together in a book , and when josh got picked on at school , they would read the letters together .
i think it 's because you 're hearing something authentic and pure at this moment , when sometimes it 's hard to tell what 's real and what 's an advertisement .
nobody comes to storycorps to get rich .
nobody comes to get famous .
and i think for the first years of storycorps , you could argue that there was some kind of a selection bias happening , but after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person in every part of the country — rich , poor , five years old to 105 , 80 different languages , across the political spectrum — you have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something .
i 've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen , like this interview between a betting clerk in brooklyn named danny perasa who brought his wife annie to storycorps to talk about his love for her .
and i say it so often . i say it to remind you that as dumpy as i am , it 's coming from me .
you write a love letter to me every morning .
dp : it 's a romantic weather report .
ap : and i love you . i love you . i love you .
what else have i learned ?
slowly and remarkably , they became friends , and when he was finally released from the penitentiary , oshea actually moved in next door to mary .
lm : you do n't have to apologize . you do n't have to tiptoe .
i mean , i wish i had a softer voice maybe , but now i walk in love and i try to live that way every day .
di : now i walk in love .
it takes some courage to have these conversations .
and it 's hard and it takes courage , but that 's why we 're alive , right ?
so , the ted prize .
those are the key ingredients .
so the first part of the wish is already underway .
and how they want to be remembered .
that 's how great dreams are .
this is some of the lettuce that we grew .
it included an exterior loading dock .
they wanted it messy , and we were happy to oblige .
the big , real car works every time ; there 's no problem about it .
i gave out homework assignments .
but we need more .
it sounds impossible , but in fact , it was quite true .
also , according to interpol , as much as 90 percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging , like the illegal logging that we saw .
as you can see , this is a device up in a tree .
what you can see from here , perhaps , is that they are pretty well obscured up in the tree canopy at a distance .
on the very second day , it picked up illegal chainsaw noises .
this is the moment where we 've actually arrived close to where the loggers are .
this is the moment where you can see where i 'm actually regretting perhaps the entire endeavor .
the auditorium was empty .
this was the most exciting day of vera 's life .
there 'd been a mistake .
and he stood up twisting , pounding down on the keys , desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row .
it 's an electrifying performance .
and the audience loved it .
keith jarrett had been handed a mess .
he had embraced that mess , and it soared .
he did n't want to play .
we do n't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools .
and so they learned more .
the psychologist shelley carson has been testing harvard undergraduates for the quality of their attentional filters .
but some people really struggle with that .
some of carson 's undergraduate subjects struggled with that .
let 's talk about complexity science .
there are lots and lots of different variables , the operating temperature , the materials , all the different dimensions , the shape .
so what do you do ?
but you know what would make it a better way ?
a dash of mess .
let 's talk about social psychology .
actually , they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively .
they were complacent .
and they were full of doubt .
but we do n't feel that they 're helping us .
he disrupts their creative processes .
`` `` change instrument roles . '' ''
`` `` make a sudden , destructive , unpredictable action . incorporate . '' ''
just because you do n't like it does n't mean it is n't helping you .
know why ?
we really need some persuasion if we 're going to accept this .
thank you .
i 'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century .
in the 21st century , we need to actually look at — and what i 'm actually going to encourage you to consider today — is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count .
but i think it 's time for us to think about what we count .
this is van quach .
her first job was at an inner-city motel in san francisco as a maid .
i happened to buy that motel about three months after vivian started working there .
and this first hotel that i bought , motel , was a pay-by-the-hour , no-tell motel in the inner-city of san francisco .
it made me question and curious : how could someone actually find joy in cleaning toilets for a living ?
so i spent time with vivian , and i saw that she did n't find joy in cleaning toilets .
her job , her goal and her calling was not to become the world 's greatest toilet scrubber .
what counts for vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests .
well , not exactly , of course not .
`` we started eating `` '' freedom fries , '' '' and we started boycotting anything that was french . ''
`` we 're an american company . we 're based in san francisco . '' '' and i 'd get a terse response : `` '' oh , that 's worse . '' '' ( laughter ) so one particular day when i was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre , i ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices . ''
`` that 's where i got reacquainted with abraham maslow 's `` '' hierarchy of needs . '' '' i took one psychology class in college , and i learned about this guy , abraham maslow , as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs . ''
each of us , no matter what our role is in business , has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace .
and that 's what i did a few years ago when i took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turned it into what i call the transformation pyramid , which is survival , success and transformation .
and we started asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually addressing the higher needs , these transformational needs for our key employees in the company .
but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers , i realized we had no metrics .
so we started asking ourselves : what kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees ' sense of meaning , or our customers ' sense of emotional connection with us ?
we started asking our customers , did they feel an emotional connection with us , in one of seven different kinds of ways .
miraculously , as we asked these questions and started giving attention higher up the pyramid , what we found is we created more loyalty .
our customer loyalty skyrocketed .
our employee turnover dropped to one-third of the industry average , and during that five year dotcom bust , we tripled in size .
what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
they did n't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid .
if we 're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure , and all we can measure is the tangible in life , we 're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid .
so i went out and studied a bunch of things , and i found a survey that showed that 94 percent of business leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business , things like intellectual property , their corporate culture , their brand loyalty , and yet , only five percent of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business .
i flew off to a place that 's been shrouded in mystery for centuries , a place some folks call shangri-la .
at age 17 , he started asking the kinds of questions that you 'd expect of someone with a beginner 's mind .
the king responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later .
`` why do n't we care more about gross national happiness ? '' '' now , in essence , the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success , what has come to be known as gnh , or gross national happiness . ''
`` most world leaders did n't take notice , and those that did thought this was just `` '' buddhist economics . '' '' but the king was serious . ''
this was a notable moment , because this was the first time a world leader in almost 200 years had suggested that intangible of happiness — that leader 200 years ago , thomas jefferson with the declaration of independence — 200 years later , this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure , and it 's something we should actually value as government officials .
and i got to spend some time with the prime minister .
we create the conditions for happiness to occur .
it 's a good question . how do you feel about how you spend your time each day ?
and it focuses on something i read long ago from a guy named rabbi hyman schachtel .
how many know him ? anybody ?
the bhutanese are n't on some aspirational treadmill , constantly focused on what they do n't have .
( laughter ) the reality is , in western countries , quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out — an object that we 're supposed to get , or maybe many objects .
good question . but back to bhutan .
`` sarkozy suggested that world leaders should stop myopically focusing on gdp and consider a new index , what some french are calling a `` '' joie de vivre index . '' '' i like it . ''
so it suggests that the momentum is shifting .
this is a collection of things that robert kennedy said in that quote .
( applause ) certainly robert kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that .
so how do we do that ?
we 're spending 10 billion dollars on the census .
but all of those questions are tangible .
they 're about where you live , how many people you live with , and whether you own your home or not .
we 're not asking meaningful metrics .
we 're not asking important questions .
we 're not asking anything that 's intangible .
gdp has been our hammer .
so maybe it 's time that we get a bigger toolbox , right ?
maybe it 's time we get a toolbox that does n't just count what 's easily counted , the tangible in life , but actually counts what we most value , the things that are intangible .
i learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same .
they are n't the same .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
in vivian 's case , her unit of production is n't the tangible hours she works , it 's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work .
he stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years , and he 's loyal to the property because of the relationship that vivian and her fellow employees have created with him .
we do n't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits , we can have both .
so what the world needs now , in my opinion , is business leaders and political leaders who know what to count .
we count numbers .
we count on people .
what can you start counting today ?
( applause )
and the other was that i had access to good treatment .
depression is so exhausting .
i 'd also like to talk to you about palliative medicine : a paradigm of care for this population , grounded in what they value .
patient-centric care based on their values that helps this population live better and longer .
he had had headaches for about six weeks that got worse and worse and worse and worse .
evaluation revealed he had cancer that had spread to his brain .
i walked in , sat down , took harold 's hand , took his wife 's hand and just breathed .
he died a week later .
and it 's a conversation that had led us to crisis , to the biggest threat to the american way of life today , which is health care expenditures .
sixty percent of the gross domestic product of the united states of america — it has very little to do with health care at that point .
that does n't make sense .
former eastern bloc countries and sub-saharan african countries rank higher than us as far as quality and value .
so what are we going to do about this ?
and why is this so ?
how can we treat this without understanding this ?
we do things to this ; we need to do things for this .
two , improve the population health .
two : population health .
not because they could n't .
we maintained their value , their quality .
while harold 's time was limited , palliative care 's is not .
the hours , weeks , months , years , across a continuum — with treatment , without treatment .
meet christine .
stage iii cervical cancer , so , metastatic cancer that started in her cervix , spread throughout her body .
this is not just about the elderly , this is about people .
end-stage lung disease .
`` `` richard , what is it that you hold sacred ? '' ''
`` `` my kids , my wife and my harley . '' ''
`` ( laughter ) `` '' alright ! ''
he had this little voice telling him that maybe his time was weeks to months .
and we have met richard where richard 's at day-to-day .
it is for everyone .
jonathan is in his 20s , and i met him several years ago .
and do n't take my word for it .
a study done at harvard by friends of mine , colleagues .
they needed fewer hospitalizations .
and , ladies and gentlemen , they lived three to six months longer .
again , because we goofy , long white-coat physicians are trained and of the mantra of dealing with this , not with this .
what we know , what we have proven , is that this conversation needs to happen today — not next week , not next year .
palliative medicine is the answer to engage with human beings , to change the journey that we will all face , and change it for the better .
thank you very much .
things were going pretty well .
i went back to the left , and so slid the chair , blocking my path of travel .
now , i was officially freaking out .
just then , over my shout , i heard something else , a familiar rattle .
it sounded familiar , and i quickly considered another possibility , and i reached out with my left hand , as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy , and i came across an ear , the ear of a dog , perhaps a golden retriever .
its leash had been tied to the chair as her master went in for coffee , and she was just persistent in her efforts to greet me , perhaps get a scratch behind the ear .
who knows , maybe she was volunteering for service .
on st. patrick 's day of 2008 , i reported to the hospital for surgery to remove a brain tumor .
the surgery was successful .
two days later , my sight started to fail .
immediately , i was struck by an incredible sense of fear , of confusion , of vulnerability , like anybody would .
but as i had time to stop and think , i actually started to realize i had a lot to be grateful for .
in particular , i thought about my dad , who had passed away from complications from brain surgery .
and besides , it 's not like i was the first person ever to lose their sight .
i knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful , active life without sight .
so by the time i was discharged from the hospital a few days later , i left with a mission , a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as i could and get on to rebuilding my life .
within six months , i had returned to work .
i even started riding a tandem bike with my old cycling buddies , and was commuting to work on my own , walking through town and taking the bus .
these outsights ranged from the trival to the profound , from the mundane to the humorous .
as an architect , that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself .
paramount amongst those was the realization that , actually , cities are fantastic places for the blind .
similarly , just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space .
but also , the sense of smell .
some districts and cities have their own smell , as do places and things around you , and if you 're lucky , you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you 've been looking for .
all this really surprised me , because i started to realize that my unsighted experienced was so far more multi-sensory than my sighted experience ever was .
what struck me also was how much the city was changing around me .
when you 're sighted , everybody kind of sticks to themselves , you mind your own business .
lose your sight , though , and it 's a whole other story .
and i 'm not paranoid , but everywhere i go , i 'm getting all sorts of advice : go here , move there , watch out for this .
some of it 's helpful . a lot of it 's kind of reversed .
some of it 's kind of wrong and not helpful .
but one time i was in oakland walking along broadway , and came to a corner .
i was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal , and as it went off , i was just about to step out into the street , when all of a sudden , my right hand was just gripped by this guy , and he yanked my arm and pulled me out into the crosswalk and was dragging me out across the street , speaking to me in mandarin .
`` we do n't know you 're there , so it 's kind of nice to say `` '' hello '' '' first . ''
`` `` would you like some help ? '' ''
i liked it sighted . it was fine .
it 's a perfectly great city .
but once i lost my sight and was walking along broadway , i was blessed every block of the way .
`` `` god bless you . '' ''
often it 's thought that that 's an emotion that comes up out of pity .
i tend to think that it comes out of our shared humanity , out of our togetherness , and i think it 's pretty cool .
in fact , if i 'm feeling down , i just go to broadway in downtown oakland , i go for a walk , and i feel better like that , in no time at all .
but also that it illustrates how disability and blindness sort of cuts across ethnic , social , racial , economic lines .
in fact , i 've heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people : there are those with disabilities , and there are those that have n't quite found theirs yet .
so my final takeaway for you is that not only is the city good for the blind , but the city needs us .
and i 'm so sure of that that i want to propose to you today that the blind be taken as the prototypical city dwellers when imagining new and wonderful cities , and not the people that are thought about after the mold has already been cast .
it 's too late then .
the space between buildings will be well-balanced between people and cars .
in fact , cars , who needs them ?
there 'll be jobs , lots of jobs .
blind people want to work too .
so thank you .
the fate of microbes indoors depends on complex interactions with humans , and with the human-built environment .
and today , architects and biologists are working together to explore smart building design that will create healthy buildings for us .
we spend an extraordinary amount of time in buildings that are extremely controlled environments , like this building here — environments that have mechanical ventilation systems that include filtering , heating and air conditioning .
at the biology and the built environment center , we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the dna out of microbes in the air .
if you look at the x-axis of this graph , you 'll see that what we commonly want to do — which is keeping the outdoors out — we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation .
but being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
so to understand why this was the case , we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram , which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples .
and the first things that you can see from this graph is , if you look at the blue data points , which are the mechanically ventilated air , they 're not simply a subset of the green data points , which are the outdoor air .
it has microbes on it that are commonly associated with our skin and with our mouth , our spit .
and this is because we 're all constantly shedding microbes .
why does this matter ?
and the model that we 're working with in hospitals , and also with many , many different buildings , is to keep the outdoors out .
and this model may not necessarily be the best for our health .
so just as we manage national parks , where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others , we 're working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors .
and what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside .
thank you .
( applause )
they were gone in an instant .
i think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin .
but the parents in the room know that texting is actually the best way to communicate with your kids .
now the parents are really alarmed .
i know this because at dosomething.org , which is the largest organization for teenagers and social change in america , about six months ago we pivoted and started focusing on text messaging .
we 've also found an unintended consequence .
we 've been getting text messages back like these .
`` the boys call me faggot . '' '' `` `` i was cutting , my parents found out , and so i stopped . ''
`` but i just started again an hour ago . '' '' or , `` '' he wo n't stop raping me . ''
and yeah , we 're there .
because this is n't what we do .
we do social change .
kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them and there 's nowhere else to turn that they 're sending them to us .
so think about it , a text hotline ; it 's pretty powerful .
it 's fast , it 's pretty private .
no one hears you in a stall , you 're just texting quietly .
we can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals .
that 's great .
i want to prevent this shit from happening .
so think about a cop .
there 's something in new york city .
the police did it . it used to be just guess work , police work .
and so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things — charting the future essentially .
and they found things like , when you see crystal meth on the street , if you add police presence , you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen .
so think about the data from a crisis text line .
maybe there 's some studies , some longitudinal studies , that cost lots of money and took lots of time .
or maybe there 's some anecdotal evidence .
you could inform legislation .
`` you could say to a principal , `` '' you 're having a problem every thursday at three o'clock . ''
this is really , to me , the power of texting and the power of data .
i 'm here to show you how something you ca n't see can be so much fun to look at .
you 're about to experience a new , available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives .
what i have here is a cinder block that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
it 's called ultra-ever dry , and when you apply it to any material , it turns into a superhydrophobic shield .
not anymore .
superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface .
a freshly waxed car , the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees .
a windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees .
when you have nanotechnology and nanoscience , what 's occurred is that we 're able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits .
and we 're talking really small here .
the way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers , and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter , and to put some scale to that , if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick , and you put it side by side , and you had 50,000 of them , you 'd be the width of a human hair .
so very small , but very useful .
it 's a lot of water-based materials like concrete , water-based paint , mud , and also some refined oils as well .
it 's that afraid of the water .
and it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air .
i mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head .
the applications in a general sense could be anything that 's anti-wetting .
we 've certainly seen that today .
it could be anti-corrosion .
without water , the bacteria wo n't survive .
and i 'm going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small .
chris anderson : you guys did n't hear about us cutting out the design from ted ? ( laughter ) [ two minutes later ... ] he ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part .
it 's happening !
conscious but dazed by the blasts , you lay on your side and attempt to process what has just happened .
the image is terrifying , but you quickly come to understand it 's not real .
this vision continues to visit you multiple times a day and in your sleep .
can you see bfib ?
and during the day i would announce myself as i entered the room , careful not to startle or agitate him .
he lived out the remainder of his days isolated and tight-lipped , never finding a way to express himself , and i did n't yet have the tools to guide him .
and while i was pursuing my degree , a new war was raging , and thanks to modern body armor and military vehicles , service members were surviving blast injuries they would n't have before .
generation after generation of veterans have chosen not to talk about their experiences , and suffer in solitude .
now , i believed in art therapy , but i was going to have to convince service members , big , tough , strong , manly military men , and some women too , to give art-making as a psychotherapeutic intervention a try .
the results have been nothing short of spectacular .
vivid , symbolic artwork is being created by our servicemen and women , and every work of art tells a story .
we 've observed that the process of art therapy bypasses the speech-language issue with the brain .
service members can use the art-making to work through their experiences in a nonthreatening way .
they can then apply words to their physical creations , reintegrating the left and the right hemispheres of the brain .
now , we 've seen this can work with all forms of art — drawing , painting , collage — but what seems to have the most impact is mask-making .
every time he paints these disturbing images , he sees them less or not at all .
now science is showing us that the part of the brain that registers a traumatic wound can be the part of the brain where healing happens too .
and art therapy is showing us how to make that connection .
sorry .
melissa walker : over the past five years , we 've had over 1,000 masks made .
thank you .
people are n't close or distant .

would we see 544 airline pilots held captive in their jumbo jets on a runway for months , or a year ?
would we see 544 greyhound bus drivers ?
it would n't happen .
so i started to get intrigued .
and i discovered another fact , which to me was more astonishing almost for the fact that i had n't known it before at the age of 42 , 43 .
because perhaps the general public thinks of shipping as an old-fashioned industry , something brought by sailboat with moby dicks and jack sparrows .
shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been .
shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade .
we are more dependent on it now than ever .
now that sounds absurd in singapore to say that , because here shipping is so present that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel .
( laughter ) but elsewhere in the world , if you ask the general public what they know about shipping and how much trade is carried by sea , you will get essentially a blank face .
you will ask someone on the street if they 've heard of microsoft .
i should think they 'll say yes , because they 'll know that they make software that goes on computers , and occasionally works .
[ $ 60.2 billion ] now why is this ?
a few years ago , the first sea lord of the british admiralty — he is called the first sea lord , although the chief of the army is not called a land lord — he said that we , and he meant in the industrialized nations in the west , that we suffer from sea blindness .
it 's just something we fly over , a patch of blue on an airline map .
nothing to see , move along .
and it was a revelation .
we traveled through five seas , two oceans , nine ports , and i learned a lot about shipping .
and one of the first things that surprised me when i got on board kendal was , where are all the people ?
now that 's because shipping is very efficient .
ships have automation now .
they do n't have time to relax .
they 're at sea for months at a time , and even when they 're on board , they do n't have access to what a five-year-old would take for granted , the internet .
and another thing that surprised me when i got on board kendal was who i was sitting next to — not the queen ; i ca n't imagine why they put me underneath her portrait — but around that dining table in the officer 's saloon , i was sitting next to a burmese guy , i was opposite a romanian , a moldavian , an indian .
on the next table was a chinese guy , and in the crew room , it was entirely filipinos .
ships can now fly the flag of any nation that provides a flag registry .
( laughter ) so we have these very multinational , global , mobile crews on ships .
and that was also shocking , because suddenly , i realized , as the captain said to me , that i had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship .
there were double pirate watches .
what else does our sea blindness mask ?
well , if you go out to sea on a ship or on a cruise ship , and look up to the funnel , you 'll see very black smoke .
and that 's because shipping has very tight margins , and they want cheap fuel , so they use something called bunker fuel , which was described to me by someone in the tanker industry as the dregs of the refinery , or just one step up from asphalt .
in terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile , it emits about a thousandth of aviation and about a tenth of trucking .
and if you put shipping emissions on a list of the countries ' carbon emissions , it would come in about sixth , somewhere near germany .
there are interesting initiatives going on .
i also traveled to cape cod to look at the plight of the north atlantic right whale , because this to me was one of the most surprising things about my time at sea , and what it made me think about .
and in fact , shipping has a role to play here , because shipping noise has contributed to damaging the acoustic habitats of ocean creatures .
light does n't penetrate beneath the surface of the water , so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins and even 800 species of fish communicate by sound .
and a north atlantic right whale can transmit across hundreds of miles .
a humpback can transmit a sound across a whole ocean .
and the acoustic habitat of the north atlantic right whale has been reduced by up to 90 percent .
and when i arrived in singapore , and i apologize for this , but i did n't want to get off my ship .
i 'd really loved being on board kendal .
i 'd been well treated by the crew , i 'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain , and i would happily have signed up for another five weeks , something that the captain also said i was crazy to think about .
but when i get to this part , i 'm in two minds , because i want to salute those seafarers who bring us 90 percent of everything and get very little thanks or recognition for it .
but i also want to see shipping , and us , the general public , who know so little about it , to have a bit more scrutiny , to be a bit more transparent , to have 90 percent transparency .
because i think we could all benefit from doing something very simple , which is learning to see the sea .
thank you .
for me , it 's a very , very important thing .
wow , what an honor . i always wondered what this would feel like .
i wanted to have some type of impact . it did n't matter what it was .
it was that i would ask one simple question .
and next , what 's our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions ?
and then the next step is our experiences .
you know , before this , a passion could come and hit you in the face , or maybe in your possible line of work , you might throw it away because you do n't have a way of identifying it .
`` and live your legend and the movement we 've built would n't exist if i did n't have this compass to identify , `` wow , this is something i want to pursue and make a difference with . '' ''
i swear there 's something in there .
and my guess is some people in this room might have done that before .
`` and he says , `` '' scott , hey man , what 's the worst that could happen ? ''
you 're wearing a wetsuit . you 're not going to sink .
`` plus , if there 's a shark attack , why are they going to pick you over the 80 people in the water ? '' '' so thanks , that helps . ''
think how you would have approached your world differently if at nine years old you found out you could swim a mile and a half in 56-degree water from alcatraz to san francisco .
and he 's just flailing like this .
this was not fatigue .
there 's this quote by jim rohn and it says .
they change everything , and it 's a proven fact .
the people change everything , and this is why — you know , you ask what was going on .
and then i 'm over here in san francisco , and everyone around me was doing it .
they are 100 percent in our control .
no one can tell you you ca n't learn about yourself .
and the thing is , it 's starting to happen on a widespread level .
and that 's already starting to happen .
we have to do our work on ourself , be intentional about that , and make those discoveries .
what would that look like ?
and as we finish up , i have just one question to ask you guys , and i think it 's the only question that matters .
and it 's what is the work you ca n't not do ?
discover that , live it , not just for you , but for everybody around you , because that is what starts to change the world .
thank you guys .
`` they say , `` '' it 's okay , we 'll email you . '' '' ( laughter ) i ca n't even get a coffee date at starbucks . ''
`` my husband 's like , `` '' honey , deception ? ''
and they start up that path by accepting a core proposition , and that proposition is the following : lying is a cooperative act .
sometimes we 're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity , maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret , secret .
`` or we say , favorite of the digiratti , `` '' you know , i just fished that email out of my spam folder . ''
deception is actually serious business .
this con man , henry oberlander , he was such an effective con man , british authorities say he could have undermined the entire banking system of the western world .
we wish we were better husbands , better wives , smarter , more powerful , taller , richer — the list goes on .
lying is an attempt to bridge that gap , to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were , how we wish we could be , with what we 're really like .
now granted , many of those are white lies .
but in another study , it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .
we 're essentially against lying .
but if you look more closely , the plot actually thickens .
if you 're an average married couple , you 're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions .
now , you may think that 's bad .
if you 're unmarried , that number drops to three .
we parse it out on an as-needed basis , sometimes for very good reasons , other times just because we do n't understand the gaps in our lives .
now you might remember koko .
does anybody remember koko the gorilla who was taught sign language ?
it 's her cute little , fluffy pet kitten .
koko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall .
( laughter ) we 're hardwired to become leaders of the pack .
how early ?
well babies will fake a cry , pause , wait to see who 's coming and then go right back to crying .
( laughter ) two-year-olds bluff .
five-year-olds lie outright .
they manipulate via flattery .
nine-year-olds , masters of the cover-up .
trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time .
the rest of us , we 're only 54 percent accurate .
why is it so easy to learn ?
there are good liars and bad liars .
and these allegations are false .
and i need to go back to work for the american people .
well first we heard what 's known as a non-contracted denial .
`` freud said , look , there 's much more to it than speech : `` '' no mortal can keep a secret . ''
`` if his lips are silent , he chatters with his fingertips . '' '' and we all do it no matter how powerful you are . ''
( laughter ) now this brings us to our next pattern , which is body language .
let the science temper your knowledge a little bit .
but a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away .
they can not be consciously contracted , especially if you overdid the botox .
`` we say `` '' yes , '' '' we shake our heads `` '' no . '' '' we tell very convincing stories , we slightly shrug our shoulders . ''
we 're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test .
happy to take a paternity test , and would love to see it happen .
but i 'm happy to participate in one .
murderers are known to leak sadness .
it 's associated with moral superiority .
it 's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in .
now here 's the deal .
these behaviors are just behaviors .
they 're not proof of deception .
they 're red flags .
and you 'll see when you see the video , she ca n't even pretend to be an agonizing mother .
and she fought , and i know she fought you .
but i know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes , and you still wanted to kill her .
and i do n't understand it , and i never will .
and these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit , and they will prove incredibly useful some day .
`` they know , as someone once said , `` character 's who you are in the dark . '' ''
and what 's kind of interesting is that today , we have so little darkness .
our world is lit up 24 hours a day .
so one challenge we have is to remember , oversharing , that 's not honesty .
and that 's the truth . thank you .
he was the ultimate deconstructer , in many ways .
it represents hope . it represents potential .
she wants to , you know , find obi wan kenobi . he 's her only hope .
because it is now democratized . so now , the creation of media is — it 's everywhere .
tom 's hand . tom 's hand . tom 's hand . ( laughter ) anyway .
my dear fellow citizen : i write to you today , to you who have lost in this era .
`` at this moment in our common life , when the world is full of breaking and spite and fear , i address this letter simply to you , even though we both know there are many of you behind this `` '' you , '' '' and many of me behind this `` '' i . '' '' i write to you because at present , this quaking world we share scares me . ''
some of what we fear , i suspect , we fear in common .
but much of what we fear seems to be each other .
you fear the world i want to live in , and i fear your visions in turn .
i did notice the barren shops in wagner , south dakota , and the vfw gathering hall that stood in mockery of a community 's dream to endure . i did notice
i did notice the news about those parts of london becoming ghost quarters , where the global super-rich turn fishy money into empty apartments and price lifelong residents of a city , young couples starting out , out of their own home .
you used to be able to count on work , and now you could n't .
i heard all of these things , but i did n't listen .
i looked but did n't see .
i read , did n't understand .
i listened only when you moved toward shattering continental unions and electing vulgar demagogues .
only then did your pain become of interest to me .
i wonder now if you would be less eager to deal it if i had stood with you when you merely felt it .
i now see as i did n't before that not having the right skin or right organ is not the only varietal of disadvantage .
it is for you to learn to live in a new century in which there are no bonuses for showing up with the right skin and right organs .
but i will admit , fellow citizen , that i have discounted the burden of coping with the loss of status .
i have forgotten that what is socially necessary can also be personally gruelling .
just as i can not and do n't wish to turn back to the clock on equality and diversity , and yet must understand the sense of loss they can inspire , so , too , i refuse and could not if i wished turn back the clock on an ever more closely knit , interdependent world , and on inventions that wo n't stop being invented .
you have for years been telling me that your experience of these things is not as good as my theories forecast .
yet before you could finish a complaining sentence about the difficulty of living with erratic hours , volatile pay , vanishing opportunities , about the pain of dropping your children off at 24-hour day care to make your 3am shift , i shot back at you — before you could finish your sentence — my dogma , about how what you are actually experiencing was flexibility and freedom .
i have condescended to you with the idea that you are voting against your economic interests — voting against your interests , as if i know your interests .
that is just my dogmatic economism talking .
i have a weakness for treating people 's economic interests as their only interest , ignoring things like belonging and pride and the desire to send a message to those who ignore you .
so here we are , in a scary but not inexplicable moment of demagoguery , fracture , xenophobia , resentment and fear .
and i worry for us both if we continue down this road , me not listening , you feeling unheard , you shouting to get me to listen .
if this goes on , if this goes on , there may be blood .
there is always the hope of redemption .
you were not born vengeful .
we face a problem of your and my relations .
we chose ways of relating to each other that got us here .
we can do this only if we first accept that we have neglected each other .
if there is hope to summon in this ominous hour , it is this .
sincerely yours , a fellow citizen .
so here are four different teas that we 've tested .
do you recommend pursuing these treatments now , for most cancer patients ?
( applause ) thank you . thank you very much . thank you .
♫ my limbs , they are supple and soft . ♫ ♫ it is written for me in the stars , ♫ ♫ thou shalt kiss , thou shalt love . ♫ ♫ my feet , they glide and float , ♫ ♫ my eyes , they lure and glow . ♫ ♫ and i dance as if entranced , 'cause i know , ♫ ♫ my lips give so fiery a kiss . ♫ ♫ in my veins , ♫ ♫ runs a dancer 's blood , ♫ ♫ because my beautiful mother ♫ ♫ was the queen of dance ♫ ♫ in the gilded alcazar . ♫ ♫ she was so very beautiful , ♫ ♫ i often saw her in my dreams . ♫

for apple 's customers , this is a great thing .
but governments are not so happy .
you see , apple has made a conscious decision to get out of the surveillance business .
in contrast , the security of android just really is n't as good .
apple is a seller of luxury goods .
it dominates the high end of the market .
and we would expect a manufacturer of luxury goods to have products that include more features .
but not everyone can afford an iphone .
this is a problem .
we must remember that surveillance is a tool .
and it 's not just a privacy or a cybersecurity problem .
this is actually a problem for our democracy .
modern social movements rely on technology — from black lives matter to the arab spring to occupy wall street .
and so , naturally governments that feel threatened by these movements will also target the organizers and their smartphones .
but chances are , they 'll probably have a cheap , $ 20 android phone in their pocket .
it 's really terrifying .
hw : wow . thank you so much . cs : thank you .
hw : thanks , chris .
mobility in developing world cities is a very peculiar challenge , because different from health or education or housing , it tends to get worse as societies become richer .
mobility , as most other developing country problems , more than a matter of money or technology , is a matter of equality , equity .
the great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see , for example , that in terms of transport , an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars , but rather one where even the rich use public transport .
there is a conflict for space between those with cars and those without them .
however , there is a problem with that , that market economy needs inequality of income in order to work .
some people must make more money , some others less .
some companies succeed . others fail .
then what kind of equality can we hope for today with a market economy ?
i would propose two kinds which both have much to do with cities .
`` and the second kind of equality is one which we could call `` '' democratic equality . '' '' the first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law . ''
that is not just poetry .
for example , if that is true , a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one .
we have been so used to inequality , sometimes , that it 's before our noses and we do not see it .
they also have great capacity .
we fought not just for space for buses , but we fought for space for people , and that was even more difficult .
just as fish need to swim or birds need to fly or deer need to run , we need to walk .
there is a really enormous conflict , when we are talking about developing country cities , between pedestrians and cars .
here , what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy .
what this shows is that people who walk are third-class citizens while those who go in cars are first-class citizens .
in terms of transport infrastructure , what really makes a difference between advanced and backward cities is not highways or subways but quality sidewalks .
here they made a flyover , probably very useless , and they forgot to make a sidewalk .
in my city of bogotá , we fought a very difficult battle in order to take space from cars , which had been parking on sidewalks for decades , in order to make space for people that should reflect dignity of human beings , and to make space for protected bikeways .
indeed , a very important ideological and political issue anywhere is how to distribute that most valuable resource of a city , which is road space .
this is not a technological issue , and we should remember that in no constitution parking is a constitutional right when we make that distribution .
we also built , and this was 15 years ago , before there were bikeways in new york or in paris or in london , it was a very difficult battle as well , more than 350 kilometers of protected bicycle ways .
i do n't think protected bicycle ways are a cute architectural feature .
they are a right , just as sidewalks are , unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility , without the risk of getting killed .
in the united states , for example , more than 70 million new homes must be built over the next 40 or 50 years .
we have had cities for 8,000 years , and children could walk out of home and play .
they completely changed cities .
only in 1925 , almost 7,000 children were killed by cars in the united states .
i will propose to you a couple of ingredients which i think would make cities much better , and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created .
children will walk out of homes into safe spaces .
they could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways , sort of bicycle highways , and i would invite you to imagine the following : a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians and bicycles .
in new cities which are going to be built , this would not be particularly difficult .
when i was mayor of bogotá , in only three years , we were able to create 70 kilometers , in one of the most dense cities in the world , of these bicycle highways .
and this changes the way people live , move , enjoy the city .
but what do we do first ?
but you see , when a city is only being created , it 's very easy to incorporate this kind of infrastructure .
then the city grows around it .
and of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it , and it changes the way of life .
this would be , again , a very low-cost solution if implemented from the start , low cost , pleasant transit with natural sunlight .
but unfortunately , reality is not as good as my dreams .
in my country of colombia , almost half the homes in cities initially were illegal developments .
but even legal developments have also been located in the wrong places , very far from the city centers where it 's impossible to provide low-cost , high-frequency public transport .
as a latin american , and latin america was the most recently organized region in the world , i would recommend , respectfully , passionately , to those countries which are yet to urbanize — latin america went from 40 percent urban in 1950 to 80 percent urban in 2010 — i would recommend asian and african countries which are yet to urbanize , such as india which is only 33 percent urban now , that governments should acquire all land around cities .
in this way , their cities could grow in the right places with the right spaces , with the parks , with the greenways , with the busways .
what a fantastic opportunity for leaders and many young leaders to come , especially in the developing countries .
i am sure , i am optimistic , that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams .
( applause )
and i think it starts with one physician , and that 's me .
hey , why not ?
we 're near the end , we 're getting close to the world series .
we all love baseball , do n't we ?
it 's called batting average .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
that means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
three times out of 10 .
do you know what they call a 300 hitter in major league baseball ?
good , really good , maybe an all-star .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter ?
suppose you have appendicitis and you 're referred to a surgeon who 's batting 400 on appendectomies .
( laughter ) somehow this is n't working out , is it ?
but , but , you know what ?
and she 's hitting a 257 .
somehow this is n't working .
1,000 , very good .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that 's going to happen .
i was an obsessive compulsive student .
i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis .
and to report back to my attending .
and when i listened to her , she was making a wheezy sound .
i gave her medications that we call diuretics , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
and he knew her , he would have been able to furnish additional information about her .
maybe i did n't want to be a high-maintenance resident .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending 's patients without even having to contact him .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
`` and the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly , `` '' yeah , i think she 'll do okay . '' '' i can remember that like it was yesterday . ''
and i went back to my work on the wards .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach .
and at the end of the day , i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i do n't usually do .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
the three words are : do you remember ?
she was back and near death .
and the emerg . staff pulled out all the stops .
they put her on a ventilator .
and i was shocked and shaken to the core .
and i went through this roller coaster , because after they stabilized her , she went to the intensive care unit , and i hoped against hope that she would recover .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
and the family gathered .
and that was my first time to be acquainted with that .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine — where i felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you ca n't talk about it with your colleagues .
the unhealthy shame i 'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
and it was n't because of my attending ; he was a doll .
why did i go into medicine ?
and i made myself a bargain that if only i redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
he was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days .
and i went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
( laughter ) some of my doozies have been in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and unsupported .
that 's the system that we have .
it 's a complete denial of mistakes .
in this country , as many as 24,000 canadians die of preventable medical errors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine pegged it at 100,000 .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we ca n't keep up with it .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and weed out all the error-prone health professionals , well there wo n't be anybody left .
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
she 's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
i am a redefined physician .
i 'm human . i make mistakes .
( applause )
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
we delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on .
now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it .
so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
however , there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor , rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it 's too late .
but frustratingly , with parkinson 's disease and other movement disorders , there are no biomarkers , so there 's no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test .
you have to go to the clinic to do it . it 's very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it 's just never done . it 's never done .
so what i want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtuosos like my friend jan stripling .
i mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates , and just as the limbs are affected in parkinson 's , so too are the vocal organs .
we see all the same symptoms .
we see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity .
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
so these voice-based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we 'll , they 're both non-invasive .
you do n't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
that means they can be self-administered .
they 're high-speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup .
we can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it 's too late .
what are you going to get out of those samples ?
but we 'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it 's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
ml : it 's much better than that .
actually , my student thanasis , i have to plug him , because he 's done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we 're getting 99 percent accuracy .
so what that means is that people will be able to — ml : ( laughs ) tr : people will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with parkinson 's could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they 're doing in this course of the disease .
ml : thanks , tom . ( applause )
but darwin does n't only explain the evolution of a single idea .
it has no water . it has no energy , no resources .
on my desk in my office , i keep a small clay pot that i made in college . it 's raku , which is a kind of pottery that began in japan centuries ago as a way of making bowls for the japanese tea ceremony .
this one is more than 400 years old .
everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire .
but here in the united states , we ramp up the drama a little bit , and we drop our pots into sawdust , which catches on fire , and you take a garbage pail , and you put it on top , and smoke starts pouring out .
i would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke .
raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity .
when i sat down to write a book about creativity , i realized that the steps were reversed .
i had to let go at the very beginning , and i had to immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists and writers and musicians and filmmakers , and as i listened to these stories , i realized that creativity grows out of everyday experiences more often than you might think , including letting go .
`` the first embrace is something that we think , `` '' oh , this is very easy , '' '' but it 's actually getting harder , and that 's paying attention to the world around us . ''
so many artists speak about needing to be open , to embrace experience , and that 's hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that takes all of your focus .
the filmmaker mira nair speaks about growing up in a small town in india . its name is bhubaneswar , and here 's a picture of one of the temples in her town .
we played cricket all the time . we kind of grew up in the rubble . the major thing that inspired me , that led me on this path , that made me a filmmaker eventually , was traveling folk theater that would come through the town and i would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of , you know , passion , and hashish as well , and it was amazing .
you know , the folk tales of mahabharata and ramayana , the two holy books , the epics that everything comes out of in india , they say . after seeing that jatra , the folk theater , i knew i wanted to get on , you know , and perform .
julie burstein : is n't that a wonderful story ?
you can see the sort of break in the everyday .
the novelist richard ford speaks about a childhood challenge that continues to be something he wrestles with today . he 's severely dyslexic .
what words look like , where paragraphs break , where lines break . i mean , i was n't so badly dyslexic that i was disabled from reading . i just had to do it really slowly , and as i did , lingering on those sentences as i had to linger , i fell heir to language 's other qualities , which i think has helped me write sentences .
he had to learn from it . he had to learn to hear the music in language .
artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do , sometimes pushing into what they ca n't do , helps them focus on finding their own voice .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how , as a young artist , he thought he was a painter , and he lived in florence after graduate school .
while he was there , he traveled to madrid , where he went to the prado to see this picture by the spanish painter diego velázquez .
`` it 's from 1656 , and it 's called `` '' las meninas , '' '' and it 's the picture of a little princess and her ladies-in-waiting , and if you look over that little blonde princess 's shoulder , you 'll see a mirror , and reflected in it are her parents , the king and queen of spain , who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture . ''
`` richard serra : i was standing there looking at it , and i realized that velázquez was looking at me , and i thought , `` '' oh . i 'm the subject of the painting . '' '' and i thought , `` '' i 'm not going to be able to do that painting . '' '' i was to the point where i was using a stopwatch and painting squares out of randomness , and i was n't getting anywhere . so i went back and dumped all my paintings in the arno , and i thought , i 'm going to just start playing around . ''
`` richard serra let go of painting at that moment , but he did n't let go of art . he moved to new york city , and he put together a list of verbs — to roll , to crease , to fold — more than a hundred of them , and as he said , he just started playing around . he did these things to all kinds of material . he would take a huge sheet of lead and roll it up and unroll it . he would do the same thing to rubber , and when he got to the direction `` '' to lift , '' '' he created this , which is in the museum of modern art . ''
that 's a tough space to stand in .
you know where this story goes .
`` joel meyerowitz : and like all the other passersby , i stood outside the chain link fence on chambers and greenwich , and all i could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble , and i raised my camera to take a peek , just to see if there was something to see , and some cop , a lady cop , hit me on my shoulder , and said , `` '' hey , no pictures ! '' '' and it was such a blow that it woke me up , in the way that it was meant to be , i guess . ''
`` and when i asked her why no pictures , she said , `` it 's a crime scene . no photographs allowed . '' ''
`` i 'll find a way to get in , because i do n't want to see this history disappear . '' '' jb : he did . he pulled in every favor he could , and got a pass into the world trade center site , where he photographed for nine months almost every day . ''
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when i went home to my family at night .
my office was just a few blocks away .
but some of these photographs are beautiful , and we wondered , was it difficult for joel meyerowitz to make such beauty out of such devastation ?
jm : well , you know , ugly , i mean , powerful and tragic and horrific and everything , but it was also as , in nature , an enormous event that was transformed after the fact into this residue , and like many other ruins — you go to the ruins of the colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace — and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather .
it gets further and further away from the day , and light and seasons temper it in some way , and it 's not that i 'm a romantic . i 'm really a realist .
jb : you have to take a picture . that sense of urgency , of the need to get to work , is so powerful in joel 's story .
`` when i saw joel meyerowitz recently , i told him how much i admired his passionate obstinacy , his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work , and he laughed , and he said , `` '' i 'm stubborn , but i think what 's more important is my passionate optimism . '' '' the first time i told these stories , a man in the audience raised his hand and said , `` '' all these artists talk about their work , not their art , which has got me thinking about my work and where the creativity is there , and i 'm not an artist . '' '' he 's right . we all wrestle with experience and challenge , limits and loss . ''
creativity is essential to all of us , whether we 're scientists or teachers , parents or entrepreneurs .
it 's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it .
but the person who put it back together , instead of hiding the cracks , decided to emphasize them , using gold lacquer to repair it .
thank you . ( applause )
we all have our own inner movie , you and you and you .
`` ( music : george frideric handel , `` '' allegro . '' '' performed by daria van den bercken . ) ( video ) daria van den bercken : i live there on the third floor . ''
i actually live there , around the corner .
and you 'd be really welcome .
man : ( in dutch ) does that sound like fun ? child : ( in dutch ) yes !
chris anderson : elon , what kind of crazy dream would persuade you to think of trying to take on the auto industry and build an all-electric car ?
elon musk : well , it goes back to when i was in university .
i think it 's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production .
that sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century , independent of environmental concerns .
in fact , even if producing co2 was good for the environment , given that we 're going to run out of hydrocarbons , we need to find some sustainable means of operating .
how can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help ?
em : right . there 's two elements to that answer .
one is that , even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars , you 're still better off .
and the reason is , in the stationary power plant , you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more , is voluminous , and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source .
so in effect , even after you 've taken transmission loss into account and everything , even using the same source fuel , you 're at least twice as better off charging an electric car , then burning it at the power plant .
em : yes , it does .
ca : so we 've got some video here of the tesla being assembled , which , if we could play that first video — so what is innovative about this process in this vehicle ?
em : sure . so , in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport , and i should say that i think , actually , all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets .
there 's just no way around newton 's third law .
the question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport ?
in fact , we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack .
and in fact , customers of the model s are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range .
ca : bruno bowden , who 's here , did that , broke the world record.em : congratulations .
what is the most surprising thing about the experience of driving the car ?
you ca n't do that with a gasoline car .
is there a road map where this becomes a mass-market vehicle ?
then we 've got the model s , which starts at around 50,000 dollars .
but whenever you 've got really new technology , it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass-market product .
there is n't a huge nationwide network of charging stations now that are fast .
em : there actually are far more charging stations than people realize , and at tesla we developed something called a supercharging technology , and we 're offering that if you buy a model s for free , forever .
we actually have california and nevada covered , and we 've got the eastern seaboard from boston to d.c. covered .
by the end of this year , you 'll be able to drive from l.a. to new york just using the supercharger network , which charges at five times the rate of anything else .
so if you drive for three hours , you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes , because that 's normally what people will stop for .
so it 's common — do n't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes .
you 've been working on this solar company solarcity .
what most people know but do n't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already .
if the sun was n't there , we 'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees kelvin , and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation .
the whole ecosystem is solar-powered .
( applause ) ca : how ?
ca : but you 're not selling solar panels to consumers .
em : no , we actually are . you can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system .
most people choose to lease .
and the thing about solar power is that it does n't have any feed stock or operational costs , so once it 's installed , it 's just there .
and we 've made huge progress in that direction , and that 's why i 'm confident we 'll actually beat natural gas .
ca : so your current proposition to consumers is , do n't pay so much up front .
we will install panels on your roof .
it 's no money down , and your utility bill decreases .
no risk , you 'll pay less than you 're paying now .
google is one of our big partners here .
and they have an expected return on that capital .
em : exactly . what it amounts to is a giant distributed utility .
ca : and you really picture a future where a majority of power in america , within a decade or two , or within your lifetime , it goes solar ?
em : i 'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power , and most likely a majority , and i predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years .
em : more from solar than any other source .
( laughter ) em : i got that question a lot , that 's true .
`` people would say , `` '' did you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry ? '' '' obviously , `` '' he started with a large one , '' '' is the punchline . ''
`` and they 'd look at me , like , `` '' is he serious ? '' '' ca : and strangely , you were . so what happened ? ''
we came very close to failure , but we managed to get through that point in 2008 .
ca : would humanity become a space-faring civilization ?
so that was a dream of yours , in a way , from a young age ?
you 've dreamed of mars and beyond ?
em : i did build rockets when i was a kid , but i did n't think i 'd be involved in this .
ca : so you 've somehow slashed the cost of building a rocket by 75 percent , depending on how you calculate it .
nasa has been doing this for years . how have you done this ?
there 's a long list of innovations that we 've come up with there that are a little difficult to communicate in this talk , but — ca : not least because you could still get copied , right ?
you have n't patented this stuff . it 's really interesting to me .
em : absolutely . so the thing about rockets is that they 're all expendable .
all rockets that fly today are fully expendable .
the space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket , but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time , and the parts that were reusable took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight .
obviously that does n't work very well for — ca : what just happened there ? we just saw something land ?
ca : wow . reusable rockets.em : yes . ( applause ) and so what a lot of people do n't realize is , the cost of the fuel , of the propellant , is very small .
it 's much like on a jet .
so the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent of the cost of the rocket .
every mode of transport that we use , whether it 's planes , trains , automobiles , bikes , horses , is reusable , but not rockets .
so we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization .
ca : definitely more expensive .
you 'd like to see a colony on mars .
em : yeah , exactly . spacex , or some combination of companies and governments , needs to make progress in the direction of making life multi-planetary , of establishing a base on another planet , on mars — being the only realistic option — and then building that base up until we 're a true multi-planet species .
`` ca : so progress on this `` '' let 's make it reusable , '' '' how is that going ? that was just a simulation video we saw . ''
how 's it going ?
em : we 're actually , we 've been making some good progress recently with something we call the grasshopper test project , where we 're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight , the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky .
and we 've had some good tests .
so that 's just to give a sense of scale .
we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket . ( laughter ) ca : all right , let 's see that video then , because this is actually amazing when you think about it .
you 've never seen this before . a rocket blasting off and then — em : yeah , so that rocket is about the size of a 12-story building .
these projects are so — paypal , solarcity , tesla , spacex , they 're so spectacularly different , they 're such ambitious projects at scale .
what is it about you ?
i work a lot . i mean , a lot .
ca : well , i have a theory.em : okay . all right .
ca : my theory is that you have an ability to think at a system level of design that pulls together design , technology and business , so if ted was tbd , design , technology and business , into one package , synthesize it in a way that very few people can and — and this is the critical thing — feel so damn confident in that clicked-together package that you take crazy risks .
you bet your fortune on it , and you seem to have done that multiple times .
can we put it into our education system ? can someone learn from you ?
em : well , thanks . thank you .
it is physics . you know , the sort of first principles reasoning .
generally i think there are — what i mean by that is , boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there , as opposed to reasoning by analogy .
through most of our life , we get through life by reasoning by analogy , which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations .
and you have to do that .
otherwise , mentally , you would n't be able to get through the day .
so i think that 's an important thing to do , and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback , and solicit it , particularly from friends .
this may sound like simple advice , but hardly anyone does that , and it 's incredibly helpful .
learn from this man .
elon musk , i wish we had all day , but thank you so much for coming to ted .
em : thank you . ca : that was awesome . that was really , really cool .
thank you so much .
this is one of my favorite clips of rosie .
unfortunately , all his spinosaurus bones were destroyed in world war ii .
but that was pretty much all we knew about this animal for the next 100 years .
it 's a difficult place to work in .
we discovered many incredible specimens .
but the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton .
again , this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water , it 's useful for buoyancy control in the water .
as we design these things , we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds , and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems .
the microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath , or not , and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems interact with ecosystems on everything we touch .
`` i get asked all of the time from people , `` is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems ? '' ''
i 'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how , through both conscious and unconscious design , we 're impacting these invisible worlds .
this is the lillis business complex at the university of oregon , and i worked with a team of architects and biologists to sample over 300 rooms in this building .
we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building , and to do this , we sampled dust .
this means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project .
`` this is a picture of tim , who , right when i snapped this picture , reminded me , he said , `` '' jessica , the last lab group i worked in i was doing fieldwork in the costa rican rainforest , and things have changed dramatically for me . '' '' so i 'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices , and we 're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that i 've been working on in partnership with autodesk . ''
the way that you look at this data is , first , look around the outside of the circle .
you 'll see broad bacterial groups , and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe , it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group .
so at 12 o'clock , you 'll see that offices have a lot of alphaproteobacteria , and at one o'clock you 'll see that bacilli are relatively rare .
let 's take a look at what 's going on in different space types in this building .
we know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air .
so the very first thing we wanted to do in this building was look at the air system .
and if you compare this to the microbes in a different air handling unit , you 'll see that they 're fundamentally different .
another facet of how microbes get around is by people , and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people , or the sharing of ideas , like in labs and in offices .
given that microbes travel around with people , you might expect to see rooms that are close together have really similar biomes .
and that is exactly what we found .
if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another , they have very similar ecosystems , but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away , the ecosystem is fundamentally different .
and when i see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns , it makes me think that it 's possible to tackle really challenging problems , like hospital-acquired infections .
i believe this has got to be , in part , a building ecology problem .
i am collaborating with charlie brown .
he 's dedicated his life to sustainable design .
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building , he got really excited , because it added a new dimension to what he did .
so what i 'm first going to show you is air that we sampled outside of the building .
a lot of buildings are operated this way , probably where you work , and companies do this to save money on their energy bill .
what we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until saturday , when we opened the vents up again .
when you walked into those rooms , they smelled really bad , and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before .
contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers .
he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident microbial landscape .
would n't it be awesome if we all had blis on our phones ?
thank you .
and we have taken pictures like this .
and so it 's been tectonically altered .
this is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane .
and there is a lake scene in the south polar region of titan .
moreover , this whole , entire region , the south polar region , has elevated temperatures . it 's the hottest place on the planet , on the body .
so we have , possibly , liquid water , organic materials and excess heat .
( applause )
for me , this story begins about 15 years ago , when i was a hospice doctor at the university of chicago .
`` and in my lab , i was studying the widower effect , which is a very old idea in the social sciences , going back 150 years , known as `` '' dying of a broken heart . '' '' so , when i die , my wife 's risk of death can double , for instance , in the first year . ''
and i had gone to take care of one particular patient , a woman who was dying of dementia .
and in this case , unlike this couple , she was being cared for by her daughter .
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother .
and the daughter 's husband , he also was sick from his wife 's exhaustion .
and i was driving home one day , and i get a phone call from the husband 's friend , calling me because he was depressed about what was happening to his friend .
so here i get this call from this random guy that 's having an experience that 's being influenced by people at some social distance .
and so i suddenly realized two very simple things : first , the widowhood effect was not restricted to husbands and wives .
and i started to see the world in a whole new way , like pairs of people connected to each other .
and then , in fact , these people were embedded in other sorts of relationships : marriage and spousal and friendship and other sorts of ties .
why are we embedded in social networks ?
and how do they effect us ?
so my first topic with respect to this , was not death , but obesity .
`` it had become trendy to speak about the `` '' obesity epidemic . '' '' and , along with my collaborator , james fowler , we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic and could it spread from person to person like the four people i discussed earlier . ''
it 's 2,200 people in the year 2000 .
in addition , some questions are immediately raised : how much clustering is there ?
is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone ?
how big are the clusters ? how far do they reach ?
and , most importantly , what causes the clusters ?
this here shows , on the y-axis , the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and , on the x-axis , the degrees of separation between the two people .
on the far left , you see the purple line .
and the last possibility is what is known as confounding , because it confounds our ability to figure out what 's going on .
and here , the idea is not that my weight gain is causing your weight gain , nor that i preferentially form a tie with you because you and i share the same body size , but rather that we share a common exposure to something , like a health club that makes us both lose weight at the same time .
when we studied these data , we found evidence for all of these things , including for induction .
and we found that if your friend becomes obese , it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent in the same given time period .
`` there can be many mechanisms for this effect : one possibility is that your friends say to you something like — you know , they adopt a behavior that spreads to you — like , they say , `` '' let 's go have muffins and beer , '' '' which is a terrible combination . ( laughter ) but you adopt that combination , and then you start gaining weight like them . ''
another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight , and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is .
now , headline writers had a field day with our studies .
`` i think the headline in the new york times was , `` '' are you packing it on ? ''
`` and we thought this was a very interesting comment on america , and a kind of self-serving , `` '' not my responsibility '' '' kind of phenomenon . ''
now , i want to be very clear : we do not think our work should or could justify prejudice against people of one or another body size at all .
our next questions was : could we actually visualize this spread ?
was weight gain in one person actually spreading to weight gain in another person ?
and this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure , the architecture of the ties , was changing across time .
lots of people are doing things at the same time .
every tie between them is a relationship .
the dot sizes are going to grow , you 're going to see a sea of yellow take over .
you 're going to see people be born and die — dots will appear and disappear — ties will form and break , marriages and divorces , friendings and defriendings .
a lot of complexity , a lot is happening just in this 30-year period that includes the obesity epidemic .
and , by the end , you 're going to see clusters of obese and non-obese individuals within the network .
now , when looked at this , it changed the way i see things , because this thing , this network that 's changing across time , it has a memory , it moves , things flow within it , it has a kind of consistency — people can die , but it does n't die ; it still persists — and it has a kind of resilience that allows it to persist across time .
and so , i came to see these kinds of social networks as living things , as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope to study and analyze and understand .
and we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena .
why do we show our emotions ?
i mean , there would be an advantage to experiencing our emotions inside , you know , anger or happiness .
there 's emotional contagion that takes place in human populations .
and that , in fact , if we really want to understand human emotions , we need to think about them in this way .
`` so , for example , i was giving this talk recently in new york city , and i said , `` '' you know when you 're on the subway and the other person across the subway car smiles at you , and you just instinctively smile back ? '' '' and they looked at me and said , `` '' we do n't do that in new york city . '' '' ( laughter ) and i said , `` '' everywhere else in the world , that 's normal human behavior . '' '' and so there 's a very instinctive way in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other . ''
the question that we wanted to ask was : could emotion spread , in a more sustained way than riots , across time and involve large numbers of people , not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car ?
maybe there 's a kind of below the surface , quiet riot that animates us all the time .
maybe there are emotional stampedes that ripple through social networks .
and this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon .
again , a social network , but now we color the people yellow if they 're happy and blue if they 're sad and green in between .
and you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network .
there 's a middle and an edge to this network , and the unhappy people seem to be located at the edges .
so to invoke another metaphor , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity — i 'm connected to you and you to her , on out endlessly into the distance — this fabric is actually like an old-fashioned american quilt , and it has patches on it : happy and unhappy patches .
and whether you become happy or not depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch .
why do they not look like this ?
why do n't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice ?
and notice first of all — so , to understand this , though , we need to dissect network structure a little bit first — and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person .
so , for example , here is a real network of college students at an elite northeastern university .
and now i 'm highlighting a few dots .
if you look here at the dots , compare node b in the upper left to node d in the far right ; b has four friends coming out from him and d has six friends coming out from him .
and so , those two individuals have different numbers of friends .
that 's very obvious , we all know that .
but certain other aspects of social network structure are not so obvious .
compare node b in the upper left to node a in the lower left .
so the friend of a friend of a 's is , back again , a friend of a 's , whereas the friend of a friend of b 's is not a friend of b 's , but is farther away in the network .
and , finally , compare nodes c and d : c and d both have six friends .
`` that 's my social experience . '' '' but now we , with a bird 's eye view looking at this network , can see that they occupy very different social worlds . ''
and i can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you : who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network ?
would you rather be c or d ?
so different structural locations have different implications for your life .
and , in fact , when we did some experiments looking at this , what we found is that 46 percent of the variation in how many friends you have is explained by your genes .
and this is not surprising . we know that some people are born shy and some are born gregarious . that 's obvious .
but we also found some non-obvious things .
for instance , 47 percent in the variation in whether your friends know each other is attributable to your genes .
and finally , we even found that 30 percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes .
now , what is the point of this ?
figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days ?
well , the argument i 'd like to make is that networks have value .
they are a kind of social capital .
new properties emerge because of our embeddedness in social networks , and these properties inhere in the structure of the networks , not just in the individuals within them .
but if you take the same carbon atoms and interconnect them a different way , you get diamond , which is clear and hard .
it is the ties between people that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts .
and so it is not just what 's happening to these people — whether they 're losing weight or gaining weight , or becoming rich or becoming poor , or becoming happy or not becoming happy — that affects us ; it 's also the actual architecture of the ties around us .
like , for example , a hive of bees that 's finding a new nesting site , or a flock of birds that 's evading a predator , or a flock of birds that 's able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the pacific , or a pack of wolves that 's able to bring down larger prey .
superorganisms have properties that can not be understood just by studying the individuals .
i think understanding social networks and how they form and operate can help us understand not just health and emotions but all kinds of other phenomena — like crime , and warfare , and economic phenomena like bank runs and market crashes and the adoption of innovation and the spread of product adoption .
now , look at this .
if i was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs , you would cut the ties to me , and the network would disintegrate .
i think , in fact , that if we realized how valuable social networks are , we 'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them , because i think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness .
and what i think the world needs now is more connections .
( applause )
we are stealing nature from our children .
so let me explain .
right now , humans use half of the world to live , to grow their crops and their timber , to pasture their animals .
if you added up all the human beings , we would weigh 10 times as much as all the wild mammals put together .
we cut roads through the forest .
so when you take your next breath , you 'll be breathing in 42 percent more carbon dioxide than if you were breathing in 1750 .
now , it 's still just a proposed epoch , but i think it 's a helpful way to think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet .
so where does this put nature ?
many of these places have no roads or few roads , so on , like such .
but ultimately , even these edens are deeply influenced by humans .
massive ripple effects changed grasslands into forests , changed the composition of forest from one tree to another .
and the case is the same for the other continents as well .
humans have just been involved in nature in a very influential way for a very long time .
`` now , just recently , someone told me , `` oh , but there are still wild places . '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' where ? where ? i want to go . '' '' and he said , `` '' the amazon . '' '' and i was like , `` '' oh , the amazon . i was just there . ''
people have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years .
they hunt . they grow crops .
and many other tropical forests are the same , and not just tropical forests .
now , if we do it that way , what do we get ?
well , it 's this kind of miracle .
crater lake in southern oregon , which is my closest national park , is a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the past .
so to deal with this , the park service has been planting rust-resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park , even in areas that they are otherwise managing as wilderness .
native species are reintroduced .
additionally , these sort of edenic places are often distant from where people live .
so this means that they 're only available to the elites , and that 's a real problem .
`` and when they asked them why , what are the barriers to going outside , the response of 61 percent was , `` there are no natural areas near my home . '' ''
and this is crazy . this is just patently false .
i mean , 71 percent of people in the us live within a 10-minute walk of a city park .
everybody lives near nature .
and they 've sent people up there to do sort of biosurveys , and there are over 50 plant species up there .
it 's creating soil . it 's sequestering carbon .
there 's pollination going on .
`` so scientists have started calling ecosystems like these `` '' novel ecosystems , '' '' because they 're often dominated by non-native species , and because they 're just super weird . ''
and of course , pretty much all of hawaii , where novel ecosystems are the norm , where exotic species totally dominate .
you can make your own novel ecosystem , too .
if we dismiss these new natures as not acceptable or trashy or no good , we might as well just pave them over .
and in a world where everything is changing , we need to be very careful about how we define nature .
first , we can not define nature as that which is untouched .
which brings me to the second thing that we have to do , which is that we have to let children touch nature , because that which is untouched is unloved .
( applause ) we face some pretty grim environmental challenges on this planet .
climate change is among them .
if we have a generation that does n't know how to build a fort , we 'll have a generation that does n't know how to care about nature .
( applause )
as we passed , two boys were climbing the mount kenya of trash .
`` this is a typical pathway in rocinha called a `` '' beco '' '' — these are how you get around the community . ''
now , frank did n't hear anything .
but here are a couple things i can say .
well , here 's one example , in fact .
in britain , 63 percent of all men who come out of short sentences from prison re-offend again within a year .
now how many previous offenses do you think they have on average managed to commit ?
forty-three .
and how many previous times do you think they 've been in prison ?
seven .
it 's got to be worth something , right ?
i mean , there 's prison costs , there 's police costs , there 's court costs , all these things that you 're spending money on to deal with these guys . what 's it worth ?
now , of course , we care about the social value .
but we wanted to make the economic case , because if we could make the economic case , then the value of doing this would be completely compelling .
and if we can agree on both a value and a way of measuring whether we 've been successful at reducing that re-offending , then we can do something we think rather interesting .
but actually , there 's a lot of people who , if they 're given the chance , would love to invest in something that does social good .
now , each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison .
so we get paid for crimes saved .
investors get two opportunities : for the first time , they can invest in social change .
they 're going to have to care in the social program , but if this builds a track record over five or 10 years , then you can widen that investor community as more people have confidence in the product .
society wins : fewer crimes , fewer victims .
now , the offenders , they also benefit .
social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people .
more troublingly , 27 percent of offenders in prison have spent some time in care .
so we set up a program with essex county council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system .
essex only pays in the event that it 's saving them care costs .
investors have put in 3.1 million pounds .
others , around homelessness in london , around youth and employment and education elsewhere in the country .
there are now 13 social impact bonds in britain , and amazing levels of interest in this idea all over the world .
so david cameron 's put 20 million pounds into a social outcomes fund to support this idea .
obama has suggested 300 million dollars in the u.s. budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward , and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest .
why is this so different for people ?
well , the first piece , which we 've talked about , is innovation .
the second piece it brings is rigor .
and we learn and adapt the program accordingly .
and again , in peterborough , we started off with a program , but we also collected data , and over the period of time , we nuanced and changed that program to add a range of other elements , so that the service adapts and we meet the needs of the long term as well as the short term : greater engagement from the prisoners , longer-term engagement as well .
the last element is partnership .
there is , at the moment , a stale debate going on very often : state 's better , public sector 's better , private sector 's better , social sector 's better , for a lot of these programs .
so where does this leave us ?
this leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change .
we 've met champions all over the public sector keen to make these kinds of differences .
thank you .
that turned out to be not such an easy task .
so can brains change ?
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the israeli flag .
and the client was saying , no , it 's 10,000 a day .
`` ( laughter ) ( `` '' 10,000 missiles '' '' ) this is the context . this is where we are now in israel . ''
so at some point it became , you know , to me , i 'm a graphic designer , so i made posters about it and i posted the one i just showed you before .
so i went to sleep , and that was it for me .
and later on in the night , i woke up because i 'm always waking up in the night , and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots , you know , on facebook , which i 've never seen before .
`` ( laughter ) and i was like , `` '' what 's going on ? '' '' so i come to the computer and i start looking on , and suddenly i see many people talking to me , most of them i do n't know , and a few of them from iran , which is — what ? ''
and now people from iran are talking to me .
so i 'm like , whoa .
i ask my wife to come , and i tell her , you have to see that .
people are crying , and she came , she read the text , and she started to cry .
and everybody 's crying now . ( laughter ) so i do n't know what to do , so my first reflex , as a graphic designer , is , you know , to show everybody what i 'd just seen , and people started to see them and to share them , and that 's how it started .
so i 'm going to shoot all the people i know , if they want , and i 'm going to put them in a poster and i 'm going to share them .
`` tell the iranians we from israel love you too . '' '' it became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense . ''
it was a huge amount of pictures .
so for a few days , that 's how my living room was .
and we took these messages and we made posters out of it , because i know people : they do n't read , they see images .
and she wished that we 'd meet and come to visit one another , and just a few days after i posted the first poster .
the day after , iranians started to respond with their own posters .
they have graphic designers . what ? ( laughter ) crazy , crazy .
they want to respond . they want to say the same thing .
`` ( `` '' my israeli friends . i do n't hate you . i do n't want war . '' '' ) this never happened before , and this is two people supposed to be enemies , we 're on the verge of a war , and suddenly people on facebook are starting to say , `` i like this guy . i love those guys . '' ''
and it became really big at some point .
because when you 're seeing the middle east , you see only the bad news .
`` and suddenly , there is something that was happening that was good news . so the guys on the news , they say , `` '' okay , let 's talk about this . '' '' and they just came , and it was so much , i remember one day , michal , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , `` who 's gon na see the show ? `` and he said , `` everybody . '' ''
`` so she said , `` '' everybody in palestine , in where ? israel ? ''
`` who is everybody ? '' '' '' '' everybody . '' '' they said , `` '' syria ? '' '' `` `` syria . '' '' `` lebanon ? '' '' lebanon . '' ''
`` at some point , he just said , `` '' 40 million people are going to see you today . ''
`` it 's everybody . '' '' the chinese . ''
`` the moment i really understood that something was happening , a friend of mine told me , `` google the word 'israel . ' '' and those were the first images on those days that popped up from google when you were typing , `` '' israel '' '' or `` '' iran . '' '' we really changed how people see the middle east . ''
and for a few days you got those images .
today the israel-loves-iran page is this number , 80,831 , and two million people last week went on the page and shared , liked , i do n't know , commented on one of the photos .
we 're showing a new reality by just making images because that 's how the world perceives us .
they see images of us , and they see bad images .
so we 're working on making good images . end of story .
look at this one . this is the iran-loves-israel page .
this is a guy in tehran on the day of remembrance of the israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an israeli soldier on his page .
`` ( `` '' our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearests in terror attack in bulgaria '' '' ) and it 's going both ways . ''
and you become friends .
`` i went there to open an exposition about iran and i met there with people from the page that told me , `` '' okay , you 're going to be in europe , i 'm coming . i 'm coming from france , from holland , from germany , '' '' of course , and from israel people came , and we just met there for the first time in real life . ''
and that was the end of it .
remember that image from the beginning ?
and it goes the other way around .
just read where those guys are from .
crazy , yes ?
my name is ronny edry , and i 'm 41 , i 'm an israeli , i 'm a father of two , i 'm a husband , and i 'm a graphic designer . i 'm teaching graphic design .
`` and i 'm not that naive , because a lot of the time i 've been asked , many times i 've been asked , `` '' yeah , but , this is really naive , sending flowers over , i mean — `` '' i was in the army . i was in the paratroopers for three years , and i know how it looks from the ground . ''
so to me , this is the courageous thing to do , to try to reach the other side before it 's too late , because when it 's going to be too late , it 's going to be too late .
maybe as people , because especially in israel , we 're in a democracy . we have the freedom of speech , and maybe that little thing can change something .
so i want to ask michal , my wife , to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image , because it 's all about images .
just raise that . exactly .
oh my god .
do n't cry .
thank you guys .

in june of 1998 , tori murden mcclure left nags head , north carolina for france .
that 's her boat , the american pearl .
tori and her friends built it by hand , and it weighed about 1,800 pounds .
her plan was to row it alone across the atlantic ocean — no motor , no sail — something no woman and no american had ever done before .
several years earlier , she 'd become the first woman to ski to the south pole .
she was an accomplished rower in college , even competed for a spot on the 1992 u.s. olympic team , but this , this was different .
sector time 9 a.m .
and as frustrating as those days were , other days were like this .
i 'm not very happy right now .
as happy as i was this morning , i am unhappy now , so ...
dl : after nearly three months at sea , she 'd covered over 3,000 miles .
some of them were pitchpole capsizes , flipping her end over end , and rowing became impossible .
i have the argus beacon with me .
it 's so far underwater right now , the only part that 's showing pretty much is the cabin .
i seem to capsize about every 15 minutes .
the waves are tearing the boat to shreds .
for 13 long years , that was my reality .
i 've thought a lot about it .
i 've had a lot of time to think .
i would eventually fail every test for mental awareness .
my parents were told i was as good as not there .
their friends drifted away .
one year turned to two , two turned to three .
the lego blocks and electronic circuits i 'd loved as a boy were put away .
i could see and understand everything , but i could n't find a way to let anybody know .
my personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body , a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis .
i would never be rescued .
no one would ever love me .
well , nothing pleasant .
other people controlled every aspect of my life .
whether i was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair .
i was completely powerless to change anything in my life or people 's perceptions of me .
i was a silent , invisible observer of how people behaved when they thought no one was watching .
for more than 10 years , people who were charged with my care abused me physically , verbally and sexually .
how could they do this to me ?
what had i done to deserve this ?
part of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight .
there was no one to comfort me .
but neither of my parents knew this was happening .
i just never knew when .
all i knew was that i would never be the same .
`` and i thought to myself , `` '' you want to bet ? '' '' perhaps my parents could have found out and could have helped . ''
following yet another heated argument between my parents , in a moment of despair and desperation , my mother turned to me and told me that i should die .
i remember one particularly low moment .
i may never know why , but that simple act , the fleeting moment of human connection , transformed how i was feeling , making me want to keep going .
alone with my thoughts , i constructed intricate fantasies about ants running across the floor .
to some i was martin , a vacant shell , the vegetable , deserving of harsh words , dismissal and even abuse .
to others , i was the tragically brain-damaged boy who had grown to become a man .
it is about getting the message heard and respected .
still , things were going well .
however , i longed to share my life with someone .
once , i was perceived to be an inanimate object , a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair .
today , i am so much more .
but i wonder , do they ?
our words , however we communicate them , are just as powerful .
the act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light .
( applause )
i mean , nine years is a long time .
occasionally i still get recognized at the mall or whatever .
and when i do , it 's as a bit of a know-it-all .
i think that ship has sailed , it 's too late for me .
for better or for worse , that 's what i 'm going to be known as , as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff .
and i ca n't complain about this .
i feel like that was always sort of my destiny , although i had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet .
if nothing else , you realize very quickly as a teenager , it is not a hit with girls to know captain kirk 's middle name .
( laughter ) and as a result , i was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years .
but if you go further back , if you look at it , it 's all there .
i now have a 10-year-old of my own who 's exactly the same .
and i know how deeply annoying it is , so karma does work .
( laughter ) and i loved game shows , fascinated with game shows .
it was my favorite show , even before it paid for my house .
and we lived overseas , we lived in south korea where my dad was working , where there was only one english language tv channel .
there 's a weird sense of mastery you get when you know some bit of boomer trivia that mom and dad do n't know .
you know some beatles factoid that dad did n't know .
i never had a guidance counselor who thought this was a legitimate career path , that thought you could major in trivia or be a professional ex-game show contestant .
and so i sold out way too young .
`` and it made it doubly ironic — my computer background — a few years later , i think 2009 or so , when i got another phone call from `` '' jeopardy '' '' saying , `` '' it 's early days yet , but ibm tells us they want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'jeopardy . ' are you up for this ? '' '' this was the first i 'd heard of it . ''
and of course i said yes , for several reasons .
`` one , because playing `` '' jeopardy '' '' is a great time . ''
i was not going to say no .
the third reason i said yes is because i was pretty confident that i was going to win .
i had taken some artificial intelligence classes .
the kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human , little kid could do , very hard for a computer .
i remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph .
but then you see the line start to go up .
and it 's getting very close to what they call the winner 's cloud .
and i noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots , some black dots , that were a different color .
and i saw this line coming for me .
and i realized , this is it .
( laughter ) it 's not the terminator 's gun sight ; it 's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do , the only thing that makes you special , the thing you 're best at .
`` we were not playing in l.a. on the regular `` '' jeopardy '' '' set . ''
it 's thousands of processors , a terabyte of memory , trillions of bytes of memory .
so me and the other human player wound up at this secret ibm research lab in the middle of these snowy woods in westchester county to play the computer .
and we realized right away that the computer had a big home court advantage .
like you 're going to play the chicago bulls , and there 's the thing in the middle of their court .
`` and the crowd was full of ibm v.p.s and programmers cheering on their little darling , having poured millions of dollars into this hoping against hope that the humans screw up , and holding up `` '' go watson '' '' signs and just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right . ''
`` i think guys had `` '' w-a-t-s-o-n '' '' written on their bellies in grease paint . ''
it had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer .
and you could hear that little tick , tick , tick , tick .
and i remember thinking , this is it .
i felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers .
and it has n't been the last .
if you watch the news , you 'll see occasionally — and i see this all the time — that pharmacists now , there 's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist .
you do n't need human assistants for that anymore .
and obviously these new technologies ca n't do as clever or creative a job as the humans they 're replacing , but they 're faster , and crucially , they 're much , much cheaper .
so it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be .
i 've heard other people say quite the opposite , that this is yet another tier of the middle class that 's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous , something that we should worry about .
and it was friggin ' demoralizing . it was terrible .
here 's the one thing that i was ever good at , and all it took was ibm pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do the same thing .
`` they could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national tv , and `` '' i 'm sorry , ken . we do n't need you anymore . '' '' and it made me think , what does this mean , if we 're going to be able to start outsourcing , not just lower unimportant brain functions . ''
and as a result , a part of our brain that 's supposed to do that kind of stuff gets smaller and dumber .
the more i thought about it , i realized , no , it 's still important .
the advantage of volume , first , just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays .
now it 's really not possible to be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor .
they say that the scope of human information is now doubling every 18 months or so , the sum total of human information .
it 's doubling every 18 months now .
this is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make require the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts .
`` at some point you 're just going to be like , `` you know what ? there 's too much to know . screw it . '' ''
and you 'll make a less informed decision .
`` she runs up to them on the beach one morning and says , `` '' mom , dad , we 've got to get off the beach . '' '' and they say , `` '' what do you mean ? we just got here . '' '' and she said , `` '' in mr. kearney 's geography class last month , he told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea and you see the waves churning way out there , that 's the sign of a tsunami , and you need to clear the beach . '' '' what would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this ? ''
they told the lifeguard , they went back to the hotel , and the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach , luckily , because that was the day of the boxing day tsunami , the day after christmas , 2004 , that killed thousands of people in southeast asia and around the indian ocean .
and it happens in real life all the time .
it 's a meeting or job interview or first date or some relationship that gets lubricated because two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge .
it 's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met .
that 's often the advantage of time .
`` and it 's not effective if you say , `` '' well , hold on . ''
you 're from fargo , north dakota . let me see what comes up .
`` ( laughter ) the great 18th-century british theologian and thinker , friend of dr. johnson , samuel parr once said , `` '' it 's always better to know a thing than not to know it . '' '' and if i have lived my life by any kind of creed , it 's probably that . ''
i do n't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty , so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together .
`` i do n't want to be the last trivia know-it-all sitting on a mountain somewhere , reciting to himself the state capitals and the names of `` '' simpsons '' '' episodes and the lyrics of abba songs . ''
those movies are never about beautiful utopias .
and i feel like we 're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in .
and on the other hand , we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we 've all decided it 's not important what we know anymore , that knowledge is n't valuable because it 's all out there in the cloud , and why would we ever bother learning anything new .
and we can all make that choice .
`` i do n't have to learn new things anymore . '' '' no , every day we should be striving to learn something new . ''
we should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us .
`` that 's where the people you see on `` '' jeopardy '' '' come from . ''
these know-it-alls , they 're not rainman-style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book .
i 've met a lot of them .
we can live in one of these two worlds .
ladies and gentlemen , the choice is yours .
thank you very much .
so , we 're going to put up some slides of some of your companies here .
ca : post-napster , you 're looking like a bit of a genius , actually , for that as well .
but , yeah , it was sad at the time , but we moved on .
i mean , virgin brides — what happened there ?
ca : so , just help us with some of the numbers .
ca : and how many employees ?
rb : dropping in for tea .
ca : so , we 'll just run a couple more pictures here . virgin brides . very nice .
but nowhere else anyway .
rb : i 'll go get the secretary to use it .
ca : ok. so let 's look at the space thing .
rb : philippe has done the — yeah , quite a bit of it : the logos and he 's building the space station in new mexico .
ca : but you did n't have him design the engine ?
rb : philippe is quite erratic , so i think that he would n't be the best person to design the engine , no .
ca : so , now , you 've always had this exploration bug in you .
well , i got pulled out of the sea i think six times by helicopters , so — and each time , i did n't expect to come home to tell the tale .
rb : well , i knew i had about half an hour 's fuel left , and i also knew that the chances were that if i jumped , i would only have a couple of minutes of life left .
so i climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried to make sure that i was making the right decision .
but it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and — ca : what did you write to your family ?
i certainly would have failed iq tests .
here 's a net in the sea , and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net .
ca : you did n't turn out too bad , i have to say , i 'm ...
and he asked if i could find a linguistics expert to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks .
and i actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well , and i like to think that 's how we run virgin .
and so we spend a very good sort of three months away together .
rb : well , there 's — i mean there 's a lot of issues .
and i think it 's important that people in that kind of position do make a difference .
and i thought i was alone in the dark under this tree .
and they moved their bodies and they came forward , and the lights bounced off these costumes .
it was n't going to be written down . it was no news .
antonio : here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon .
ariel : i have made you mad .
and all of a sudden , the audience 's perspective changes .
circus , rock 'n ' roll , drama .
`` we survive because our theme song is `` '' rise above . '' '' boy falls from the sky , rise above . ''
but more generally , this noise is something that corrupts the signal .
you probably have n't thought that much about it .
you may have heard of it .
`` `` '' my air jordans cost a hundred with tax . ''
my leather adidas baseball cap matches my fake gucci backpack . ( laughter ) ai n't nobody who looks as good as me , but this costs money , it sure ai n't free , and i gots no job , no money at all , but it 's easy to steal all this from the mall .
parents say i should n't , but i knows i should .
when i 'm wearing fresh gear i do n't have to hide , and i really must get some new gear soon or my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon .
my crew is laughing at me because i 'm wearing old gear .
and i 'm sportin ' torn jordans .
maybe i 'll get lucky and find easy prey .
got to get some new gear . there 's no other way .
this is serious business . this ai n't no fun .
not one spot of dirt . the airs were brand new .
took off fast , did n't get far . i fired , 'pow ! ' fool fell between two parked cars .
he was coughing , crying , blood spilled on the street .
`` while laying there dying , all he could say was , `` '' please man , do n't take my air jordans away . '' '' you 'd think he 'd be worried about staying alive . ''
as i took off with his sneakers , there was tears in his eyes .
`` i killed to get 'em , but hey , i do n't care , because now i needs a new jacket to wear . '' '' thank you . ( applause ) for the last 15 years that i have been performing , all i ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world . ''
see , it was n't enough for me to write a book .
the hunger and thirst was , and still remains : how do i get people who hate poetry to love me ?
`` and in 1996 , i found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named reg e. gaines , who wrote the famous poem , `` '' please do n't take my air jordans . '' '' and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ? ''
`` `` '' yo ' wack . ''
`` you do n't read other people 's poetry , and you do n't got any subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration . '' '' ( laughter ) now he kept on rambling about poetry and styles and nuyorican friday nights . ''
i mean , i thought poetry was just self-expression .
i would wake him up at , like , 6:30 in the morning to ask him who 's the best poet .
`` i wanted to know which poet he read , and i landed on a poem called [ `` '' dark prophecy : sing of shine '' '' ] , a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be : broadway , baby . ''
and from that point , i learned how to pull the mic away and attack the poetry with my body .
but that was n't the biggest lesson i ever learned .
the biggest lesson i learned was many years later when i went to beverly hills and i ran into a talent agent who looked at me up and down and said i do n't look like i have any experience to be working in this business .
`` and i said to him , `` '' listen , punk fool , you 're a failed actor who became an agent , and you know why you failed as an actor ? ''
because people like me took your job .
i 've traveled all the way from cleveland and essex in east new york , took the local 6 line up to the hookers of hunt 's point who were in my way on my way to master the art of space , and the one-to-infinite amount of man , woman and child you can fit in there only so i can push them to the back of the wall with my experience .
i 'm so experienced that when you went to the fell school and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it , that was me , but kicked me out when i was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the pats off a pair of lee jeans and bring them to vim . let me see chekhov pull that off .
`` sanford meisner was my uncle artie yelling silently to himself , `` something 's always wrong when nothing 's always right . '' ''
i could make david mamet psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue , stanislavski be as if he were bruce lee kicking your roster of talentless students up and down crenshaw .
so what , your actors studied guerrilla theater at the london rep ?
forget the american ghetto . i 've cracked stages in soweto , buried abortion babies in potter 's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face , so whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack go-for-this , go-for-that assistant when i walk out that door , whatever slander you send my way , your mother .
thank you . ( applause )
i became one of the working homeless .
at first , living in the van was great .
but then the anger and the depression about my father 's death set in .
the doggy went into doggy day care .
so i went in the bookstore . and i found tim 's book .
there was something really wrong with me .
this was about a year before 9/11 , and america was n't at war yet .
we were not yet talking about the effect of trauma and war on the human psyche .
we saw some very ugly things .
i did n't think much about it .
the trains were going too fast .
everything was too loud , everything was moving too quickly .
later , i found out that what i had was short-term ptsd : post-traumatic stress disorder .
you want to have nightmares and flashbacks of the thing that could kill you .
keeps you safe .
it 's not very pleasant , but it 's better than getting eaten .
it takes a few weeks , a few months .
they are not adapted to temporary danger .
as a result , the casualty rates have gone down .
the recent wars in iraq and afghanistan have produced , thank god , a casualty rate about one third of what it was in vietnam .
around 10 percent of the us military is actively engaged in combat , 10 percent or under .
they 're shooting at people , killing people , getting shot at , seeing their friends get killed .
it 's incredibly traumatic .
but about half of our military has filed for some kind of ptsd compensation from the government .
in fact , there 's no statistical connection between combat and suicide .
if you 're in the military and you 're in a lot of combat , you 're no more likely to kill yourself than if you were n't .
i studied anthropology in college .
i did my fieldwork on the navajo reservation .
i wrote a thesis on navajo long-distance runners .
as wealth goes up in a society , the suicide rate goes up instead of down .
if you live in modern society , you 're up to eight times more likely to suffer from depression in your lifetime than if you live in a poor , agrarian society .
modern society has probably produced the highest rates of suicide and depression and anxiety and loneliness and child abuse ever in human history .
and the highest rates of depression were urban women in north america .
so let 's go back to the us military .
ten percent are in combat .
maybe it 's this : maybe they had an experience of sort of tribal closeness in their unit when they were overseas .
it 's just hard on everybody .
and we keep focusing on trauma , ptsd .
it 's as if they 're all in one big tribe .
we know that if you take a lab rat and traumatize it and put it in a cage by itself , you can maintain its trauma symptoms almost indefinitely .
and if you take that same lab rat and put it in a cage with other rats , after a couple of weeks , it 's pretty much ok .
the suicide rate went down .
the violent crime rate in new york went down after 9/11 .
the reason is that if you traumatize an entire society , we do n't fall apart and turn on one another .
we come together . we unify .
we were sticking together .
we were trying to understand the threat against us .
now , american soldiers , american veterans are coming back to a country that is so bitterly divided that the two political parties are literally accusing each other of treason , of being an enemy of the state , of trying to undermine the security and the welfare of their own country .
there are demonstrations and even riots in the streets because of racial injustice .
and veterans know that any tribe that treated itself that way — in fact , any platoon that treated itself that way — would never survive .
we 've gotten used to it .
veterans have gone away and are coming back and seeing their own country with fresh eyes .
and they see what 's going on .
i think the real question is if we can save ourselves .
if we can , i think the vets are going to be fine .
thank you very much .
we talked about the tv show we watched that evening .
and this is where the solar cell and the led come in .
and this is why i have been looking into solar cells and solar panels .
now let me show you in practice .
but in order to prove the point , i can block the light of the solar cell .
( applause ) and i can repeat that .
so that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver .
but now imagine that this led lamp is a street light , and there 's fog .
and it really does n't matter where the beam hits the solar cell .
so it 's an interesting paradox at play there .
originally , they are pig breeders .
i was looking for the st. simon monastery on the top of the muqattam mountain .
uncle ibrahim was always hanging out on the balcony and talking to me while i was painting .
the next video is not done by us .
this is cbs sunday morning that aired about two weeks ago .
you can see : there 's the plant .
unhappy with both options , i did the only thing that made sense to me .
i made a physical version of flappy bird that could never be taken off the app store .
although it was pretty challenging , they learned a lot of new concepts in engineering and programming .
so i started looking for more creative ways to introduce technology to students .
so that 's certainly not very affordable for most classroom budgets .
i started with paper and fabric .
after all , we all played with those since we were kids , and they are also pretty cheap and can be found anywhere around the house .
and i also started to take these workshops outside of school and into the community .
and something really interesting happened .
now take a look at this employee report at a major technology company in 2016 .
women make up only 19 percent of the technology workforce .
now , there 's a wide variety of problems that contribute to the lack of diversity in the technology force .
perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects .
most students think that it 's boring or unwelcoming , so i have always designed projects following three principles .
the first project we asked students to learn is to make a circuit on paper .
and having a low floor also means that we 're removing the financial barrier that prevents people from completing a project .
so with paper , copper tape , lightbulb and a battery , people can complete this project for under a dollar .
so second principle is having a high ceiling .
at first it might just be a light-up creature , but then you can add sensors and microcontrollers , and start to program the creature to interact with its environment .
( laughter ) and finally , the third principle is customization .
that 's the beauty of using everyday materials ; it 's very easy to customize using paper and fabric .
millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around syria .
you have yourself warned about the situation and about the consequences of a breakdown of libya , for example , and yet europe looked totally unprepared .
you talk about one million people .
bg : let me try to bring up three questions , playing a bit devil 's advocate .
turkey has now two million three-hundred thousand or something of the sort , if you count all refugees .
so i do n't think it 's fair to say how many we can take .
so , what 's your position ?
ag : if there would be a proper management of the situation and the proper distribution of people all over europe , you would always have the percentage that i mentioned : one per each 2,000 .
that reflects the general underfunding of the organizations working on these issues .
we were much worse during the summer .
and , of course , if you look at today 's situation of the indicators in these countries , it is clear that , especially their poor groups of the population , are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing .
bg : who should be providing this support ?
now , i 've been in government .
`` and it 's just telling them , `` '' you are right , we are against you . '' '' so obviously , this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic , multi-religious , multicultural , this is creating a situation in which , really , it is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations to be effective in recruiting people for terror acts within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed . ''
and i think that is part of daesh 's strategy to make europe react , closing its doors to muslim refugees and having an hostility towards muslims inside europe , exactly to facilitate daesh 's work .
and my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement that triggered terrorism .
for me it is clear .
bg : question : you are stepping down from your job at the end of the year , after 10 years .
ag : well , look : in 2005 , we were helping one million people go back home in safety and dignity , because conflicts had ended .
last year , we helped 124,000 .
so that , i will not do .
`` if i had to say something to him , it would be , `` '' be yourself , and do your best . '' '' bg : commissioner , thank you for the job you do . ''
thank you for coming to ted .
landscape was not enough .
second woman : dad , mom , i grew up .
our energy sources are not sustainable .
so what are we waiting for ?
to finish , i would like to welcome the 4,700th baby born since the beginning of this talk .
now it 's a little extreme , i admit .
getting me all wound up , now !
and that 's the reason i beat him , actually , because i respected him .
but i knew it was about social change .
so there were nine of us that signed that one-dollar contract .
but every generation has the chance to make it better .
for women : self-confidence , empowerment .
they got to play team sports in a way they had n't before .
the one thing i wanted was data — facts .
and they do n't really care .
here 's the first example .
and as we get farther away , the sound gets fainter and fainter .
i 'll discuss two very promising approaches .
the first case comes from the bay of fundy .
we can be very creative about thinking of different ways to reduce these risks .
( applause )
that 's because most people think architects design buildings and cities , but what we really design are relationships , because cities are about people .
my team and i have been applying insights from ecology to architecture to see how physical space can help build stronger relationships .
the projects i 'm going to show you today use the idea of building relationships as the key driver for design .
here 's an example of what i mean .
the students wanted a place for cultural exchange .
and they wanted to be welcoming to the outside community .
and everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible to the outside world .
so we designed a space just like that right in the middle of the arcus center , and we anchored it with a fireplace and a kitchen .
and now the central space works for big social gatherings and a place to meet one-on-one for the very first time .
you can sit by the fireplace and share stories .
so making the walls is equivalent to taking cars right off the road .
we chose the building method because it connects people to each other and to the environment .
but in several major cities , i 've been designing tall buildings that are based on creating relationships between people .
this is aqua .
now , just by being able to go outside on your balcony or on the third floor roof terrace , you can be connected to the outdoors , even when you 're way above the ground plane .
so the building acts to create community within the building and the city at the same time .
and equity is the key issue here .
you know , in my field , there 's a debate about whether architecture can even do anything to improve social relationships .
but i believe that we need architecture and every tool in our tool kit to improve these relationships .
we asked ourselves simply : can design help rebuild trust ?
in north lawndale , people are afraid of police and of going anywhere near the police station , even to report a crime .
`` it 's called `` '' polis station . '' '' `` `` polis '' '' is a greek word that means a place with a sense of community . ''
so with the help of the city and the parks , we were able to raise funds and design and build a half-court , right on the police station parking lot .
it 's a start .
but is it rebuilding trust ?
the people in north lawndale say the kids are using the courts every day and they even organize tournaments like this one shown here , and once in a while an officer joins in .
but now , they even have basketballs inside the station that kids can borrow .
before , there was fear of going anywhere the station , and now they say there 's a sense that the court is safer than other courts nearby , and they prefer their kids to play here .
so maybe in the future , on the public side of the station , you might be able to drop in for a haircut at the barbershop or reserve the community room for a birthday party or renew your driver 's license or get money out of an atm .
engaging the public can be intimidating , and i 've felt that , too .
but i think that can change , too .
we can reduce the stress and the polarization in our urban habitats .
we can help steady this planet we all share .

i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p.o . box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in texting or cell phones in general .
and so while other kids were bbm-ing their parents , i was literally waiting by the mailbox to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone , which was a little frustrating when grandma was in the hospital , but i was just looking for some sort of scribble , some unkempt cursive from my mother .
i wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers , and tucked them all throughout the city , dozens and dozens of them . i left them everywhere , in cafes and in libraries , at the u.n. , everywhere .
i blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary , and i posed a kind of crazy promise to the internet : that if you asked me for a hand-written letter , i would write you one , no questions asked .
overnight , my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak — a single mother in sacramento , a girl being bullied in rural kansas , all asking me , a 22-year-old girl who barely even knew her own coffee order , to write them a love letter and give them a reason to wait by the mailbox .
well , today i fuel a global organization that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox , fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media like never before to write and mail strangers letters when they need them most , but most of all , fueled by crates of mail like this one , my trusty mail crate , filled with the scriptings of ordinary people , strangers writing letters to other strangers not because they 're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee , but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing .
they 're the ones from my generation , the ones of us that have grown up into a world where everything is paperless , and where some of our best conversations have happened upon a screen .
`` if you ever need one , just carry one of these . ( laughter ) and a man just stared at me , and he was like , `` well , why do n't you use the internet ? '' ''
`` and i thought , `` '' well , sir , i am not a strategist , nor am i specialist . i am merely a storyteller . '' '' and so i could tell you about a woman whose husband has just come home from afghanistan , and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation , and so she tucks love letters throughout the house as a way to say , `` '' come back to me . ''
well , tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters just like this one tucked beneath his pillow , scripted by strangers who were there for him when .
`` the mere fact that somebody would even just sit down , pull out a piece of paper and think about someone the whole way through , with an intention that is so much harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iphone is pinging and we 've got six conversations rolling in at once , that is an art form that does not fall down to the goliath of `` '' get faster , '' '' no matter how many social networks we might join . ''
we still clutch close these letters to our chest , to the words that speak louder than loud , when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to sisters and brothers and even to strangers , for far too long .
and you can really feel the sound . that was my point with that .
and they 're very adept . they like to drag it and drop it from appendage to appendage .
i once had this nightmare : i 'm standing in the middle of a deserted field full of land mines .
i have this thought in the back of my mind that i might lose a limb .
mohammed , like so many other survivors all around the world , had to live through the horrifying repercussions of cluster munitions on a daily basis .
when the one-month conflict started in lebanon , i was still working at agence france-presse in paris .
i remember how i was glued to the screens , anxiously following the news .
the fact that he lives a five-minute drive from my parents ' home made it easier to follow him through the years .
i saw the teenager who tried to offer his friends tattoos , in return for a set fee of five dollars .
his fate and the effects of losing his legs are now his daily reality .
survivors of bomb trauma like mohammed have to deal with so many details that never occur to us .
who would have imagined that so many daily tasks we do or take for granted , such as going to the beach or even picking up something from the floor , would become sources of stress and anxiety ?
ten years ago , i had no clue what a cluster bomb was , nor its horrifying implications .
`` and what for ? '' '' let me explain to you what a cluster bomb is . ''
it 's a large canister filled with bomblets .
these weapons are extremely unpredictable , which makes the threat even bigger .
lebanon holds some 400,000 palestinian refugees , and they suffer from discriminatory laws .
many who get injured by this weapon drop out of school , ca n't find jobs or even lose their jobs , therefore losing the ability to provide for their families .
these weapons affect the poorest of the poor .
the high medical cost is a burden to the families .
they end up relying on humanitarian agencies , which is insufficient and unsustainable , especially when injuries require lifelong support to the injured .
he suffered from anxiety , poor appetite , sleep disturbance and showed signs of anger .
`` if they could n't find their targets in vietnam , there were free-drop areas in laos where planes would drop their loads before going back to base , because it 's dangerous to land with loaded planes . '' '' according to the international committee of the red cross , in laos alone — one of the poorest countries in the world — nine to 27 million unexploded submunitions remain . ''
some 11,000 people have been killed or injured since 1973 .
cluster bombs have reportedly been used most recently in the ongoing conflicts in yemen and syria .
the majority of these institutions are based in countries that have not yet signed the convention on cluster munitions .
getting back to mohammed , one of the few jobs he was able to find was picking lemons .
eighty-four percent of casualties are males .
culturally , he 's expected to provide for his family , but he simply ca n't .
he tried to have so many different jobs , but he could n't keep any due to his physical disability and the less-than-friendly environment to people with disabilities , to say the least .
`` he said , `` '' i 'm not here to beg for money , i just want to earn it . '' '' mohammed today is 21 years old . ''
here is one of his messages .
as an academic , i was a mere reader .
so how does multispectral imaging actually work ?
so , spectral imaging can recover lost texts .
`` `` subjects . '' ''
in africa , about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke .
in that moment , he became a scholar .
we need clean water to drink .
and we all need a safe place to pee .
i can and do just use the men 's room most of the time these days .
but that does n't solve my change room dilemmas , does it ?
i 'm a trans person .
panty checks ?
and meanwhile , our trans children suffer .
and this starts very early .
she 's a self-identified tomboy .
they already felt empowered enough to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms .
`` `` until you can get home ? '' ''
so let 's just build some single stall , gender-neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes .
so let 's just do it .
right ?
thank you for listening .
( laughter ) ca : ed , some questions for you .
what 's wrong with that point of view ?
so is it really terrorism that we 're stopping ?
how are you coping with the fear ?
( applause )
it 's really a failure to detect a certain kind of danger .
it 's as though we stand before two doors .
a full-scale nuclear war ?
a global pandemic ?
an asteroid impact ?
justin bieber becoming president of the united states ?
at a certain point , we will build machines that are smarter than we are , and once we have machines that are smarter than we are , they will begin to improve themselves .
we do n't hate them .
intelligence is a matter of information processing in physical systems .
and then we have a chicken .
so what would apes like ourselves do in this circumstance ?
this is a winner-take-all scenario .
`` this is how long `` '' the simpsons '' '' has been on television . ''
now , unfortunately , i do n't have a solution to this problem , apart from recommending that more of us think about it .
thank you very much .
but i 'm not a climate scientist , i 'm an astronomer .
you could say that i look for choice alien real estate .
our rovers , like curiosity , crawl across its surface , scratching for clues as to the origins of life as we know it .
even in the driest , highest places on earth , the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests .
but the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another .
the extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas .
they 're just closer to home .
i leave you with a final thought experiment : fermi 's paradox .
it 's a pleasure to be here in edinburgh , scotland , the birthplace of the needle and syringe .
less than a mile from here in this direction , in 1853 a scotsman filed his very first patent on the needle and syringe .
this is the patent .
so we turn to the field of vaccines .
most vaccines are delivered with the needle and syringe , this 160-year-old technology .
but just like any other technology , vaccines have their shortcomings , and the needle and syringe is a key part within that narrative — this old technology .
so let 's start with the obvious : many of us do n't like the needle and syringe .
and the who has figures that suggest about 1.3 million deaths per year take place due to cross-contamination with needlestick injuries .
and the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that i 'll tell you about as well .
to the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp , but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye .
and there 's about 4,000 projections on this particular square compared to the needle .
and i 've designed those projections to serve a key role , which is to work with the skin 's immune system .
so that 's a very important function tied in with the nanopatch .
and this particular technique is one that 's been borrowed from the semiconductor industry , and therefore is low cost and can be rolled out in large numbers .
and it 's a very simple device — you could call it a sophisticated finger .
so firstly , the projections on the nanopatch breach through the tough outer layer and the vaccine is very quickly released — within less than a minute , in fact .
so that gives you an idea of the nanopatch , and immediately you can see some key advantages .
it takes a little while to get our heads around , but i 'll try to explain it in simple terms .
so i 'll take a step back and explain to you how vaccines work in a simple way .
so vaccines work by introducing into our body a thing called an antigen which is a safe form of a germ .
now that safe germ , that antigen , tricks our body into mounting an immune response , learning and remembering how to deal with intruders .
now , the way it 's done today with the needle and syringe , most vaccines are delivered that way — with this old technology and the needle .
to describe this idea , we need to take a journey through the skin , starting with one of those projections and applying the nanopatch to the skin .
now , this is real data — that thing that we can see there is one projection from the nanopatch that 's been applied to the skin and those colors are different layers .
now , to give you an idea of scale , if the needle was shown here , it would be too big .
that red layer is a tough outer layer of dead skin , but the brown layer and the magenta layer are jammed full of immune cells .
we target thousands upon thousands of these particular cells just residing within a hair 's width of the surface of the skin .
it 's getting more systematic .
however , you still do n't really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sleeves up and vaccinate and wait .
it 's a gambler 's game even today .
so on the horizontal axis we have the dose shown in nanograms .
on the vertical axis we have the immune response generated , and that dashed line indicates the protection threshold .
if we 're above that line it 's considered protective ; if we 're below that line it 's not .
but notice immediately the distinctly different curve that we achieve with the blue line .
that 's what 's achieved with the nanopatch ; the delivered dose of the nanopatch is a completely different immunogenicity curve .
suddenly we have a brand new lever in the world of vaccines .
but there 's another angle to this as well — you can take vaccines that currently do n't work and get them over that line and get them protective .
they 're responsible for about 7 million deaths per year , and there is no adequate vaccination method for any of those .
so potentially , with this new lever that we have with the nanopatch , we can help make that happen .
i 'd like to now switch to talk about another key shortcoming of today 's vaccines , and that is the need to maintain the cold chain .
as the name suggests — the cold chain — it 's the requirements of keeping a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied , to keep it refrigerated .
this is a slightly extreme case in point but it helps illustrate the logistical challenges , in particular in resource-poor settings , of what 's required to get vaccines refrigerated and maintain the cold chain .
now , the stakes are very high .
a key attribute of our nanopatch is that the vaccine is dry , and when it 's dry it does n't need refrigeration .
within my lab we 've shown that we can keep the vaccine stored at 23 degrees celsius for more than a year without any loss in activity at all .
that 's an important improvement .
( applause ) we 're delighted about it as well .
and as a scientist , i love that and i love science .
however , as an engineer , as a biomedical engineer and also as a human being , i 'm not going to be satisfied until we 've rolled this thing out , taken it out of the lab and got it to people in large numbers and particularly the people that need it the most .
but also , papua new guinea has the world 's highest incidence of hpv , human papillomavirus , the cervical cancer [ risk factor ] .
it 's challenging , but there 's nothing else in the world i 'd rather be doing .
and as we look ahead i 'd like to share with you a thought : it 's the thought of a future where the 17 million deaths per year that we currently have due to infectious disease is a historical footnote .
and it 's a historical footnote that has been achieved by improved , radically improved vaccines .
now standing here today in front of you at the birthplace of the needle and syringe , a device that 's 160 years old , i 'm presenting to you an alternative approach that could really help make that happen — and it 's the nanopatch with its attributes of being needle-free , pain-free , the ability for removing the cold chain and improving the immunogenicity .
( applause )
this is a very dangerous , debilitating , and deadly disease .
so that 's a three-to-one return .
well , let 's think about it this way .
most importantly for this , they 're faster .
but this piece is due out in may .
at the time i made this picture , stacey was working as an attorney for the state of texas .
a few months ago , i started talking to alec about a fascination of mine .
he liked her purple hair .
so as part of this project , i thought it 'd be interesting if she tried to meet someone .
`` participants were given a list of ice- breaker questions to get the ball rolling , things like , `` '' if you could be any kind of animal , what would you be ? '' '' that sort of thing . ''
my first date was colin .
alec and i saw him at the end of the evening , and he said he 'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession stands .
we talked about running . he does triathlons , i run half-marathons .
alec actually liked his eyes and asked if i was attracted to him , but i was n't , and i do n't think he was attracted to me either .
austin and mike came together .
mike asked me a hypothetical question .
he feels a lot of women wear too much makeup , and that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have .
he thought i was lying , but i was n't .
i think he was drunk .
alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him .
i did n't feel a particular connection with any of the men that i went on dates with , and i did n't feel like they felt a particular connection with me either .
he was 30 .
he was the first person she 'd dated .
he was 18 , she was 15 .
they met at a country-western club in louisville , kentucky called the sahara .
in their case , they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets the exact same photograph .
register , for example .
he did it because he could n't afford a car , but also because he knew how to build one .
there was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made , so we could build and repair them , or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy .
for the most part , we still know what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of and how they are produced .
in the case of this little example i 'm holding , we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light .
conductive ink has been used by artists , but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens .
and thermochromic pigments change color at a given temperature .
so i 'm going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what happens .
so one of the principle applications for this material is , amongst other things , in baby bottles , so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink .
so these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials .
we may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us , but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature , keyboards that roll up , and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch .
so i 'm a social scientist by training , so why am i here today talking about smart materials ?
well first of all , because i am a maker .
i 'm curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we do n't know enough about these high-tech composites our future will be made of .
there 's barely any information available on how to use them , and very little is said about how they are produced .
so for now , they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to .
it 's a website where we , and anyone else who wants to join us , share experiments , publish information , encourage others to contribute whenever they can , and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves .
but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of ?
the objects we use , the clothes we wear , the houses we live in , all have a profound impact on our behavior , health and quality of life .
secondly , and just as important , innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers .
so many times , amateurs , not experts , have been the inventors and improvers of things ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors , personal computers , airplanes .
so jordan 's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself .
another example i 'd like to mention is hannah perner-wilson 's kit-of-no-parts .
so hannah 's approach , on the other hand , is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre-designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves .
so amongst hannah 's many impressive experiments , this is one of my favorites .
`` ( music : `` '' happy together '' '' ) so based on the research by marcelo coelho from mit , hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink . ''
so hannah 's artisanal work , and the fact that she shared her findings , opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative .
so the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity , and we are not afraid to fail .
we often tackle problems from unconventional angles , and , in the process , end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things .
so the more people experiment with materials , the more researchers are willing to share their research , and manufacturers their knowledge , the better chances we have to create technologies that truly serve us all .
thank you .
( applause )
but before i show you how all of this is possible , let 's talk briefly about why improving the quality of science education is so vitally important .
and in many ways , we all rely on them for coming up with new , great innovations to help us solve all these challenges ahead of us .
so we started looking elsewhere .
and so we thought to ourselves : why not just apply that to science ?
one group would only use the virtual laboratory simulations , the other group would only use traditional teaching methods , and they had the same amount of time .
and today , i am really excited to be presenting what we came up with and have been working incredibly hard to create .
i will explain briefly what this is .
it literally feels like i just stepped inside this virtual lab .
i can , for instance , pick up the pipette and do experiments with it .
and here , i have my learning tablet .
then over here , i have marie .
and now before i finalize this , i want to show you an even cooler thing , i think — something you can not even do in real laboratories .
and what i just did is literally shrunk myself a million times into the size of a molecule — and it really feels like it , you have to try this .
i see the polymerase and the enzymes and so forth .
and i can see how in this case , dna is being replicated millions of times , just like it 's happening inside your body right now .
and that was that he did not have access to real laboratories , because he was too inexperienced to be allowed in .
in october 2010 , the justice league of america will be teaming up with the 99 .
the books and the solution get thrown in the tigris river .
but this is not about religion , it 's not about proselytizing .
mujiba , from malaysia : her main power is she 's able to answer any question .
`` `` so when 's the article coming out ? '' ''
dana : there 's too much darkness .
dr. razem : it 's time to go , miklos .
i do n't deserve it . i do n't deserve anything .
miklos : stay away from me .
as the father of five sons , i worry about who they 're going to be using as role models .
the first one , they said saudi arabia . there was no debate .
he actually called me a meddling kid the other day .
what do we teach our children about emotional hygiene ?
`` `` oh , you 're feeling depressed ? just shake it off ; it 's all in your head . '' ''
and then you 'll be even more convinced you ca n't succeed .
you see , that 's why so many people function below their actual potential .
to ruminate means to chew over .
he had visible tumors all over his body .
we barely break even . there is no fame in it .
it 's the most powerful thing you own .
it was right on the heels of the rwandan genocide , and aid money to the region was drying up .
about 20 minutes into this conversation i was having with this one young woman , i leaned forward and tried to put my finger in the palm of her baby 's hand .
she was stiff , and her little , lifeless hand was curled into itself .
some will you tell you that war is unavoidably human .
we say never again , and yet it happens again and again and again .
do you want to know why ?
you will notice that most of those countries are in the global south .
and what do we notice ?
well , you see them in green .
and then what if we go beyond small arms for a second .
who does the biggest business ?
`` now , some of you might be saying at this moment in time , `` oh yeah , but ok , hang on a second there ... nutt . '' ''
and now let 's compare that to the number of people who have directly died in armed conflict around the world in that same period .
well , you notice that , in fact , that also goes up roughly three- to fourfold .
but we can shift that balance .
how do we do this ?
on the supply side , we can push our governments to adopt international arms transparency mechanisms like the arms trade treaty , which makes it so that rich countries have to be more accountable for where their arms are going and what their arms might be used for .
this is where we need to make our voices heard .
you know , there are generations around the world who are being lost to war .
`` and i know what it means to lie in bed in the pitch-black night and listen to that haunting `` '' pop-pop-pop-pop-pop ! '' '' of automatic gunfire , and wonder with absolute dread how many minutes i have left until it will be right on top of me . ''
and on at least a couple of occasions , war has very nearly killed me as well .
we buy it , sell it , spread it and wage it .
on the contrary , we are the only ones who can .
i want to make a case .
i bring you into a room .
and i 'm telling you , it 's not even close .
in the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management .
and they do something incredibly cool .
`` for those of you who i 'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards , you could please refrain from saying , `` oh my god , you 're so much shorter in real life . '' ''
somewhat like the curving of the universe .
tom hanks : hello , houston , this is odyssey .
and then i did kind of get the reaction i was hoping for .
everything in america is so much bigger than in europe .
look at me — i am huge !
and ted talks — ted talks are where everybody has great ideas .
that leaves us with just a five percent window of opportunity each day to actually think something new .
and here 's the thing : i 'm never going to be able to relate to that , because i 'm never going to be able to do it , ok ?
and i always feel rather smug then .
the inequalities in sport are breathtaking .
it 's a wonder men have been able to evolve quite so brilliantly .
and i did n't want them to grow up with a secret .
well , it was hell .
it was a great event .
we invited 150 family and friends , then i let it be known to the public : anybody who wanted to come and celebrate , please come and join us .
love triumphs .
and i was giving a talk in 2015 about the suffragettes — i 'm sure you know those magnificent women who fought so hard for the right for women in britain to vote .
this was something where there was so much left to do .
nowhere in the world , for example , do women have equal representation in positions of power .
top 100 companies : how many women running them ?
seven . ok. seven . that 's all right , i suppose .
nowhere in the world do women earn the same as men .
2133 !
i 've waited long enough in my own business .
is n't that great ? wonderful , i 'm thrilled .
in 2015 , the number of men elected to the parliament that year was greater than the total number of women who have ever been members of parliament .
and why does it matter ?
and this group was no different .
this team of women , in many ways , was like women everywhere .
you could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies .
and also for the men alongside whom they served .
she also loved to put 50 pounds of weight on her back and run for miles , and she loved to be a soldier .
and women can be heroes , too .
augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime , and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen , and people need to be aware of that , because augmented reality will change our lives just as much as the internet and the cell phone .
it will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field .
right now , the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you .
i have to use words .
with google glass , we can put that underneath a helmet , and we can get a sense of what it 's like to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour , your blood pounding in your ears .
and i 've been on the receiving end of that , and it does n't feel very good .
so let 's pull up some video .
hold on , let 's get a little closer .
all right , ready ?
go !
chris kluwe : so as you can see , small taste of what it 's like to get tackled on the football field from the perspective of the tacklee .
we have some video of that courtesy of the university of washington .
oh !
ck : so again , this takes you a little bit closer to what it 's like to be on that field , but this is nowhere what it 's like to be on the nfl .
`` they want to be their favorite players , and they 've already talked to me on youtube , they 've talked to me on twitter , saying , `` '' hey , can you get this on a quarterback ? ''
`` we want that experience . '' '' well , once we have that experience with gopro and google glass , how do we make it more immersive ? ''
well , we take that step by going to something called the oculus rift , which i 'm sure many of you are also familiar with .
( video ) man : oh ! oh !
they protested across britain .
or if you take eglantyne jebb , the woman who created save the children 90 years ago .
but what more could she have done if she’d had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately ?
because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations , it was impossible for that premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do .
or take burma and the monks that were blogging out , a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening , until these blogs told the world that there was a repression , meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and aung san suu kyi , who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world , had to be listened to .
150 years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people , children , had the right to education .
100 years ago in most countries in europe , the pressure was for the right to vote .
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare .
in the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism , anti-semitism , racism , apartheid , discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality ; all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world .
i was with nelson mandela a year ago , when he was in london .
i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation .
i was sitting next to nelson mandela — i was very privileged to do so — when amy winehouse came onto the stage . ( laughter ) and nelson mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and i was explaining to him at the time who she was .
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally , with the challenges that we now face , most of which are global in their nature .
climate change can not be solved in one country , but has got to be solved by the world working together .
take the problems of security and terrorism and , equally , the problem of human rights and development : they can not be solved by africa alone ; they can not be solved by america or europe alone .
one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda .
if people can find that that sub-prime product has been transferred across nations many , many times until it ends up in banks in iceland or the rest in britain , and people 's ordinary savings are affected by it , then you can not rely on a system of national supervision .
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility , not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years .
then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world , the poorest part of the world .
we do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future , and yet , out of people’s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done .
i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone .
this is a country of six and a half million people , but it has only 80 doctors ; it has 200 nurses ; it has 120 midwives .
you can not begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources .
she was 11 years old ; her parents had both died from aids , her mother and then her father .
she herself was suffering from hiv ; she was suffering from tuberculosis .
when you looked in her eyes , any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future , but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes and if i could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment , i believe that all the work that it had done for the global hiv/aids fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations .
we must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture , so that africa is not a net importer of food , but an exporter of food .
there is a photograph of a boy called david .
beside that photograph there is the information about his life .
how did he die ?
and we never did .
and that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in rwanda , and we never did .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid , but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world .
so my argument today is basically this .
we have the means by which we could create a truly global society .
the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors .
( applause )
but what is it , exactly ?
why ?
and so , that 's the clue .
we 've known about ebola since 1976 .
we 've known what it 's capable of .
it 's simply too commercially risky .
why is it that the ebola vaccine was n't fully developed at this point ?
the sad reality is , we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people , but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines .
vaccine development is expensive and complicated .
the first is to recognize when there 's a complete market failure .
by creating capabilities within countries , we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens .
the data from that then can be used to understand the geographic and genetic diversity , which then can be used to help us understand how these are being changed immunologically , and what type of reactions they promote .
and yet , we spend virtually nothing to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain as epidemic infectious diseases .
and vaccines are our best defense .
so if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like ebola , we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development and in stockpile creation .
thank you .
why not chisel a coral reef out of marble ?
and they have different properties .
mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist .
here is this diagram in crochetness .
sadly , about 40 percent of us will hear those three words within our lifetime , and half will not survive .
this means that two out of five of your closest friends and relatives will be diagnosed with some form of cancer , and one will die .
but a cancer diagnosis does n't have to be a death sentence .
and similar trends are found for colorectal and ovarian cancer .
still worse , when it comes to some forms of cancer , such as ovarian , liver or pancreatic cancer , good screening methods simply do n't exist , meaning that often people wait until physical symptoms surface , which are themselves already indicators of late-stage progression .
and this is exactly what i 've been doing .
last year however , this fight became much more personal when my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer .
i know firsthand how life-altering treatment can be , and i 'm keenly aware of the emotional havoc that cancer can wreak on a family , which in our case included our two young daughters .
my research team of engineers and biochemists is working on exactly this challenge .
we 've created a technology that we call nano-dld that is capable of precisely this : automated exosome isolation to aid rapid cancer diagnostics .
we 've come up with a different approach for achieving automated exosome isolation from a sample such as urine .
and this is exactly how our system works on a much , much smaller scale .
the idea here is that the separation process for screening could be as simple as processing a sample of urine , blood or saliva , which is a near-term possibility within the next few years .
this would make rapid diagnostics virtually painless .
i 'm also happy to report that because we caught my wife 's cancer early , her treatment was successful , and she is now , thankfully , cancer-free .
so i begin with an advertisement inspired by george orwell that apple ran in 1984 .
( video ) big brother : we are one people with one will , one resolve , one cause .
fast-forward more than two decades : apple launches the iphone in china and censors the dalai lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the chinese government for its chinese app store .
the german magazine stern , a news magazine , had its app censored because the apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users , and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout germany .
and more controversially , recently , apple censored a palestinian protest app after the israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks .
or they 're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed .
or they 're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many , or most , of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question .
but now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace .
and their decisions about software coding , engineering , design , terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and can not do with our digital lives .
and their sovereignties , cross-cutting , globally interlinked , can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation-states in very exciting ways , but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and can not do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world .
after all , even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year .
and these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in tunisia and egypt this past spring and beyond .
on the left there 's a photo taken by an egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the egyptian state security offices in march .
and many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles .
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the egyptian security forces .
and in tunisia , censorship actually began to return in may — not nearly as extensively as under president ben ali .
but you 'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence .
in protest over this , blogger slim amamou , who had been jailed under ben ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution , he resigned in protest from the cabinet .
but there 's been a lot of debate in tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem .
but the problem is , how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power ?
`` today , things are a lot more subtle . '' '' welcome to democracy , our tunisian and egyptian friends . ''
the reality is that even in democratic societies today , we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks .
in fact , in the united states , whatever you may think of julian assange , even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the united states government and some companies have handled wikileaks .
amazon webhosting dropped wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from u.s. senator joe lieberman , despite the fact that wikileaks had not been charged , let alone convicted , of any crime .
but borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace .
in brazil and japan , it 's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons .
but if you look at china , vietnam and a number of the former soviet states , what 's happening there is more troubling .
`` now in china , you have the `` '' great firewall , '' '' as it 's well-known , that blocks facebook and twitter and now google+ and many of the other overseas websites . ''
in plain english , that means censorship and surveillance of their users .
and robin li , ceo of baidu , china 's dominant search engine , was one of the recipients .
but this is a website called rospil that 's an anti-corruption site .
and earlier this year , there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to rospil through a payments processing system called yandex money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at yandex money .
so we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the internet , which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services .
so the important question , i think , is not this debate over whether the internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys .
of course , it 's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is .
because i think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens , and i would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives , not to manipulate or enslave us .
and government regulation often is n't helping all that much .
`` you have situations , for instance , in france where president sarkozy tells the ceo 's of internet companies , `` '' we 're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest . '' '' but then he goes and champions laws like the infamous `` '' three-strikes '' '' law that would disconnect citizens from the internet for file sharing , which has been condemned by the u.n. special rapporteur on freedom of expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens ' right to communications , and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens . ''
so what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric internet in the future , we need a broader and more sustained internet freedom movement .
after all , companies did n't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course , or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course , just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do .
it 's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations , and that you get the right corporate behavior .
we need to make the same approach with the internet .
we also are going to need political innovation .
this set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation , which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed — which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in america across the pond .
so now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked .
and what does that look like ?
thank you very much .
and that 's what i get to do .
so this is a new species we described , from southern indiana .
and in that time they developed these subtle differences in the genetic architecture behind their blindness .
so this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision , and at the very roots of how we can see .
so in fact , these species did n't move at all .
now , we actually do n't know this species ' closest relative , yet .
but i hope we discover this species before it goes extinct too .
thank you .
that 's right .
and of course , i could understand and relate to the feelings of white people .
he kept saying that even with the best education , i was not going to get a fair shake .
and now that i say it out loud , i realize how terrible that sounds , but be that as it may , i absolutely love them .
so on my way into the store , there was this grown white guy in the doorway blocking my way .
`` i was very confused because i was thinking , well , `` '' my white people , come on ! where are they ? what 's going on ? ''
i was spit in the face in the streets of oslo , this time by brown men .
they even tried to kidnap me at one point .
the death threats were endless .
again , i was so confused .
i 'd never felt so alone . i 'd never felt so lost .
and i was certainly not going to be killed for something that was n't even my dream — it was my father 's choice .
so i kind of got lost .
and , to my surprise , what i found was so many of these young people were suffering and struggling .
they were facing so many problems with their families and their communities who seemed to care more about their honor and their reputation than the happiness and the lives of their own kids .
maybe there are more of my people out there .
and i also realized that my silence , our silence , allows abuse like this to continue .
so i started making films , and i started telling these stories .
so the first film i made was about banaz .
she was obedient , she did whatever her parents wanted .
she tried to do everything right .
`` and when she tried to go to her family for help , they said , `` well , you got to go back and be a better wife . '' ''
the police did n't believe her so they did n't do anything .
you know ?
so i spent the next two years interviewing convicted terrorists , jihadis and former extremists .
this is what they 're doing for our young people .
i found the same feelings that i felt as a 17-year-old as i fled from norway .
the same feeling of being lost and torn between cultures .
and the reason i did that is because of my superpower .
i stopped feeling like i had to pick a side , but this took me many , many years .
and to our young people tempted by extremism , can you acknowledge that your rage is fueled by pain ?
the day after the paris attacks , a friend of mine sent this photo of her daughter .
they 're best friends .
this image is the kryptonite for extremists .
it 's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have .
two quickly became 26 .
gardening , it seems , is not just for greenhouses .
so why exhibit my work in the ocean ?
as new reefs form , a new world literally starts to evolve , a world that continuously amazes me .
fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed .
tunicates explode from the faces .
the deepest red i 've ever seen in my life lives underwater .
gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves .
and grey angelfish glide silently overhead .
and i think this is for a reason , or at least i hope it is .
what i really hope is that people are beginning to understand that when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature , that we need to start thinking about our oceans , too .
`` visitors to `` '' ocean atlas '' '' in the bahamas highlighted a leak from a nearby oil refinery . ''
entrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers to manage tourism and fishing quotas .
what do we all have in common ?
they 're places where we keep objects of great value to us , where we simply treasure them for them being themselves .
it 's simply too massive , too vast , too endless .
cancun is famous for spring break , tequila and foam parties .
clearly , it would blow your mind .
our oceans are sacred .
( applause )
joe kowan : i have stage fright .
i 've always had stage fright , and not just a little bit , it 's a big bit .
just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable .
i had this irrational fear .
well , when i got there , it was packed .
there were like 20 people there .
so you have a rush of adrenaline , your heart rate increases , your breathing gets faster .
i mean , your nervous system is an idiot .
i 'm embarrassed , the audience is clearly uncomfortable , they 're focused on my discomfort .
it was so bad .
and something good did happen — i had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that i was hoping for .
and i wanted more . but i knew i had to get past this nervousness .
that night i promised myself : i would go back every week until i was n't nervous anymore .
and that 's when i had an epiphany .
and i remember it really well , because i do n't have a lot of epiphanies . ( laughter ) all i had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness .
so i started writing a song about having stage fright .
and then accounting for things like my shaky voice , and i knew i would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal , because i was nervous .
and then i could move on , and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease .
except for when i was really nervous , like now . ( laughter ) would it be okay if i played the stage fright song for you ?
( music ) thank you .
♫ i 'm not joking , you know , ♫ ♫ this stage fright is real . ♫ ♫ and if i 'm up here trembling and singing , ♫ ♫ well , you 'll know how i feel . ♫ ♫ and the mistake i 'd be making , ♫ ♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking . ♫ ♫ as you sit there feeling embarrassed for me , ♫ ♫ well , you do n't have to be . ♫ ♫ well , maybe just a little bit . ♫ ( laughter ) ♫ and maybe i 'll try to imagine you all without clothes . ♫ ♫ but singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows . ♫
♫ not to discuss this at length , ♫ ♫ but my body image was never my strength . ♫ ♫ so frankly , i wish that you all would get dressed , ♫ ♫ i mean , you 're not even really naked . ♫ ♫ and i 'm the one with the problem . ♫ ♫ and you tell me , do n't worry so much , you 'll be great . ♫ ♫ but i 'm the one living with me ♫ ♫ and i know how i get . ♫ ♫ your advice is gentle but late . ♫ ♫ if not just a bit patronizing . ♫ ♫ and that sarcastic tone does n't help me when i sing . ♫
♫ my vocal cords movin ' , ♫ ♫ at speeds slightly faster than sound . ♫ ( applause )
now these animals are different from one another , because they have different genes .
so that suggests that somewhere in these genes , somewhere in the dna , are genes for aging , genes that allow them to have different lifespans .
so if there are genes like that , then you can imagine that , if you could change one of the genes in an experiment , an aging gene , maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan .
and if they exist and you can find them , then maybe one could eventually do something about it .
so we 've set out to look for genes that control aging .
instead , we studied a little , tiny , round worm called c. elegans , which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence .
so we started to change genes at random , looking for long-lived animals .
and we were very lucky to find that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2 doubled the lifespan of the little worm .
so you can see in black , after a month — they 're very short-lived ; that 's why we like to study them for studies of aging — in black , after a month , the normal worms are all dead .
but at that time , most of the mutant worms are still alive .
so the first thing you 're going to see is the normal worm when it 's about college student age — a young adult .
it 's quite a cute little fellow .
and next you 're going to see the long-lived mutant when it 's young .
so this animal is going to live twice as long .
it 's active . you ca n't tell the difference really .
you can see the little head moving down at the bottom there .
and if you look at the tissues of the animal , they 're starting to deteriorate .
so there 's something about aging that 's kind of universal .
one gene is changed out of 20,000 , and look at it .
it 's the same age , but it 's not in the nursing home ; it 's going skiing .
this is what 's really cool : it 's aging more slowly .
it takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day .
you would never know , until she told you .
( laughter ) okay .
and the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor .
so what you see in the picture there is a cell with a hormone receptor in red punching through the edge of the cell .
so part of it is like a baseball glove .
part of it 's on the outside , and it 's catching the hormone as it comes by in green .
and the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell .
okay , so what is the daf-2 receptor telling the inside of the cell ?
so that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor is to speed up aging .
that 's what that arrow means .
it speeds up aging . it makes it go faster .
so what kind of hormones are these ?
these hormones are similar to hormones that we have in our bodies .
now you 've all heard of at least insulin .
insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal .
so these functions were known for these hormones for a long time , but our studies suggested that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about — maybe they also affect aging .
and it 's looking like that 's the case .
so after we made our discoveries with little c. elegans , people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking , if we made the same daf-2 mutation , the hormone receptor mutation , in other animals , will they live longer ?
so it 's an ancient pathway , because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution such that it still works in all these animals .
and also , the common precursor also gave rise to people .
and there are hints of this .
and just like any population , most of the people live to be about 70 or 80 , but some live to be 90 or 100 .
and what they found was that people who lived to 90 or 100 were more likely to have daf-2 mutations — that is , changes in the gene that encodes the receptor for igf-1 .
and these changes made the gene not act as well as the normal gene would have acted .
it damaged the gene .
so those are hints suggesting that humans are susceptible to the effects of the hormones for aging .
as you age , you 're much more likely to get cancer , alzheimer 's disease , heart disease , all sorts of diseases .
it turns out that these long-lived mutants are more resistant to all these diseases .
they hardly get cancer , and when they do it 's not as severe .
so it 's really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they 're still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?
so it suggests that , if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take to replicate some of these effects in humans , maybe we would have a way of combating lots of different age-related diseases all at once .
so how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging ?
well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants , a whole lot of genes are switched on in the dna that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues , and repair damage .
so in a daf-2 mutant — you see that i have the x drawn here through the receptor .
under those conditions , the foxo protein in blue has gone into the nucleus — that little compartment there in the middle of the cell — and it 's sitting down on a gene binding to it .
and the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes , genes i call carrot-giver genes , whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well — to fold correctly and function correctly .
dna repair genes are more active in these animals .
and many of these different genes , we 've shown , actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant .
these animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do .
well when the daf-2 receptor is active , then it triggers a series of events that prevent foxo from getting into the nucleus where the dna is .
that 's how it works . that 's why we do n't see the long lifespan , until we have the daf-2 mutant .
well we think that insulin and igf-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions — in the good times — when food is plentiful and there 's not a lot of stress in the environment .
but what we think is that , under conditions of stress , the levels of these hormones drop — for example , having limited food supply .
and that 's why we think the animals live longer .
so you can think of foxo as being like a building superintendent .
so maybe he 's a little bit lazy , but he 's there , he 's taking care of the building .
so he does n't actually do anything himself .
and then the hurricane comes through , and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in .
and not only that , it can also just last longer , even if there is n't a hurricane .
so that 's the concept here for how we think this life extension ability exists .
just like we all have eyes , but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes .
and there are certain forms of the foxo gene that have found to be more frequently present in people who live to be 90 or 100 .
and that 's the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
`` and each one of these stars represents a population where scientists have asked , `` '' okay , are there differences in the type of foxo genes among people who live a really long time ? '' '' and there are . ''
we do n't know the details of how this works , but we do know then that foxo genes can impact the lifespan of people .
and that means that , maybe if we tweak it a little bit , we can increase the health and longevity of people .
a foxo is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people .
and i 'm really optimistic that this is going to work .
there are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging .
there 's one called tor , which is another nutrient sensor , like the insulin pathway .
and mutations that damage the tor gene — just like the daf-2 mutations — extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice .
and you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse — even when it 's pretty old , like age 60 for a human , that old for a mouse — if you give the mouse rapamycin , it will live longer .
now i do n't want you all to go out taking rapamycin .
it is a drug for people , but the reason is it suppresses the immune system .
thank you .
let me get this straight .
there is n't the technology to do that .
but i do n't think that 's a good idea .
and the reason is that these hormones , like the insulin and the igf hormones and the tor pathway , they 're essential .
so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .
and i think that 's much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
and also , there are other ways of activating foxo that do n't even involve insulin or igf-1 that might even be safer .
just move to one side for us , if you would .
for example , there are some tortoises called blanding 's turtles .
and the 70 year-old ones , actually they 're better at scouting out the good nesting places , and they also have more progeny every year .
and nobody knows if they really can live forever , or what keeps them from aging .
it 's not clear .
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that .
and our long-lived mutants are too .
so it could be that the pathways that i 've been talking about , which are set to run really quickly in the worm , have a different normal set point in something like a bird , so that a bird can live a lot longer .
mr : but what you 're talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death , so much as extending human youthspan .
ck : yes , that 's right .
it 's more like , say , if you were a dog .
`` you notice that you 're getting old , and you look at your human and you think , `` '' why is n't this human getting old ? '' '' they 're not getting old in the dog 's lifespan . ''
it 's more like that .
but now we 're the human looking out and imagining a different human .
they multi-task .
these groups are hybrid .
that 's a very appealing picture , however , it 's just not true .
and in many ways , it always has been .
i 'd like to share with you a story about how i 've experienced this very dramatically in my own work .
when i make an incision inside a patient 's body , it 's dark .
and this is why , traditionally , surgeries have always started so early in the morning — to take advantage of daylight hours .
for example , this is the oldest operating room in the western world , in london , where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in .
and then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in america .
this is mass general in boston .
we have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights — lights that can allow us to see what we currently do n't see .
so let me back up a little bit .
when we are in medical school , we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this where everything 's color-coded .
that 's so easy anybody could become a surgeon , right ?
however , when we have a real patient on the table , this is the same neck dissection — not so easy to tell the difference between different structures .
we heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society , what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute .
well if cancer can be caught early , enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out , excised with surgery , i do n't care if it has this gene or that gene , or if it has this protein or that protein , it 's in the jar .
it 's done , it 's out , you 're cured of cancer .
this is how we excise cancers .
in the meanwhile , the patient 's on the operating room table .
the nurses , anesthesiologist , the surgeon , all the assistants are waiting around .
and we wait .
the pathologist takes that sample , freezes it , cuts it , looks in the microscope one by one and then calls back into the room .
and that may be 20 minutes later per piece .
`` please go cut that piece out . '' '' so we go back and we do that again , and again . ''
`` and this whole process : `` '' okay you 're done . ''
`` we think the entire tumor is out . '' '' but very often several days later , the patient 's gone home , we get a phone call : `` '' i 'm sorry , once we looked at the final pathology , once we looked at the final specimen , we actually found that there 's a couple other spots where the margins are positive . ''
so would n't it be better if we could really tell , if the surgeon could really tell , whether or not there 's still cancer on the surgical field ?
i mean , in many ways , the way that we 're doing it , we 're still operating in the dark .
the molecule they had developed had three parts .
the main part of it is the blue part , polycation , and it 's basically very sticky to every tissue in your body .
so when those two are together , the molecule is neutral and nothing gets stuck down .
and the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors — for example , the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make .
can you tell where the tumor is ?
now it 's green .
we can tell in the operating room , in the field , at a molecular level , where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out .
the light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue .
so even if the tumor is not right on the surface , you 'll still be able to see it .
in this movie , you can see that the tumor is green .
and i 'm peeling that muscle away .
sentinel lymph node dissection has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer , melanoma .
women used to get really debilitating surgeries to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes .
but when sentinel lymph node came into our treatment protocol , the surgeon basically looks for the single node that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer .
and then if that node has cancer , the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection .
so what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer , the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery .
patients are still on the operating room table .
anesthesiologists , surgeons are waiting around .
that takes time .
you see a lot of little , roundish bumps there .
who amongst us has n't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold ?
well with our technology , the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer .
the patient has cancer , you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer even before you go in .
so in surgery , it 's important to know what to cut out .
and what i 'm talking about are nerves .
nerves , if they are injured , can cause paralysis , can cause pain .
that 's a lot of people to have a lot of problems — and this is even in so-called nerve-sparing surgery , which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem , and they are trying to avoid the nerves .
they are traced just by their known anatomical path along vasculature .
crazy to think that we 're having surgery , we 're trying to excise cancer , we do n't know where the cancer is .
we 're trying to preserve nerves ; we ca n't see where they are .
so i said , would n't it be great if we could find a way to see nerves with fluorescence ?
what 's the problem ?
`` we have n't had that many complications . '' '' but i went ahead anyway . ''
and roger helped me .
and he brought his whole team with him .
so there 's that teamwork thing again .
and we eventually discovered molecules that were specifically labeling nerves .
here you 're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse , and you can see that that big , fat portion you can see very easily .
you see what looks like little medusa heads coming out .
we have been able to see nerves for facial expression , for facial movement , for breathing — every single nerve — nerves for urinary function around the prostate .
we 've been able to see every single nerve .
when we put these two probes together ...
so here 's a tumor .
that white portion there is easy to see .
but what about the part that goes into the tumor ?
we published our results in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences and in nature biotechnology .
we received commentary in discover magazine , in the economist .
and we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues .
i have patients who would benefit from this .
the eventual goal is that we 'll get this into patients .
understandably , the majority of the medical industry is focused on multiple-use drugs , such as long-term daily medications .
we are focused on making this technology better .
we 're focused on adding drugs , adding growth factors , killing nerves that are causing problems and not the surrounding tissue .
we know that this can be done and we 're committed to doing it .
i 'd like to leave you with this final thought .
successful innovation is not a single breakthrough .
successful innovation is a team sport , it 's a relay race .
and this takes the long-term steady courage of the day-in day-out struggle to educate , to persuade and to win acceptance .
thank you very much .
( applause )
and you stop , and you get out of your car and you take a picture .
it 's a medical story , but more than that , it 's a social story .
and each day , a thousand babies — a thousand babies are born each day with hiv in africa .
meds do n't equal medical care .
the first , to prevent mother-to-child transmission .
so we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission .
( applause )
and it 's working .
i 've been a journalist now since i was about 17 , and it 's an interesting industry to be in at the moment , because as you all know , there 's a huge amount of upheaval going on in media , and most of you probably know this from the business angle , which is that the business model is pretty screwed , and as my grandfather would say , the profits have all been gobbled up by google .
it 's on the input side . it 's concern with how we get information and how we gather the news .
and that 's changed irrevocably .
my first connection with the news media was in 1984 , the bbc had a one-day strike .
`` and it 's a very effective way of ending your hate mail : `` '' love markham , aged 4 . '' '' still works . ''
i 'm not sure if i had any impact on the one-day strike , but what i do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me .
and that 's changed now because , as journalists , we interact in real time . we 're not in a position where the audience is reacting to news .
we 're reacting to the audience , and we 're actually relying on them .
they 're helping us find the news . they 're helping us figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear .
it was a 7.6 magnitude . it was fairly big .
so the ground shook in managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter .
it 's actually staggering . when you look at the numbers , every minute there are 72 more hours of video on youtube .
more than three and a half thousand photos go up onto facebook .
the only problem is , when you have that much information , you have to find the good stuff , and that can be incredibly difficult when you 're dealing with those volumes .
and nowhere was this brought home more than during hurricane sandy . so what you had in hurricane sandy was a superstorm , the likes of which we had n't seen for a long time , hitting the iphone capital of the universe — ( laughter ) — and you got volumes of media like we 'd never seen before .
we had to deal with composite images that were merging photos from previous storms .
but joking aside , there were images like this one from instagram which was subjected to a grilling by journalists .
they were n't really sure . it was filtered in instagram .
it 's like the de facto real-time newswire , if you know how to use it , because there is so much on twitter .
and a good example of how useful it can be but also how difficult was the egyptian revolution in 2011 .
as a non-arabic speaker , as someone who was looking from the outside , from dublin , twitter lists , and lists of good sources , people we could establish were credible , were really important .
well , it can be quite difficult , but you have to know what to look for .
`` you could find the nodes , though , and then you went , and you go , `` '' right , i 've got to investigate these people . ''
these are the ones that are obviously making sense .
sometimes you come across a piece of content that is so compelling , you want to use it , you 're dying to use it , but you 're not 100 percent sure if you can because you do n't know if the source is credible .
you know ? this is a fantastic reaction from someone , very genuine video that they 've shot in their back garden .
and we did n't know if rita existed or if it was a fake name .
but we started looking , and we used free internet tools to do so .
the first one was called spokeo , which allowed us to look for rita krills .
so we looked all over the u.s. we found them in new york , we found them in pennsylvania , nevada and florida .
and we found a house with a swimming pool that looked remarkably like rita 's . so we went back to the video , and we had to look for clues that we could cross-reference .
little bit of trickery . and there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool .
so we were able to call rita , clear the video , make sure that it had been shot , and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried .
sometimes the search for truth , though , is a little bit less flippant , and it has much greater consequences .
syria has been really interesting for us , because obviously a lot of the time you 're trying to debunk stuff that can be potentially war crime evidence , so this is where youtube actually becomes the most important repository of information about what 's going on in the world .
so this video , i 'm not going to show you the whole thing , because it 's quite gruesome , but you 'll hear some of the sounds .
this is from hama .
video : ( shouting ) and what this video shows , when you watch the whole thing through , is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck and thrown off a bridge .
the allegations were that these guys were muslim brotherhood and they were throwing syrian army officers ' bodies off the bridge , and they were cursing and using blasphemous language , and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were , and whether or not they were what the video said it was .
three different sources said three different things about the bridge .
another one said the bridge does exist , but it 's not in hama . it 's somewhere else .
`` and the third one said , `` '' i think the bridge does exist , but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed , so the river should actually have been dry , so this does n't make sense . '' '' so that was the only one that gave us a clue . ''
we saw the distinctive railings , which we could use .
we looked at the curbs . the curbs were throwing shadows south , so we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river .
that 's blood in the river . so the river is flowing south to north . that 's what that tells me .
and also , as you look away from the bridge , there 's a divot on the left-hand side of the bank , and the river narrows .
so onto google maps we go , and we start looking through literally every single bridge .
we 're looking for one that crosses east-west .
and we get to hama . we get all the way from the dam to hama and there 's no bridge .
so we go a bit further . we switch to the satellite view , and we find another bridge , and everything starts to line up .
the bridge looks like it 's crossing the river east to west .
so this could be our bridge . and we zoom right in .
we start to see that it 's got a median , so it 's a two-lane bridge .
`` so what does that tell me ? i 've got to go back now to my three sources and look at what they told me : the one who said the bridge did n't exist , the one who said the bridge was n't in hama , and the one guy who said , `` '' yes , the bridge does exist , but i 'm not sure about the water levels . '' '' number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden , and we 've been able to find that out using some free internet tools sitting in a cubicle in an office in dublin in the space of 20 minutes . ''
and that 's part of the joy of this . although the web is running like a torrent , there 's so much information there that it 's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day , if you use them intelligently , you can find out incredible information .
but what it tells me is that , at a time when there 's more — there 's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been , it 's harder to filter , we have greater tools .
we have free internet tools that allow us , help us do this kind of investigation .
we have algorithms that are smarter than ever before , and computers that are quicker than ever before .
truth is never binary . truth is a value .
truth is emotional , it 's fluid , and above all , it 's human .
no matter how quick we get with computers , no matter how much information we have , you 'll never be able to remove the human from the truth-seeking exercise , because in the end , it is a uniquely human trait .
thanks very much . ( applause )
my name is emiliano salinas and i 'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now .
i was born in 1976 .
as a child , i had a pretty normal life : i would go to school , play with my friends and cousins .
but then my father became president of mexico and my life changed .
what i 'm about to say , at least some of what i 'm about to say , will cause controversy .
and secondly , because what i 'm going to say is true , and it will make a lot of people nervous because it 's something we do n't want to hear .
but it 's imperative that we listen because it 's undeniable and definitive .
i 'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon , and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence .
i think we have a problem in mexico .
we have a big problem .
no one argues — we all agree there 's a problem .
corruption ? poverty ? or is it something else ?
the real problem we have is most of us mexicans , we believe we are victims of our circumstances .
then we were victims of don porfirio .
then we were victims of the pri .
even of salinas .
and of el peje .
what if none of these things is the problem ?
the problem is that we play the role of victims .
we need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims .
i 'm going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence , from weakest to strongest .
the first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy .
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .
it 's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it 's the flu and it will just go away .
we want to pretend that mexico has the flu .
but it does n't .
and if we do n't do something about it , the cancer will end up killing it .
but , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
and we 're acting out of that fear .
and let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear — and this is the second level of civil response : fear .
let 's think about mexican streets : they 're unsafe because of violence , so people stay at home .
does that make streets more or less safe ?
less safe !
so streets become more desolate and unsafe , so we stay home more — which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe , and we stay home even more .
this vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses , scared to death — even more afraid than when we were out on the streets .
we need to move mexican society , the members of society who are at this level , to the next level , which is action .
for many people , acting involves courage .
`` they say , `` '' i ca n't take it anymore . ''
usually it 's one or two a year .
if i 'm violent with you and you respond with violence , you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence .
so civil action is vital , but it 's also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level , which is non-violent action .
it 's pacific , coordinated civil action , which does n't mean passive action .
it means it 's determined and effective , but not violent .
two years ago , in galena city , chihuahua , a member of the community was kidnapped , eric le barón .
his brothers , benjamín and julián , got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action : to pay the ransom , to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help .
in the end , benjamín and julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .
so what did they do ?
they mobilized the whole community of le barón to go to chihuahua , where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city .
this is an example of what an organized society can do , a society that acts .
and in this case , they did .
but he keeps fighting .
he keeps organizing .
these heroic acts are present all over the country .
with a thousand juliáns working together , mexico would be a very different country .
and they 're out there !
they just have to raise their hands .
i was born in mexico , i grew up in mexico and along the way , i learned to love mexico .
i think anyone who has stepped foot on this land — not to mention all mexican people — will agree that it 's not difficult to love mexico .
i 've traveled a lot and nowhere else have i found the passion mexicans have .
that devotion we show in helping victims of disasters , such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year 's floods .
i think the biggest insult , the worst way you can offend a mexican is to insult their mother .
mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children .
what are we going to do ?
we 're facing a very powerful opponent .
they can take a man 's life .
`` he said , `` '' count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor , and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living . '' '' thank you . ''
( applause )
but let 's say for a moment that you were .
`` there 's a `` '' proceed to checkout '' '' icon . ''
that 's important .
`` `` '' dear drugsheaven , '' '' i wrote , via the internal emailing system that 's also encrypted , of course . ''
`` `` i 'm new here . do you mind if i buy just one gram of marijuana ? '' ''
they always reply .
let 's take the payment system .
check grams , the search engine .
one vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine .
facebook has started a dark net site .
that 's good news if you care about liberty .
neither entirely dark , nor entirely light .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and for the last little while , i 've been a model .
this is the first outfit change on the ted stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , i think .
not everybody gets to do that .
these heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing i was n't going to wear them .
that was awkward .
i just totally transformed what you thought of me , in six seconds .
and of course , barring surgery , or the fake tan that i got two days ago for work , there 's very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is superficial and immutable , has a huge impact on our lives .
and here 's me today .
thank you .
and in a lot of ways , this is how you would master a lot of things in life .
even the a student , what was the five percent they did n't know ?
even though we 've identified the gaps , the whole class will then move on to the next subject , probably a more advanced subject that 's going to build on those gaps .
and that process continues , and you immediately start to realize how strange this is .
but what was really broken was the process .
instead of artificially constraining , fixing when and how long you work on something , pretty much ensuring that variable outcome , the a , b , c , d , f — do it the other way around .
we have the tools to do it .
they can go into simulations , socratic dialogue .
`` and i suspect that if you asked someone who did know how to read , say a member of the clergy , `` what percentage of the population do you think is even capable of reading ? '' ''
`` and this is n't even just a `` '' nice to have . '' '' i think it 's a social imperative . ''
we 're exiting what you could call the industrial age and we 're going into this information revolution .
and it 's clear that some things are happening .
in the middle of the pyramid , you had an information processing , a bureaucracy class , and at the top of the pyramid , you had your owners of capital and your entrepreneurs and your creative class .
and so , i 'm pretty optimistic about it .
thank you .
it really goes beyond distinction .
it would have the interdisciplinarity of the ted conference .
the membrane is translucent .
it 's made of silcon-coated glass fiber .
it 's hoisted .
and then it 's restrained with the cables .
and we said , well the first erection would take one week .
i was basically concerned about what was going on in the world .
i was told i was dyslexic .
and at that point , i read a book by frank barnaby , this wonderful nuclear physicist , and he said that media had a responsibility , that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward .
and that fascinated me , because i 'd been messing around with a camera most of my life .
maybe i could become a filmmaker .
so i started thinking about peace , and i was obviously , as i said to you , very much moved by these images , trying to make sense of that .
because it 's obviously incredibly frightening .
but i realized that , having been messing around with structure as an actor , that a series of sound bites in itself was n't enough , that there needed to be a mountain to climb , there needed to be a journey that i had to take .
is that a responsible thing to do ? etc. , etc .
and that was when i had the idea .
and we started writing letters to everybody .
how do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day , the 21st of september ?
and i wanted it to be the 21st of september because it was my granddad 's favorite number .
he was a prisoner of war .
and we wrote to heads of state , their ambassadors , nobel peace laureates , ngos , faiths , various organizations — literally wrote to everybody .
one of the first letters was from the dalai lama .
and of course we did n't have the money ; we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [ this mail ] .
`` a letter came through from the dalai lama saying , `` '' this is an amazing thing . come and see me . ''
`` could you give me a flight ? because we 're going to go see him . '' '' and of course , we went and saw him and it was amazing . ''
and then dr. oscar arias came forward .
and actually , let me go back to that slide , because when we launched it in 1999 — this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence — we invited thousands of people .
there were 114 people there — they were mostly my friends and family .
and that was kind of like the launch of this thing .
but it did n't matter because we were documenting , and that was the thing .
it was n't about the end result .
and that 's the beautiful thing about the camera .
and here you see people like mary robinson , i went to see in geneva .
( laughter ) yeah , i 'm not worried about it now .
i met mandela at the arusha peace talks , and so on and so on and so on — while i was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense .
and then we were listening to the people . we were documenting everywhere .
76 countries in the last 12 years , i 've visited .
i 've recorded 44,000 young people .
i 've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts .
i 'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry , their art , their literature , their music , their sport , whatever it might be .
and it was an incredibly thing , working with the u.n .
and working with ngos and building this case .
and it was this stuff , this , where i actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened , it did n't actually matter .
the fact is that , if i tried and it did n't work , then i could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite — until , it was in somalia , picking up that young girl .
`` and that actually , at that moment something happened to me , which obviously made me go , `` '' i 'm going to document . ''
`` if this is the only film that i ever make , i 'm going to document until this becomes a reality . '' '' because we 've got to stop , we 've got to do something where we unite — separate from all the politics and religion that , as a young person , is confusing me . ''
i do n't know how to get involved in that process .
( applause ) yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality .
`` and now i was thinking , `` '' well , the press it really going to hear this story . '' '' and suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day . ''
kofi annan invited me on the morning of september the 11th to do a press conference .
and i was waiting for him to come down , and i knew that he was on his way .
and obviously he never came down . the statement was never made .
the world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence .
it never happened .
and we have to make this day work .
it 's been created ; nobody knows .
`` but we have to continue this journey , and we have to tell people , and we have to prove it can work . '' '' and i left new york freaked , but actually empowered . ''
and i felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did , then maybe we would n't see things like that .
i was showing the film , and i remember being in israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film — that it 's just a day of peace , it does n't mean anything .
it 's not going to work ; you 're not going to stop the fighting in afghanistan ; the taliban wo n't listen , etc. , etc .
it 's just symbolism .
and that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways , because it could n't not work .
`` i 'd spoken in somalia , burundi , gaza , the west bank , india , sri lanka , congo , wherever it was , and they 'd all tell me , `` '' if you can create a window of opportunity , we can move aid , we can vaccinate children . ''
children can lead their projects .
`` they can unite . they can come together . if people would stop , lives will be saved . '' '' that 's what i 'd heard . ''
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously , i 'm delighted that this man , ahmad fawzi , one of my heroes and mentors really , he managed to get unicef involved .
`` and unicef , god bless them , they said , `` '' okay , we 'll have a go . '' '' and then unama became involved in afghanistan . ''
it was historical . could it work in afghanistan with unama and who and civil society , etc. , etc. , etc . ?
`` and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it , and i was thinking , `` '' this is it . this is the possibility of it maybe working . ''
because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there 'd be more — when we got into certain areas , maybe there would be more people interested .
`` so i said to him , `` '' do you want to come with me ? ''
it 'd be really interesting if you came .
so these guys were absolutely crucial .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
`` it was a really incredible thing that when we landed there , i was talking to various people , and they were saying to me , `` '' you 've got to get everybody involved here . ''
`` you ca n't just expect it to work . you have to get out and work . '' '' and we did , and we traveled around , and we spoke to elders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nurses , we held press conferences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with isaf , we sat down with nato , we sat down with the u.k . government . ''
i mean , we basically sat down with everybody — in and out of schools with ministers of education , holding these press conferences , which of course , now were loaded with press , everybody was there .
there was an interest in what was going on .
this amazing woman , fatima gailani , was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians .
and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
and then we went home . we 'd sort of done it .
we had to wait now and see what happened .
`` and that letter basically said , `` '' we 'll observe this day . ''
we will observe this day .
we see it as a window of opportunity .
`` and we will not engage . we 're not going to engage . '' '' and that meant that humanitarian workers would n't be kidnapped or killed . ''
and then suddenly , i obviously knew at this point , there was a chance .
and days later , 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping .
we put it into dari and pashto . we put it in the local dialects .
they were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it , etc. , etc . — and they made it real .
`` and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say , `` '' look , you guys made this possible . and thank you very much . '' '' and we gave the film over . ''
obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
and that completely blew my mind almost more than anything .
and i remember being stuck in new york , this time because of the volcano , which was obviously much less harmful .
70 percent reduction in violence — in what everyone said was completely impossible and you could n't do .
we have to go for a global truce .
and we will utilize all kinds of things — have a dance and social media and visiting on facebook and visit the website , sign the petition .
and it 's in the six official languages of the united nations .
and we 'll globally link with government , inter-government , non-government , education , unions , sports .
and you can see the education box there .
why do n't you support the process of the largest ever global truce ?
on the day of peace , there 's thousands of football matches all played , from the favelas of brazil to wherever it might be .
and ultimately , we have to try that .
and when i stand here in front of all of you , and the people who will watch these things , i 'm excited , on behalf of everybody i 've met , that there is a possibility that our world could unite , that we could come together as one , that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues , brought about by individuals .
i was with brahimi , ambassador brahimi .
`` is this possible ? is it really possible that we could do this ? '' '' he said , `` '' it 's absolutely possible . '' '' i said , `` '' what would you do ? ''
`` would you go to governments and lobby and use the system ? '' '' he said , `` '' no , i 'd talk to the individuals . '' '' it 's all about the individuals . ''
it 's all about you and me .
it 's about your constituencies ; it 's about your businesses .
because together , by working together , i seriously think we can start to change things .
`` and there 's a wonderful man sitting in this audience , and i do n't know where he is , who said to me a few days ago — because i did a little rehearsal — and he said , `` '' i 've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares , and one of them is white . '' '' and it then made me think about a glass of water , which is clear . ''
if you put one drop , one drop of something , in that water , it 'll change it forever .
by working together , we can create peace one day .
thank you ted . thank you .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
but as we age , our organs tend to fail more .
we 've talked about stem cells tonight .
salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate .
so , salamanders can do it .
and you see that it is injured .
you now have your fully seeded scaffold .
we exercise these prior to implantation .
and then the most complex are the solid organs .
this is actually a simple solid organ like the ear .
you can see , actually that 's a fluoroscopy .
so , we stack these wafers together , using the kidney cells .
and then you can see these miniature kidneys that we 've engineered .
she had a spina bifida defect , a spinal cord abnormality .
video : kaitlyn m : i 'm happy . i was always afraid that i was going to have like , an accident or something .
one man died after working a 36-hour shift .
a no-brainer .
this is offshore .
companies did n't feel it was their responsibility .
they do n't own those facilities .
multinationals are protecting human rights .
it starts with just giving people back their dignity .
around 1850 , one of the biggest u.s. industries was whaling .
the question is , who will make them ?
and that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel .
but these objections are now vanishing through advances in materials .
for example , we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods .
the plant also gets smaller .
and here are some no-brainer substitutions of it , with lots left over .
or wait to capture the second half of it .
you 're not paid to change size class .
the same for gps .
the same for the modern semi-conductor industry .
but all the places we get stuck in really have great views .
harry butler is a precursor , if you like , to the late steve irwin .
when i asked him about what the solution to the problem might be , the answer was quite surprising .
and i turned to the web to see if there might be some clues .
is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to consider and define ?
i wanted to test this idea .
on the doorstep here , with the oceans institute .
so what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the west australian state government .
and we did three key things .
the next thing we did was to understand , using complex computer modeling , what that eye can see at different depths , distances , light conditions , and water clarity in the ocean .
and here 's an example of one of the first drawings .
`` so this is what i call a `` '' do n't eat me '' '' wetsuit . ''
you can see that dark , opaque panel on the front , and it 's particularly better for the surface , where being backlit and providing a silhouette is problematic .
and this one 's particularly well-suited to the dive configuration , so when you 're deeper under the water .
so we knew that we had some really solid science here .
we knew , if you wanted to stand out , you needed to look stripy , and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic , you needed to look like this .
we 're ethically precluded from even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water .
so here we 've got a four-meter tiger shark engaging the black control rig , which it had encountered about a minute and a half before .
in contrast to the sams technology rig , this is the banded one , where it 's more tactile , it 's more investigative , it 's more apprehensive , and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go .
it 'll be an ongoing process .
it 's subject to peer review and subject to publication .
we 'll license others to do that .
( applause ) and eduardo . ( applause )
cheers .
and this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .
and it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants .
my mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
can you imagine ? it 's very symbolic .
because every generation thinks we are the final one .
but sometimes , like today , we fall , we fall so fast , so fast to shadow , we fall so fast to barbaria .
there is different type of barbaria .
the behavior of the system as a whole can not be predicted from the individual rules only .
as aristotle wrote , the whole is greater than the sum of its parts .
in the beginning , the system is disorganized .
then comes a perturbation : milk .
every individual starts pushing in one direction and this is what happens .
the pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction .
i call this simplifying complexity , and it 's what we do at the chair of systems design at eth zurich .
so again , the whole is greater than the sum of the parts .
in a way , collaboration is another example of a complex system .
it was very , very complicated , but it worked beautifully in our test room , and on demo day , professors had assembled to grade the project .
so we took er-1 to the evaluation room .
it turned out , the light in that room was slightly different .
at the first bend in the line , it left its course , and crashed into a wall .
and i decided that , in fact , i did n't really want to create complicated stuff .
bechstein 's bats are a common species of european bats .
and they live in maternity colonies , which means that every spring , the females meet after the winter hibernation , and they stay together for about six months to rear their young , and they all carry a very small chip , which means that every time one of them enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes , we know where she is , and more importantly , we know with whom she is .
so i study roosting associations in bats , and this is what it looks like .
during the day , the bats roost in a number of sub-groups in different boxes .
it could be that on one day , the colony is split between two boxes , but on another day , it could be together in a single box , or split between three or more boxes , and that all seems rather erratic , really .
it 's called fission-fusion dynamics , the property for an animal group of regularly splitting and merging into different subgroups .
so what we do is take all these data from all these different days and pool them together to extract a long-term association pattern by applying techniques with network analysis to get a complete picture of the social structure of the colony .
okay ? so that 's what this picture looks like .
in this network , all the circles are nodes , individual bats , and the lines between them are social bonds , associations between individuals .
this bat colony is organized in two different communities which can not be predicted from the daily fission-fusion dynamics .
with a brain the size of a peanut , they maintain individualized , long-term social bonds , we did n't know that was possible .
so how could it be that the bats maintain this complex , stable social structure with such limited cognitive abilities ?
and this is where complexity brings an answer .
to understand this system , we built a computer model of roosting , based on simple , individual rules , and simulated thousands and thousands of days in the virtual bat colony .
simple , individual rules .
instead , it formed a single , cohesive social unit , which allowed the colony to survive that season and thrive again in the next two years .
this is where meerkats live .
there is one dominant pair , and many subordinates , some acting as sentinels , some acting as babysitters , some teaching pups , and so on .
what we do is put very small gps collars on these animals to study how they move together , and what this has to do with their social structure .
and there 's a very interesting example of collective movement in meerkats .
but the meerkats have to cross it to get from one feeding place to another .
moving meerkats are like random particles whose unique rule is one of alignment .
they simply move together .
i would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species .
in fact , the dominant female is extremely important for the cohesion of the group .
so this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response .
these meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic that is thousands of generations old , and they 're adapting it to a modern risk , in this case a road built by humans .
they adapt very simple rules , and the resulting complex behavior allows them to resist human encroachment into their natural habitat .
in the end , it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash , or it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road , or it may be another species .
thank you .
( applause ) dania gerhardt : thank you very much , nicolas , for this great start . little bit nervous ?
you brought some examples : the females are the social ones , the females are the dominant ones , i 'm not sure who thinks how .
but is it okay to do these associations ?
are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard that can be valid across all species ?
np : well , i would say there are also counter-examples to these stereotypes .
and the lesson is that it 's often difficult , and sometimes even a bit dangerous , to draw parallels between humans and animals .
thank you , nicolas perony .
there are also real business benefits .
william kamkwamba : thanks .
wk : this is my home . this is where i live .
ca : where ? what country ?
wk : in malawi , kasungu . in kasungu . yeah , mala .
ca : ok. now , you 're 19 now ?
wk : i wanted to make a windmill .
wk : yeah .
ca : so what did you do ? how did you realize that ?
`` wk : after i dropped out of school , i went to library , and i read a book that would — `` '' using energy , '' '' and i get information about doing the mill . ''
wk : ah , no . i just — ca : what happened ?
wk : in fact , a design of the windmill that was in the book , it has got four — ah — three blades , and mine has got four blades .
wk : yeah .
ca : and you made it out of what ?
wk : i made four blades , just because i want to increase power .
wk : yeah . i test .
what materials did you use ?
wk : i use a bicycle frame , and a pulley , and plastic pipe , what then pulls — ca : do we have a picture of that ? can we have the next slide ?
wk : yeah . the windmill .
ca : wow .
( applause ) ca : next slide — so who 's that ?
wk : this is my parents , holding the radio .
ca : so what did they make of — that you were 14 , 15 at the time — what did they make of this ? they were impressed ?
ca : and so what 's your — what are you going to do with this ?
wk : um — ca : what do you — i mean — do you want to build another one ?
wk : yeah , i want to build another one — to pump water and irrigation for crops .
ca : so this one would have to be bigger ?
ca : how big ?
wk : i think it will produce more than 20 the watts .
wk : yeah .
ca : wow . and so you 're talking to people here at ted to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream ?
ca : and as you think of your life going forward , you 're 19 now , do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy ?
ca : wow . william , it 's a real honor to have you at the ted conference .
( applause )
maybe it 's actually us that 's designed badly .
and so this is why we turned to these guys here .
we make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts .
it does n't look like much — in fact , it is n't like much .
but very quickly , the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food .
here 's felix , i think . he 's our alpha male ; he 's a kind of big guy .
do the monkeys do anything like this ?
and that 's what the monkey can for a single token .
most people say , why should i be risky when i can get 1,500 dollars for sure ?
this seems like a good bet . i 'm going to go with that .
for a big bonus , now they get three .
so , you know , a little bad — sorry , sorry , sorry .
we wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from .
but what we 've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that .
i did n't have to try to flap my wings .
it 's a movement that — it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone , not just scientists and people in government labs .
we make things grow .
there were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion .
let me show you what you could do right now .
the price he quoted was outrageous .
it was less than i would pay for a bar of chocolate at home .
so i clambered into his trishaw , and he began pedaling us slowly between palaces and pagodas .
and as he did , he told me how he had come to the city from his village .
he 'd earned a degree in mathematics .
there were broken shacks all around .
i could get mugged or drugged or something worse .
and then he leaned down , and reached under his bed .
i waited to see what he would pull out .
and finally he extracted a box .
so when we said goodbye that night , i realized he had also shown me the secret point of travel , which is to take a plunge , to go inwardly as well as outwardly to places you would never go otherwise , to venture into uncertainty , ambiguity , even fear .
at home , it 's dangerously easy to assume we 're on top of things .
but at some point , knowledge gives out .
i do n't believe that ignorance is bliss .
the opposite of knowledge , in other words , is n't always ignorance .
possibility .
and in my life , i 've found it 's the things i do n't know that have lifted me up and pushed me forwards much more than the things i do know .
it 's also the things i do n't know that have often brought me closer to everybody around me .
`` `` when are we ever going to get world peace ? '' ''
`` `` what 's the best way to raise children ? '' ''
the nobel prize-winning economist daniel kahneman has spent more than 60 years now researching human behavior , and his conclusion is that we are always much more confident of what we think we know than we should be .
most of the time , we 're in the dark .
do you want to know ?
they grew embarrassed and fretful , self-conscious .
and i took my first real trip to japan for two-and-a-half weeks , and i came back with a 40-page essay explaining every last detail about japan 's temples , its fashions , its baseball games , its soul .
knowledge is a priceless gift .
thinking that you know your lover or your enemy can be more treacherous than acknowledging you 'll never know them .
thank you .
the internet of today is a platform for computation .
i mean , think about wall street .
institutions are becoming naked , and if you 're going to be naked , well , there 's some corollaries that flow from that .
sunlight is the best disinfectant .
so this is a time of great change .
the printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge .
now , what i 'd like to do is , to close , to share with you some research that i 've been doing .
now , this thing has a function .
could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge ?
and i think that that 's quite a powerful thought .
so we have a choice .
alternatively , we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem .
but the choice that we do n't have is a no climate change future .
but dangerous climate change can be subjective .
and then in 2012 , we had the rio+20 event .
most of our planet is actually made up of the sea .
now , because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land , the average temperatures over land are actually going to be higher than they are over the sea .
this will be absolutely devastating for global food security .
so back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees .
is it reasonable still to focus on the two-degree path ?
and that tells us something about these trajectories .
we also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system .
but if we do n't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term , then we will have to do that even sooner .
so this poses really big challenges for us .
this is a really difficult message to take , because what it suggests is that we really need to do things differently .
i did n't care for it ; it was too painful .
so here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head or a machete wound , for example .
that 's right , six as well .
all put in that grave .
and go to countries like haiti and the congo .
is not something that 's the same or fungible among people .
what characterizes them is decentralized authority .
it 's creating , and it 's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition .
you have a belief : stuff will flow out of connected human beings .
thank you .
you 're the chaplain .
`` and i even asked him . i said , `` '' hey , how come you never bring a friend with you ? '' '' and he said , `` '' i do n't really have any friends . '' '' but he had tons of friends on the infusion floor . ''
no movement , no growth .
which i used to think meant not entirely dead .
people were taking care of her for a change .
( applause )
why did you bring this up ?
( applause )
throughout the history of computers we 've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild .
but i wondered , what if there could be no boundary at all ?
i started to imagine what this would look like .
designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3d , and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen .
how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines , words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window .
so in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world .
taking this idea further , i started to think , instead of just seeing these pixels in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it ?
at mit media lab , along with my advisor hiroshi ishii and my collaborator rehmi post , we created this one physical pixel .
what we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies .
and by digitally programming the object , we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space , which means that now , human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world .
students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion , physics , and unlike computer screens or textbooks , this is a real , tangible experience that you can touch and feel , and it 's very powerful .
today , we started by talking about the boundary , but if we remove this boundary , the only boundary left is our imagination .
he can make it out of sheer nothingness , creation ex nihilo .
recording : okay , here 's something .
i do n't live there .
i approached my time in each whitopia like an anthropologist .
i also went fishing .
but it was n't all fun .
so what 's a resident to do to fit in ?
i hit the gun club .
when i rented a gun , the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind , until i showed him my new york city driver 's license .
that 's when he got nervous .
i 'm not as bad a shot as i thought i might have been .
what i learned from north idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around .
and in that notepad i counted more confederate flags than black people .
so i decided to crash it .
in georgia , i stayed in an exurb north of atlanta .
and i learned in whitopia how a country can have racism without racists .
`` one of the whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying : `` '' one black man is a delightful dinner guest ; 50 black men is a ghetto . '' '' one of the big contexts animating my whitopian journey was the year 2042 . ''
by 2042 , white people will no longer be the american majority .
i ventured on my two-year , 27,000 mile journey to learn where , why , and how white people are fleeing , but i did n't expect to have so much fun on my journey .
i do n't expect i 'll be living in a whitopia — or a blacktopia , for that matter .
as a photographer for national geographic , i 've portrayed it for many .
but five years ago , i went on a personal journey .
it 's the hardest thing i 've ever attempted , and there have been plenty of times when i felt like backing out .
but there were also revelations .
and one of those i 'd like to share with you today .
going down there was like entering a time capsule , and i came out with a different sense of myself in time .
the oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today .
and with that said , i 'd like to invite you for a short , brief journey of life through time .
our journey starts in space , where matter condenses into spheres over time ...
solidifying into surface , molded by fire .
the fire gave way , earth emerged — but this was an alien planet .
water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the earth .
but this planet is different — it 's roiling inside .
and where that energy touches water , something new emerges : life .
circuit boards of the future .
it learned to move and began to see . the first eyes grew on trilobites .
vision was refined in horseshoe crabs , among the first to leave the sea .
scorpions follow prey out of the sea . slugs became snails .
fish tried amphibian life . frogs adapted to deserts .
lichens arose as a co-op . fungi married algae ...
clinging to rock , and eating it too ... transforming barren land .
true land plants arose , leafless at first .
once they learn how to stay upright , they grew in size and shape .
life flourished in swamps .
on land , life turned a corner . jaws formed first ; teeth came later .
and the dragons that arose are still among us today .
forests arose and nurtured things with wings .
one early form left an imprint , like it died only yesterday .
in birds , life gained new mobility .
water lilies were among the first .
plants began to diversify and grew , turning into trees .
tropical rainforests arose , sparking new layers of interdependence .
co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever .
kiwis are , and so are these hawks trapped near antarctica .
extinction can come slowly , but sometimes it arrives fast .
but there were witnesses , survivors in the dark .
a world fit for mammals . from tiny shrews [ came ] tenrecs , accustomed to the dark .
new predators , hyenas , getting faster and faster still .
herd safety came with sharpened senses .
growing big was another answer , but size always comes at a price .
some mammals turned back to water .
and cetaceans moved into a world without bounds .
there are many ways to be a mammal . a 'roo hops in oz ; a horse runs in asia ; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in brazil .
we 're molded by the same life force .
and our brains — our celebrated brains — reflect a drainage of a tidal marsh .
life is a force in its own right . it is a new element .
and where water is liquid , it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll — and that molecular marvel is what 's made a difference — it powers everything .
the whole animal world today lives on a stockpile of bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly through plants and algae , and their waste is our breath , and vice versa .
usually not more than two kilometers in width .
they do n't understand .
we do n't want something to happen that they are forced to migrate without having been prepared to do so .
later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally .
i saw them , there was this lady with red teeth .
every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text .
and playboy is always in the top few .
it 's a military operations on urbanized terrain site .
it runs 24 hours a day , commercial free .
he served seven years of a 70 year sentence in kentucky .
and of course that 's a highly competitive space .
you guys know the show ?
now , the question of course is , what happened here ?
does anyone here know the company multi-health systems ?
in 2009 , google announced that they were able , with data analysis , to predict outbreaks of influenza , the nasty kind of flu , by doing data analysis on their google searches .
`` and it worked beautifully , and it made a big splash in the news , including the pinnacle of scientific success : a publication in the journal `` '' nature . '' '' it worked beautifully for year after year after year , until one year it failed . ''
so whenever you 're solving a complex problem , you 're doing essentially two things .
you put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion .
it 's not suited to put those pieces back together again and then to come to a conclusion .
`` they use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise would n't have been able to understand at that depth , but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back together again and make a show like `` '' house of cards , '' '' that was nowhere in the data . ''
ted sarandos and his team made that decision to license that show , which also meant , by the way , that they were taking a pretty big personal risk with that decision .
and i find that a very encouraging message , in fact , that even in the face of huge amounts of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you 're doing and take risks .
thank you .
it will be despairing hostility .
this is a call center . notice how it 's decorated .
okay , got it . i do n't want to talk stage one .
the story that i like to end with is this . it comes out of a place called the gallup organization .
it was then i read the testimony that abed gave the morning after the crash , of driving down the right lane of a highway toward jerusalem .
was i what had been done to me ?
i did not want to recap the crash with abed .
i told him only that he had killed one man , not two .
so since i was here last in '06 , we discovered that global climate change is turning out to be a pretty serious issue , so we covered that fairly extensively in skeptic magazine .
we investigate all kinds of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies , but it turns out we do n't have to worry about any of this because the world 's going to end in 2012 .
another update : you will recall i introduced you guys to the quadro tracker .
it 's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around .
and you walk around , and it points to things .
oh , sorry . ( laughter ) this particular one that was given to me finds golf balls , especially if you 're at a golf course and you check under enough bushes .
`` it 's just like this one , completely worthless , in which it allegedly worked by `` '' electrostatic magnetic ion attraction , '' '' which translates to `` '' pseudoscientific baloney '' '' — would be the nice word — in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good , but it does absolutely nothing . ''
so there is a danger to pseudoscience , in believing in this sort of thing .
and in fact , i think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things .
belief is natural ; disbelief , skepticism , science , is not natural .
it 's uncomfortable to not believe things .
`` so like fox mulder on `` '' x-files , '' '' who wants to believe in ufos ? well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains . ''
and sometimes a really is connected to b , and that 's called association learning .
we find patterns , we make those connections , whether it 's pavlov 's dog here associating the sound of the bell with the food , and then he salivates to the sound of the bell , or whether it 's a skinnerian rat , in which he 's having an association between his behavior and a reward for it , and therefore he repeats the behavior .
in fact , what skinner discovered is that , if you put a pigeon in a box like this , and he has to press one of these two keys , and he tries to figure out what the pattern is , and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there — if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern , they will figure out any kind of pattern .
and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward , they repeat that particular pattern .
sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise , once clockwise and peck the key twice .
and that 's called superstition , and that , i 'm afraid , we will always have with us .
`` i call this process `` '' patternicity '' '' — that is , the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise . ''
a type i error , or false positive , is believing a pattern is real when it 's not .
a type ii error is not believing a pattern is real when it is .
your name is lucy , okay ?
and you hear a rustle in the grass .
is it a dangerous predator , or is it just the wind ?
your next decision could be the most important one of your life .
well , if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it 's just the wind , you 've made an error in cognition , made a type i error , false positive .
you 've just won a darwin award .
now the problem here is that patternicities will occur whenever the cost of making a type i error is less than the cost of making a type ii error .
this is the only equation in the talk by the way .
we have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a type i and a type ii error is highly problematic , especially in split-second , life-and-death situations .
so the default position is just : believe all patterns are real — all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not just the wind .
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines , our pattern-seeking brain processes , to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that i 'll come back to .
so for example , what do you see here ?
it 's a horse head , that 's right .
that 's a pattern .
see , our pattern detection device , which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex — it 's our little detection device there — can be easily fooled , and this is the problem .
for example , what do you see here ?
once i prime the brain — it 's called cognitive priming — once i prime the brain to see it , it pops back out again even without the pattern that i 've imposed on it .
yes , there it is . and there 's the prime .
this is an experiment done by jennifer whitson at u.t . austin on corporate environments and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control makes people see illusory patterns .
people that are put in a condition of feeling out of control are more likely to see something in this , which is allegedly patternless .
in other words , the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there 's a lack of control .
for example , baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they 're batting , but not so much when they 're fielding .
because fielders are successful 90 to 95 percent of the time .
the best batters fail seven out of 10 times .
so their superstitions , their patternicities , are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth .
what do you see in this particular one here , in this field ?
anybody see an object there ?
and those who scored high on the esp scale , tended to not only see more patterns in the degraded images but incorrect patterns .
here is what you show subjects .
a similar experiment was done by another [ swiss ] psychologist named peter brugger , who found significantly more meaningful patterns were perceived on the right hemisphere , via the left visual field , than the left hemisphere .
so if you present subjects the images such that it 's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left , then they 're more likely to see patterns than if you put it on the left hemisphere .
our right hemisphere appears to be where a lot of this patternicity occurs .
brugger and his colleague , christine mohr , gave subjects l-dopa .
in fact , neuroleptic drugs that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior , things like paranoia , delusions and hallucinations , these are patternicities .
they 're incorrect patterns . they 're false positives . they 're type i errors .
and if you give them drugs that are dopamine antagonists , they go away .
so you 're more likely to feel in a euphoric state , creativity , find more patterns .
so perhaps more dopamine is related to more creativity .
dopamine , i think , changes our signal-to-noise ratio .
that is , how accurate we are in finding patterns .
you miss the real patterns . you do n't want to be too skeptical .
every time somebody looks at you , you think people are staring at you .
you think people are talking about you .
and if you go too far on that , that 's just simply labeled as madness .
one sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a nobel prize .
and we then call that schizophrenia .
and of course you all know exactly what this is , right ?
these are sandals .
pretty sexy feet , i must say .
it turns out what you 're thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see .
of course , thanks to the environmentalist movement we 're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals .
so what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is , of course , the dolphins , right ?
( laughter ) if we can give you conflicting data , again , your acc is going to be going into hyperdrive .
if you look down here , it 's fine . if you look up here , then you get conflicting data .
and then we have to flip the image for you to see that it 's a set up .
but even when i take it away , the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired to find those certain kinds of patterns .
this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle .
and so your brain is fooled .
yet again , your pattern detection devices are fooled .
here 's some faces on the side of a rock .
in a quick reaction , which one looks odd ?
now , they trade up the politicians every time .
well , why is this happening ?
well , we know exactly where it happens , in the temporal lobe , right across , sort of above your ear there , in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus .
and there 's two types of cells that do this , that record facial features either globally , or specifically these large , rapid-firing cells , first look at the general face .
and then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth .
now i said back in our little thought experiment , you 're a hominid walking on the plains of africa .
is it just the wind or a dangerous predator ?
what 's the difference between those ?
so it 's a type of that expanded to explain , i think , a lot of different things : souls , spirits , ghosts , gods , demons , angels , aliens , intelligent designers , government conspiracists and all manner of invisible agents with power and intention , are believed to haunt our world and control our lives .
it 's the belief that aliens are somehow more advanced than us , more moral than us , and the narratives always are that they 're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high .
and this is also , i think , the basis of conspiracy theories .
there 's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings , whether it 's the illuminati or the bilderbergers .
some patterns are real and some are not .
was jfk assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin ?
my favorite one was he was in the manhole .
and he popped out at the last second , took that shot .
but of course , lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy .
because , let 's face it , some patterns are real .
some conspiracies really are true .
and 9/11 has a conspiracy theory . it is a conspiracy .
you know how we know that 9/11 was not orchestrated by the bush administration ?
because it worked .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so we are natural-born dualists .
our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these .
because we can imagine , in essence , continuing on .
we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe , you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences , near-death experiences , which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there .
you get a hypoxia , or a lower oxygen .
and the brain then senses that there 's an out-of-body experience .
you can use — which i did , went out and did — michael persinger 's god helmet , that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves .
it 's just a minute and a half .
narrator : this is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm .
would you have any problem kissing our models to test it ?
girl : no .
girl : that would be fine . ( woman : okay . ) so this is a blind test .
kay , now can you see anything ? ( girl : no . ) pull it so you ca n't even see down . ( girl : okay . ) woman : it 's completely blind now , right ?
girl : yes . ( woman : okay . ) now , what i 'm going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips , the texture , right , and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not .
girl : okay . ( woman : have you ever done a kissing test before ? ) girl : no .
( music ) ( laughter ) ( laughter ) woman : okay .
and , jennifer , how did that feel ?
jennifer : good .
i 'm here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them .
this red dot marks the great basin of north america , and i 'm involved with an alpine biodiversity project there with some collaborators .
this is a rugged and barren landscape , yet there are quite a few spiders here .
turning rocks over revealed this crab spider grappling with a beetle .
there are over 40,000 described species of spiders .
to put that number into perspective , here 's a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates .
there are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates .
even fossil spiders can make silk , as we can see from this impression of a spinneret on this fossil spider .
it does n't take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life .
spiders use silk for many purposes , including the trailing safety dragline , wrapping eggs for reproduction , protective retreats and catching prey .
when you look at this orb web , you 're actually seeing many types of silk fibers .
how does an individual spider make so many kinds of silk ?
`` so silk comes out of the spinnerets , and for those of us spider silk biologists , this is what we call the `` '' business end '' '' of the spider . ( laughter ) we spend long days ... ''
hey ! do n't laugh . that 's my life .
( laughter ) we spend long days and nights staring at this part of the spider .
you can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets , because each spinneret has many spigots on it .
each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot , and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider , what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland . a silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside .
they differ by size , shape , and sometimes even color .
in an orb-web-weaving spider , you can find seven types of silk glands , and what i have depicted here in this picture , let 's start at the one o'clock position , there 's tubuliform silk glands , which are used to make the outer silk of an egg sac .
pyriform silk glands make the attachment cement — that 's the silk that 's used to adhere silk lines to a substrate .
there 's also aciniform silk , which is used to wrap prey .
this is the silk that 's used to make the frame and radii of an orb web , and also the safety trailing dragline .
nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family , so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family , so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk , and over the last 380 million years , that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged , specialized , over and over and over again , to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today .
there are several features that all these silks have in common . they all have a common design , such as they 're all very long — they 're sort of outlandishly long compared to other proteins .
to give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like , this is a dragline silk protein , it 's just a portion of it , from the black widow spider .
you can also see that there 's a lot of short sequence motifs that repeat over and over and over again , so for example there 's a lot of what we call polyalanines , or iterated a 's , aaaaa . there 's ggq . there 's ggy .
so for example this would be one sentence , and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine , that repeats over and over and over again , and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule .
so i 've colored in the glycines again in green , alanine in red , and the serines , the letter s , in purple . and you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple .
what silk biologists do is we try to relate these sequences , these amino acid sequences , to the mechanical properties of the silk fibers .
now , it 's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body .
this makes testing spider silk really , really easy to do in the laboratory , because we 're actually , you know , testing it in air that 's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins .
so this makes quantifying silk properties by methods such as tensile testing , which is basically , you know , tugging on one end of the fiber , very amenable .
here are stress-strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider .
specifically , if you look on the vertical axis , that 's stress . if you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers , you can see that there 's a lot of variation , and in fact dragline , or major ampullate silk , is the strongest of these fibers .
we think that 's because the dragline silk , which is used to make the frame and radii for a web , needs to be very strong .
on the other hand , if you were to look at strain — this is how much a fiber can be extended — if you look at the maximum value here , again , there 's a lot of variation and the clear winner is flagelliform , or the capture spiral filament .
in the case of the capture spiral , it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey .
so if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk , an insect is very likely to just bounce right off . but by having really , really stretchy capture spiral silk , the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey .
but how about variation among spider species , so looking at one type of silk and looking at different species of spiders ?
this is an area that 's largely unexplored but here 's a little bit of data i can show you .
this is the comparison of the toughness of the dragline spilk spun by 21 species of spiders .
some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders .
the 21 species are indicated here by this phylogeny , this evolutionary tree , that shows their genetic relationships , and i 've colored in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders .
if you look right here at the two red arrows , they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus .
in fact , the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region , a non orb-web-weaving spider .
this is the dragline spun by scytodes , the spitting spider .
that 's how scytodes forages .
we do n't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline , but it 's unexpected results like this that make bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile .
now i 'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber , bombyx — or domesticated silkworm silk — wool , kevlar , and carbon fibers .
and the strength , extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response , have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications , for example , as a component of artificial tendons , for serving as guides to regrow nerves , and for scaffolds for tissue growth .
i love when i 'm in the laboratory , a new spider silk sequence comes in .
that 's just the best . ( laughter ) it 's like the spiders are sharing an ancient secret with me , and that 's why i 'm going to spend the rest of my life studying spider silk .
the next time you see a spider web , please , pause and look a little closer .
you 'll be seeing one of the most high-performance materials known to man .
and only then , as time went on , they began to recognize that they were the creators , the owners of these inner voices .
so jaynes 's theory is that consciousness , at least in the way we perceive it today , where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence — is a quite recent cultural development .
the word introspection does not appear a single time in the books we want to analyze .
so our way to solve this is to build the space of words .
this is a huge space that contains all words in such a way that the distance between any two of them is indicative of how closely related they are .
and this has to be true for any two words within the space .
and the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions , of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection .
and i remember vividly , while i was working on this , i was sitting at my computer and i saw a bunch of tweets by polo — polo had been my first student back in buenos aires , and at the time he was living in new york .
so i picked up the phone , and i called polo , and in fact he was not feeling well .
gracias .
what an intriguing group of individuals you are ...
so let me explain why this is so .
`` so , `` '' o '' '' stands for `` '' open to experience , '' '' versus those who are more closed . ''
extroverts , for example , i find intriguing .
already , some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow .
and that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting : loud noises , parties and social events here at ted — you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core .
they all gather together .
it may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation .
sometimes it 's an internal stimulant , from your body .
but it 's a misconstrual .
yes , more .
7.5 .
they not only handle all the male extroverts , they pick up a few introverts as well .
they 'd like to stand close for comfortable communication .
extroverts prefer black-and-white , concrete , simple language .
introverts prefer — and i must again tell you that i am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine — we speak differently .
as it were . ( laughter )
when we talk , we sometimes talk past each other .
first , his name is tom .
i have a tendency not to be .
i am seriously introverted .
and michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt .
`` so the person who seconded him asked tom and me , `` what do you make of michael ? '' ''
now is this something that we should be heedful of ?
are we just a bunch of traits ?
but are there some distinctively elizabethan features of your behavior , or georgian of yours , that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits ?
not just because you 're a certain type of person .
it 's the doings that we have in our life — the personal projects .
it relates to your kid — you 've been back three times to the hospital , and they still do n't know what 's wrong .
or it could be your mom .
and they are what matters .
and i adore my students , and i adore my field .
but we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character .
if anything is guaranteed to constipate an introvert for six months , it 's talking on the john . ( laughter )
do n't follow me .
thank you .
and while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it , all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online .
in fact , in over a decade on the web , the only thing that has changed about video is the size of the box and the quality of the picture .
videos created with popcorn behave like the web itself : dynamic , full of links , and completely remixable , and finally allowed to break free from the frame .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any browser .
so let 's watch it . we 'll go back , and i 'll show you how we made it .
i 've added my location with a google map , and it 's live , so try moving it around .
you can add pop-ups with live links and custom icons , or pull in content from any web service , like flickr , or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content .
there are two pop-ups bringing you some other information , and a final article with a link out to the original article .
popcorn immediately goes out onto the web , talks to google , grabs the map , and puts it in the display .
now in the video , i mentioned adding a live feed , which we can do right now , so let 's add a live feed from flickr . go over to the right-hand side , grab flickr from the list of options , drag it into the timeline , and put it where you 'd like it to go , and it immediately goes out to flickr and starts pulling in images based on the tags . now , my developers really like ponies , and so they 've set that as the default tag .
now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed .
thank you . ( applause )
and something very , very nice happens .
here are two reasons companies fail : they only do more of the same , or they only do what 's new .
both are necessary , but it can be too much of a good thing .
facit was a fantastic company .
they were born deep in the swedish forest , and they made the best mechanical calculators in the world .
and what did facit do when the electronic calculator came along ?
they continued doing exactly the same .
in six months , they went from maximum revenue ...
to me , the irony about the facit story is hearing about the facit engineers , who had bought cheap , small electronic calculators in japan that they used to double-check their calculators .
but exploration can go wild , too .
a few years back , i worked closely alongside a european biotech company .
let 's call them oncosearch .
the company was brilliant .
i first heard about exploration and exploitation about 15 years ago , when i worked as a visiting scholar at stanford university .
exploration .
it 's about search , it 's about discovery , it 's about new products , it 's about new innovations .
our heroes are people who have done exploration : madame curie , picasso , neil armstrong , sir edmund hillary , etc .
we all know that exploration is risky .
exploitation is the opposite .
exploitation is not risky — in the short term .
and i think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same songs again and again , until they become obsolete or even pathetic .
that 's the risk of exploitation .
so if we take a long-term perspective , we explore .
if we take a short-term perspective , we exploit .
small children , they explore all day .
all day it 's about exploration .
as we grow older , we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on .
and i hear very often questions phrased in different ways .
`` or , `` '' how can i make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis ? '' '' so , doing one well is difficult . ''
doing both well as the same time is art — pushing both exploration and exploitation .
so one thing we 've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time , in parallel .
but when they do , the payoffs are huge .
we have nestlé creating nespresso , we have lego going into animated films , toyota creating the hybrids , unilever pushing into sustainability — there are lots of examples , and the benefits are huge .
why is balancing so difficult ?
so i 'll talk about two , but there are many .
but the same goes for that , then we 're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated .
oncosearch was a good example .
a famous example is , of course , xerox .
facit fell into the success trap .
they literally held the future in their hands , but they could n't see it .
they were simply so good at making what they loved doing , that they would n't change .
`` bill gates has said : `` '' success is a lousy teacher . ''
`` it seduces us into thinking we can not fail . '' '' that 's the challenge with success . ''
the first lesson is : get ahead of the crisis .
and any company that 's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future .
any company we look at , taking a one-year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company , innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent .
move ahead , take a 10-year perspective on the same company — suddenly , innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent .
but companies ca n't choose .
i do n't think it 's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves .
i think it 's a team sport .
last one : be skeptical of success .
`` riding into rome on the carriage , they always had a companion whispering in their ear , `` remember , you 're only human . '' ''
so i hope i made the point : balancing exploration and exploitation has a huge payoff .
but it 's difficult , and we need to be conscious .
and what can you do to challenge ?
second question is : when did i explore something new last , and what kind of effect did it have on me ?
in my case , yes .
so let me leave you with this .
( applause )
i want to tell you about the future of money .
now , i want to tell you about the yap because their form of money is really interesting .
they use these limestone discs called rai stones .
you might think that this was just a small culture a hundred years ago .
but things like this happen in the western world as well , and the yap actually still use a form of these stones .
in 1932 , the bank of france asked the united states to convert their holdings from dollars into gold .
but it was too inconvenient to think about actually shipping all of that gold over to europe .
the only reason these things have any value is because we 've all decided they should .
and because we 've decided that , they do .
it 's about a collective story that we tell each other about value .
a collective fiction .
and that 's a really powerful concept .
all of these interactions are literally just changing 1 's and 0 's on computers .
there 's not even anything physical , like a stone or a coin .
now when this works , it 's because there are large institutions underwriting every 1 or 0 that changes on a computer .
and a lot of times , they do n't .
there 's a lot of friction in the system .
half my credit cards still do n't work in europe .
that 's friction .
transferring money across borders and across currencies is really expensive : friction .
my account gets frozen , and i ca n't get paid .
they 're on all these different websites and services .
and most of these services do n't work together .
they do n't inter-operate .
the same thing happens when institutions control the money supply .
so far , we 've been through two phases of money .
money only moves at the speed of banks .
we 're about to enter a new phase of money .
the future of money is programmable .
when we combine software and currency , money becomes more than just a static unit of value , and we do n't have to rely on institutions for security .
in a programmable world , we remove humans and institutions from the loop .
and when this happens , we wo n't even feel like we 're transacting anymore .
money will be directed by software , and it will just safely and securely flow .
it 's money designed to work in a world without intermediaries .
i have an app on my phone that i can use to buy sashimi .
but it 's not just for small transactions .
during world war ii , breaking cryptosystems like enigma was critical to decoding enemy transmissions and turning the tide of the war .
it 's what makes it safe for us to type our passwords in and to send financial information to websites .
and this means that we do n't have to rely on the banks anymore to secure our transactions .
bitcoin is based on the very same idea that the yap used , this collective global knowledge of transfers .
in bitcoin , i spend by transferring bitcoin , and i get paid when someone transfers bitcoin to me .
imagine that we had this magic paper .
let 's say we just give everyone this paper and everyone writes down the transfers that they 're doing in the bitcoin system .
and i can look at mine and i 'll have a list of all of the transfers that are happening in the entire bitcoin economy .
this is actually what 's happening with the bitcoin blockchain , which is a list of all of the transactions in bitcoin .
all of these computers are collectively confirming who owns what bitcoin .
but where do bitcoins actually come from ?
well , the code is designed to create new bitcoin according to a schedule .
and the way that it works is that to get those bitcoin , i have to solve a puzzle — a random cryptographic puzzle .
whenever the dice come up all sixes , we say that we win .
this is very close to what these computers are all actually doing .
they 're trying over and over again to land on the right number .
and in the act of solving this puzzle , these computers are actually helping to secure the bitcoin blockchain and add to the list of transactions .
there are actually people all over the world running this software , and we call them bitcoin miners .
the miners , professional miners , use this special hardware that 's designed to solve the puzzle really fast .
but the next generation is going to be so much better and so much faster .
cryptocurrencies are the first step to a world with a global programmable money .
this is a really amazing thing .
the internet caused an explosion of innovation , because it was built upon an open architecture .
and just like the internet changed the way we communicate , programmable money is going to change the way we pay , allocate and decide on value .
they can run large-scale data analysis and provide me with a cryptographic proof that shows they 're only using my data in a way that we agreed .
digital money , like the horse and carriage , works pretty well , and the whole world economy is built on it .
we 're entering a new era of programmable money .
cryptocurrencies can be used for illegal transactions , just like cash is used for crime in the world today .
when all of our transactions are online , what does that mean for surveillance — who can see what we do ?
who 's advantaged in this new world and who is n't ?
will i have to start to pay for things that i did n't have to pay for before ?
will we all become slaves to algorithms and utility functions ?
but it also greatly increased productivity .
but it 's also going to create new , flexible forms of employment .
with programmable money , we decouple the need for large , trusted institutions from the architecture of the network .
hi , kids .
we all feel younger than our real age , because the spirit never ages .
i am still 17 .
sophia loren . look at her .
i tried it and gained 10 pounds in the wrong places .
at 88 , she has saved 12,000 girls , and she has changed the culture in the country .
ram dass says that dependency hurts , but if you accept it , there is less suffering .
what have i gained ?
freedom : i do n't have to prove anything anymore .
i do n't have to please men anymore , only animals .
i feel lighter .
and i also feel softer because i 'm not scared of being vulnerable .
i do n't see it as weakness anymore .
and i 've gained spirituality .
i 'm aware that before , death was in the neighborhood .
i try to live mindfully and be present in the moment .
by the way , the dalai lama is someone who has aged beautifully , but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate ?
( laughter ) meditation helps .
( video ) child : ommm . ommm . ommm .
isabel allende : ommm . ommm . there it is .
and it 's good to start early .
i want to be the center of attention .
she has been in a wheelchair for six years after a terrible car accident .
she wears red patent shoes , and her mantra is that one scarf is nice but two is better .
she has been a widow for nine years , but she 's not looking for another mate .
so how can i stay passionate ?
i have been training for some time , and when i feel flat and bored , i fake it .
attitude , attitude .
yes to life .
it does n't always work , but you can not blame me for trying .
jubilation . celebration .
we have paid our dues .
now it 's our time , and it 's a great time .
i have chosen to stay passionate , engaged with an open heart .
want to join me ?
thank you .
( applause ) june cohen : so isabel — ia : thank you .
indian academic year begins in june .
and what if we go back beyond that single ancestor , when there was presumably a competition among many languages ?
those are my kids , natalie and david .
( applause )
now , not all janitors are like this , of course .
dad , being an academic , had no idea that mike 's hard lemonade contained alcohol .
fair enough .
fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ...
get smarter incentives .
his employees are inspired by the effort .
as practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary , if not extraordinary heroes .
they need to learn to respect themselves .
like many urban schools with high poverty rates , we face numerous challenges , like finding teachers who can empathize with the complexities of a disadvantaged community , lack of funding for technology , low parental involvement and neighborhood gangs that recruit children as early as fourth grade .
eighty-six percent of them were below grade level in english and in math .
if our children are not in our classrooms , how will they learn ?
or to have a young woman say to me that she had a lifelong goal of working in a fast-food restaurant .
`` we call our students `` '' scholars , '' '' because they 're lifelong learners . ''
this is nearly 200 children , who are now going to some of the most competitive high schools in new york city .
yet he can still be influenced by a principal who had opened up a school that believes in all children .
and the impossibilities that had been imposed upon them by a disadvantaged community were replaced by hope and purpose .
these are the things that inspire children .
but it is not an easy task .
and they are our responsibility .
that means everyone in here , and those who are watching the screen .
( applause )
right now there is an aspiring teacher who is working on a 60-page paper based on some age-old education theory developed by some dead education professor wondering to herself what this task that she 's engaging in has to do with what she wants to do with her life , which is be an educator , change lives , and spark magic . right now there is an aspiring teacher
right now there 's a student who is coming up with a way to convince his mom or dad that he 's very , very sick and ca n't make it to school tomorrow .
right now .
and that to me is sad .
it 's sad because the people who i described , they were very disinterested in the learning process , want to be effective teachers , but they have no models .
i 'm going to paraphrase mark twain .
barber shops , rap concerts , and most importantly , in the black church .
who here has been to a black church ?
we got a couple of hands .
that preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention .
so i make the argument that we reframe teacher education , that we could focus on content , and that 's fine , and we could focus on theories , and that 's fine , but content and theories with the absence of the magic of teaching and learning means nothing .
`` and when they try to describe what that is , they just say , `` '' he has that magic . '' '' but i 'm here to tell you that magic can be taught . ''
now , how do you teach it ? you teach it by allowing people
to go into those spaces where the magic is happening .
you 've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop , you 've got to attend that black church , and you 've got to view those folks that have the power to engage and just take notes on what they do .
they watch the way that the rappers move and talk with their hands .
they study the way that he walks proudly across that stage .
they learn that if you just stare at a student and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch , you do n't have to say a word because they know that that means that you want more .
we intuit other people 's feelings ; we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen .
we are social to the core .
and for them , autism was devastating .
these are survival skills .
well , they orient to the caregiver .
the caregiver seeks the baby .
it does n't ; it begins with the beginning of life .
and that thing is called attention .
they also learn to follow other people 's gazes , because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about .
imagine if i did that to you , came two inches from your face .
now , remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences .
so we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic , the brain determines who we 're going to be .
and you know what ?
autism creates itself .
in this scan pass , in green here , are two-year-olds with autism .
and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
the stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter .
it was an amazing sort of insight for me .
anyway , another interesting thing happened while i was there .
that 's a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week , four words that will come to define this century .
here they are : the earth is full .
yes , we are a brilliant and creative species , but we 've created a little too much stuff — so much that our economy is now bigger than its host , our planet .
there are many science-based analyses of this , but they all draw the same conclusion — that we 're living beyond our means .
in financial terms , this would be like always spending 50 percent more than you earn , going further into debt every year .
so when i say full , i mean really full — well past any margin for error , well past any dispute about methodology .
what this means is our economy is unsustainable .
in other words , thanks to those pesky laws of physics , when things are n't sustainable , they stop .
but that 's not possible , you might think .
we ca n't stop economic growth .
it will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources , all the capacity , all the systems of the earth , which is now having economic damage .
`` when we think about economic growth stopping , we go , `` '' that 's not possible , '' '' because economic growth is so essential to our society that is is rarely questioned . ''
that 's not possible .
there are so many ways we can improve the way we do things .
we can surely sort this out .
well , it 's mostly true .
we are certainly amazing , and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity .
we plan to take this highly-stressed economy and make it twice as big and then make it four times as big — not in some distant future , but in less than 40 years , in the life time of most of you .
china plans to be there in just 20 years .
the only problem with this plan is that it 's not possible .
we need it to develop technology .
we need it to keep social stability .
it 's like the earth does n't care what we need .
this is about food and water , soil and climate , the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives .
so the idea that we can smoothly transition to a highly-efficient , solar-powered , knowledge-based economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in 2050 a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion .
it 's not that it 's not possible to feed , clothe and house us all and have us live decent lives .
it certainly is .
but the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong , and it 's dangerously wrong , because it means we 're not getting ready for what 's really going to happen .
if it 's that bad , we 'll react .
let 's just think through that idea .
now we 've had 50 years of warnings .
we 've had science proving the urgency of change .
we 've had economic analysis pointing out that , not only can we afford it , it 's cheaper to act early .
and yet , the reality is we 've done pretty much nothing to change course .
and that 's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for .
i know most people do n't see it that way .
but we see , mistakenly , each of these issues as individual problems to be solved .
i want to do so because , in my view , the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question .
of course , we ca n't know what will happen .
imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bursts , when the financial markets recognize that , to have any hope of preventing the climate spiraling out of control , the oil and coal industries are finished .
imagine the middle east without oil income , but with collapsing governments .
imagine our highly-tuned , just-in-time food industry and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves emptying .
imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen .
`` imagine what you 'll tell your children when they ask you , `` '' so , in 2012 , mom and dad , what was it like when you 'd had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row , when every scientific body in the world was saying you 've got a major problem , when the oceans were acidifying , when oil and food prices were spiking , when they were rioting in the streets of london and occupying wall street ? ''
just take a moment and take a breath and think , what do you feel at this point ?
maybe fear .
of course , we ca n't know what 's going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty .
but when we think about the kind of possibilities i paint , we should feel a bit of fear .
but this time it 's not a tiger at the cave mouth .
but if you look , you can see it at the door of your civilization .
you see , those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem , that technology is limitless , that markets can be a force for good , are in fact right .
the only thing they 're missing is that it takes a good crisis to get us going .
think about war .
think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done .
think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy .
( laughter ) sure , if we get it wrong , we could face the end of this civilization , but if we get it right , it could be the beginning of civilization instead .
to my surprise , eliminating net co2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap , not very cheap , but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization .
we did n't calculate that precisely , but we understand that 's very expensive .
you can read the details , but in summary , we can transform our economy .
we can do it at an affordable cost .
the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel .
and this is where you come in .
when we think about the future i paint , of course we should feel a bit of fear .
we need to act like we only have one planet .
i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth , more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .
we can be more , we can be much more .
we 've built a powerful foundation of science , knowledge and technology — more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent , meaningful and satisfying lives .
the earth can support that if we choose the right path .
like generations before us , we 'll be growing up in war — not a war between civilizations , but a war for civilization , for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around into middle age .
this could be our finest hour .
thank you .
( applause )
colorful characters , and a good time is had by all .
there 's a wonderful , small example going on right now .
you can hear this distribution under that complaint .
it has de-professionalized publishing .
and i 've noticed an interesting shift .
and this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network .
and this is only mapping 10 percent of a mammalian neocortex .
but knowledge is much more intricate than this .
this is the typical organization chart .
we can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism .
and here is an example .
but networks are not just a scientific metaphor .
but networkism does n't happen only in two dimensions .
and on your right side , you have the millennium simulation .
you see this object here .
it 's a set of concentric geodesic structures with linkages between each one .
it has a symmetry such that you ca n't injection mold it .
wish us luck .
it 's actually 2d printing over and over again , and it in fact uses the technologies associated with 2d printing .
light and oxygen work in different ways .
it 's not only transparent to light but it 's permeable to oxygen .
the result is pretty staggering .
so great material properties .
you know , the world is really good at nano-fabrication .
and subtractive techniques from the silicon industry ca n't do that very well .
thanks for listening .
we 'll just take one example here : a virus is a natural system , right ?
so that 's just forming some body stuff , right ?
the protocell moves . it encounters the food .
well , good afternoon .
well , i have to tell you , from the bottom of our hearts , thank you so very , very much .
do you know to date the als association has raised 125 million dollars ?
woo hoo ! ( applause ) it takes me back to the summer of 2011 .
`` i do n't feel this is my mission in life . '' '' and he said , `` '' you know , oh by the way , mom , i have to leave early from vacation because my inter-city league team that i play for made the playoffs , and i have to get back to boston because i ca n't let my team down . ''
we 're at the playoff game , pete 's at the plate , and a fastball 's coming in , and it hits him on the wrist .
oh , pete .
his wrist went completely limp , like this .
we walked into the neurologist 's office , sat down , four doctors walk in , and the head neurologist sits down .
i had had a friend whose 80-year-old father had als .
`` i looked at my husband , he looked at me , and then we looked at the doctor , and we said , `` '' als ? ''
we did n't even understand that it had been 75 years since lou gehrig and nothing had been done in the progress against als .
but then our leader , pete , set the vision , and talked to us just like we were his new team .
six months after diagnosis , pete was given an award at a research summit for advocacy .
and not only that , where 's the flip chart with the action items and the follow-up and the accountability ?
we were supposed to have therapies overseas , and the rug was pulled out from under us .
he ca n't speak .
and it was very significant , because he wrote it using his eye gaze technology .
twenty days later , the ice started to fall .
over the next couple of days , our news feed was full of family and friends .
you 've got to see uncle artie 's human bloody mary .
( laughter ) and those videos , the popular ones .
paul bissonnette 's glacier video , incredible .
how about the redemption nuns of dublin ?
that 's when we knew , that was a real a-list celebrity .
`` i go back on my texts , and i can see `` '' jt ! jt ! '' '' my sister texting me . ''
angela merkel , the chancellor of germany .
all of them .
als tdi in cambridge , they raised three million dollars .
well , guess what ?
bill gates .
goal number one , check .
the first thing is , every morning when you wake up , you can choose to live your day in positivity .
pete still goes to baseball games and he still sits with his teammates in the dugout , and he hangs his gravity feed bag right on the cages .
`` `` pete , is that okay ? '' `` yup . '' ''
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
the second thing that my son has given me is he 's given me my mission in life .
now i know why i 'm here .
and so — ( applause ) — and so let me leave you with pete 's words of inspiration that he would use to classmates , coworkers and teammates .
be genuine .
be hardworking .
why bother ?
the choices are terrible .
but in spite of all this , i still believe voting matters .
and crazy as it may sound , i believe we can revive the joy of voting .
today , i want to talk about how we can do that , and why .
it was street theater , open-air debates , fasting and feasting and toasting , parades and bonfires .
that culture grew with each successive wave of new voters .
from freedom summer to the march in selma , that generation of activists knew that voting matters , and they knew that spectacle and the performance of power is key to actually claiming power .
screens have made citizens into spectators .
and while it 's nice to share political memes on social media , that 's a rather quiet kind of citizenship .
in brazil , election day is a festive , carnival-type atmosphere .
in taiwan and hong kong , there is a spectacle , eye-popping , eye-grabbing spectacle to the street theater of elections .
you might ask , well , here in america , who has time for this ?
and i 'll tell you , any citizen who wants to be seen and heard not as a prop , not as a talking point , but as a participant , as a creator .
well , how do we make this happen ?
there are 20 of these projects , and they are remarkable in their beauty and their diversity , and they are changing people .
let me tell you about a couple of them .
but the thing is , atomico had never voted .
and to do so , they put out an open call to the public asking for speeches , monologues , dialogues , poems , snippets of anything that could be read aloud and woven into a performance .
they got dozens of submissions .
`` it 's called `` '' the joy of voting . '' '' `` `` i would like to vote for the first time because things are changing for hispanics . ''
i used to be afraid of ghosts .
there 's more violence and racism .
voting can change this .
the border wall is nothing .
the wall of shame is something .
it 's very important to vote so we can break down this wall of shame .
i have passion in my heart .
voting gives me a voice and power .
`` i can stand up and do something . '' '' `` `` the joy of voting '' '' project is n't just about joy . ''
which brings me back to where i began .
why bother ?
there 's one way to answer this question .
voting matters because it is a self-fulfilling act of belief .
when we vote , even if it is in anger , we are part of a collective , creative leap of faith .
voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had .
both of them create great public experiences of shared ritual .
this moment right now , when we think about the meaning of imagination , is so fundamentally important , and our ability to take that spirit and to take that sense that there is something greater out there , is not just a matter of technical expertise .
it is a matter of spirit .
why bother voting ?
they did that by voting .
well , here 's the thing : everyday democracy already gives us a playbook for revolution .
in the 2014 midterm elections , turnout was 36 percent , which was a 70-year low .
i invite you to imagine 100 percent .
mobilize 100 percent , and overnight , we get revolution .
we have to make joy .
( applause )
`` text : `` '' between two fires : torture and displacement in northern uganda '' '' man : when we were at home , it was kony 's [ rebel ] soldiers disturbing us . ''
peter gabriel : so torture is not something that always happens on other soil .
the impact was great .
i did n't utter a word .
but my colleagues did n't know .
and here was him , denying .
i mean , everybody has their hazard .
it 's that quick .
her guts were swimming with parasitic worms .
my mother left school when she was 15 .
these paintings are thought to be round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old .
art : what humanity has done ever since it evolved .
so look at this little picture .
`` i want to tell you about two examples of stories that are thought to be of universal importance : `` e.t . '' and `` hamlet . '' ''
not only that , but some really bad scientists want to do some experiments on him , and they 're looking for him .
so the children have a plot .
caroline thought he was marginalizing half of humanity .
men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication , but of course , how could they be ?
that is the question .
and then when he 's finished with ophelia , he turns on his mum , because basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle and enjoy sex .
but i was told this was the story of human beings , despite the fact that it only had two women in it .
`` `` '' there 's joan knight , who 's a lesbian , there 's joan littlewood , who 's retired , and there 's buzz goodbody , who 's just killed herself . ''
and i want to ask you : do you believe that ?
and remember this : that in a sense , if we 're going to get past this moment of a world where we know that we are unequal , it 's artists who have to imagine a different world .
let 's paint it . let 's draw it .
let 's write about it . let 's film it .
they were large . they were hairy .
they bury their dead . they educate the next of kin .
it looks like they were interbreeding .
and the thing is , is that this is n't google .
and it 's not social media .
it 's not robotics .
now , it 's not the most sonorous word in the world , but i believe that this is now the next generation of the internet , and that it holds vast promise for every business , every society and for all of you , individually .
but when it comes to assets — things like money , financial assets like stocks and bonds , loyalty points , intellectual property , music , art , a vote , carbon credit and other assets — sending you a copy is a really bad idea .
it can take a second for an email to go around the world , but it can take days or weeks for money to move through the banking system across a city .
and they take a big piece of the action — 10 to 20 percent just to send money to another country .
what if there were a native medium for value ?
now , do n't be confused about bitcoin — bitcoin is an asset ; it goes up and down , and that should be of interest to you if you 're a speculator .
so for the first time now in human history , people everywhere can trust each other and transact peer to peer .
`` and because trust is native to the technology , i call this , `` '' the trust protocol . '' '' now , you 're probably wondering : how does this thing work ? ''
fair enough .
they have massive computing power at their fingertips — 10 to 100 times bigger than all of google worldwide .
then the miners get to work , trying to solve some tough problems .
and they compete : the first miner to find out the truth and to validate the block , is rewarded in digital currency , in the case of the bitcoin blockchain , with bitcoin .
and then — this is the key part — that block is linked to the previous block and the previous block to create a chain of blocks .
so if i wanted to go and hack a block and , say , pay you and you with the same money , i 'd have to hack that block , plus all the preceding blocks , the entire history of commerce on that blockchain , not just on one computer but across millions of computers , simultaneously , all using the highest levels of encryption , in the light of the most powerful computing resource in the world that 's watching me .
tough to do .
blockchain . that 's how it works .
one of them is that you can build smart contracts .
it 's kind of what it sounds like .
rube goldberg machine .
i mean , you tap your card in the corner store , and a bitstream goes through a dozen companies , each with their own computer system , some of them being 1970s mainframes older than many of the people in this room , and three days later , a settlement occurs .
well , let me describe some applications .
and this is at the heart of all of the anger and extremism and protectionism and xenophobia and worse that we 're seeing growing in the world today , brexit being the most recent case .
let me describe five ways that this can be done .
number one : did you know that 70 percent of the people in the world who have land have a tenuous title to it ?
so today , companies are working with governments to put land titles on a blockchain .
my view is that ...
these companies are not really sharing .
what if , rather than airbnb being a $ 25 billion corporation , there was a distributed application on a blockchain , we 'll call it b-airbnb , and it was essentially owned by all of the people who have a room to rent .
analie domingo is a housekeeper .
she lives in toronto , and every month she goes to the western union office with some cash to send her remittances to her mom in manila .
and from her mobile device , she sent 300 bucks .
it went directly to her mom 's mobile device without going through an intermediary .
and data is really a new asset class , maybe bigger than previous asset classes , like land under the agrarian economy , or an industrial plant , or even money .
and the virtual you is not owned by you — that 's the big problem .
and this black box moves around with you as you travel throughout the world , and it 's very , very stingy .
and then this avatar is sweeping up all of this data and enabling you to monetize it .
it was broken by the first era of the internet .
musicians are left with crumbs at the end of the whole food chain .
you know , if you were a songwriter , 25 years ago , you wrote a hit song , it got a million singles , you could get royalties of around 45,000 dollars .
there are all kinds of people who do n't get fair compensation , and with blockchains , they 're going to be able to make it rain on the blockchain .
now , technology does n't create prosperity , of course — people do .
that is how our women dress .
i should tell you our story .
in fact , we are thriving , and the reason we are thriving is because we 've been blessed with extraordinary kings .
back in the 1970s , our fourth king famously pronounced that for bhutan , gross national happiness is more important than gross national product .
so our economy is small , but here is where it gets interesting .
education is completely free .
we manage this because we use our limited resources very carefully , and because we stay faithful to the core mission of gnh , which is development with values .
today , our culture is flourishing .
here 's a fun fact : you 're looking at the world 's biggest pocket .
but he went further .
he was all of 51 years at that time .
turns out , it 's a big deal .
bhutan is not carbon neutral .
so today , the clean energy that we export offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood .
you see , the world is getting warmer , and climate change is a reality .
it 's stunning .
it was a solid glacier .
we first made this promise in 2009 during cop 15 in copenhagen , but nobody noticed .
this time , we were heard .
we were noticed , and everybody cared .
all countries , from the very small to the very large , committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions .
take this tiger , for example .
is n't that awesome ?
we must keep our parks awesome .
over the next few years , our small economy wo n't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment .
this is why his majesty the king started bhutan for life .
bhutan for life gives us the time we need .
we are almost there .
naturally , i 'm pretty excited .
whew , it is getting warm in here .
some of us might dress differently , but we are in it together .
and the things that they build amaze even themselves .
so the problem is : as you add more features , where are they going to go ?
`` i 'm a little nervous , because my wife yvonne said to me , she said , `` '' geoff , you watch the ted talks . '' '' i said , `` '' yes , honey , i love ted talks . '' '' she said , `` '' you know , they 're like , really smart , talented — `` '' i said , `` '' i know , i know . '' '' ( laughter ) she said , `` '' they do n't want , like , the angry black man . '' '' ( laughter ) so i said , `` '' no , i 'm gon na be good , honey , i 'm gon na be good . i am . '' '' but i am angry . ( laughter ) and the last time i looked , i 'm — ( applause ) so this is why i 'm excited but i 'm angry . ''
you know , i grew up in the inner city , and there were kids who were failing in schools 56 years ago when i first went to school , and those schools are still lousy today , 56 years later .
and you know something about a lousy school ?
it 's not like a bottle of wine .
one size fits all , if you get it , fine , and if you do n't , tough luck . just tough luck .
why have n't we allowed innovation to happen ?
they operated 10 to 3. they were closed for lunch hour .
who created that business model ? right ?
and it went on for decades .
how could you go to the bank when you were at work ? it did n't matter .
and they do n't care whether or not geoff is upset he ca n't go to the bank . go find another bank .
maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work .
what about introducing technology ?
now look , i 'm a technology fan , but i have to admit to you all i 'm a little old .
`` i am never using that , right ? '' '' so technology has changed . things have changed . ''
yet not in education . why ?
why is it that when we had rotary phones , when we were having folks being crippled by polio , that we were teaching the same way then that we 're doing right now ?
and if you come up with a plan to change things , people consider you radical .
i said one day , well , look , if the science says — this is science , not me — that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime — you see where they are in june and say , okay , they 're there .
you look at them in september , they 've gone down .
( laughter ) every 10 years they reproduce the same study .
you know , i always wonder , who makes up those rules ?
for years i went to — look , i went the harvard ed school .
you plant them in the spring .
so who came up with this idea ? who owns it ?
why did we ever do it ?
they did n't have any place for their kids to go .
`` science . you have bill gates coming out and saying , `` look , this works , right ? we can do this . '' ''
how many places in america are going to change ? none .
as a profession , we have to stop this . the science is clear .
we know that the problem begins immediately .
right ? this idea , zero to three .
my wife , yvonne , and i , we have four kids , three grown ones and a 15-year-old .
that 's a longer story .
we did n't know how critical those first three years were .
we did n't know what was happening in those young brains .
wealthy people know . educated people know .
and their kids have an advantage .
poor people do n't know , and we 're not doing anything to help them at all .
but we know this is critical .
we know it 's important for kids .
poor kids need that experience .
you know , we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about , you know , because i 'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff , but we do health services , and i have to raise a lot of money .
`` people used to say when they 'd come fund us , `` geoff , why do you provide these health services ? '' ''
but now i 'm older , and you know what i tell them ?
you know why i provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts ?
because i actually like kids .
i mean , you 're educators . you work , you say , you think you 've got it , great , no ? and you find out they did n't get it .
but here 's the problem with testing .
and the results have great data .
they 'll tell you raheem really struggled , could n't do two-digit multiplication — so great data , but you 're getting it back after school is over .
and so , what do you do ?
you go on vacation . ( laughter ) you come back from vacation .
now you 've got all of this test data from last year .
why would you look at it ?
you 're going to go and teach this year .
so how much money did we just spend on all of that ?
billions and billions of dollars for data that it 's too late to use .
i need that data in september .
because in my older years , i 've become somewhat of a clairvoyant .
you take me to any school .
i 'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling .
and you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids were on grade level .
so we 're spending all of this money , but we 're getting what ?
the high stakes is today , because you can do something about it .
some of it 's not going to work .
`` you know , people tell me , `` '' yeah , those charter schools , a lot of them do n't work . '' '' a lot of them do n't . they should be closed . ''
but we ca n't confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we should n't therefore do anything .
`` they told me , `` '' geoff , if you get this palmpilot you 'll never need another thing . '' '' that thing lasted all of three weeks . it was over . ''
the folks went out there . they kept inventing .
and we 've got to do better . the evaluation , we have to start with kids earlier , we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people .
we 've got to give them all of these opportunities .
so that we have to do . but this innovation issue , this idea that we 've got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical .
and this is something , by the way , that i think is going to be a challenge for our entire field .
what is five billion dollars to the united states ?
what did we spend in afghanistan this year ?
how many trillions ? ( applause ) when the country cares about something , we 'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye .
the real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about .
i dare say it 's a pittance , what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems .
so once we do that , i 'll no longer be angry . ( laughter ) so , you guys , help me get there .
thank you all very much . thank you .
geoffrey canada : well , you know , john , 100 percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school .
a hundred percent of them went to college .
last i heard we had 93 percent accepted to college .
so that 's just how this goes . ( applause ) jl : so how do you stick with them after they leave high school ?
gc : well , you know , one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids , the same kids , these same vulnerable kids , when you get them in school , they drop out in record numbers .
`` they harass you , right ? they call you , they say , `` '' i want to see your grades . how 'd you do on that last test ? ''
what are you talking about that you want to leave school ?
`` and you 're not coming back here . '' '' so a bunch of my kids know you ca n't come back to harlem because geoff is looking for you . ''
`` they 're like , `` '' i really ca n't come back . '' '' no . you 'd better stay in school . ''
but i 'm not kidding about some of this , and it gets a little bit to the grit issue .
please give it up for him one more time .
but when we met , barack was a community organizer .
but you have everything you need .
all of us are makers .
( applause )
we get ever more vulnerable .
well , can we guard against such risks by regulation ?
it 's like the drug laws — we try to regulate , but ca n't .
and the global village will have its village idiots , and they 'll have a global range .
two and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced , and the communities will take 20 to 30 years to recover and billions of economic losses .
it 's a game changer .
and do n't just think about the uavs .
so we need marine vehicles .
bujold was used extensively at the world trade center to go through towers 1 , 2 and 4 .
and just to see the world trade center from bujold 's viewpoint , look at this .
it 's not making them more heat-resistant .
what the robots give you , what they give the experts , is data .
so it 's the data .
everybody can see the data .
and i would like to know what the audience is , and so who of you ever ate insects ?
( laughter ) but still , you 're not representing the overall population of the earth . ( laughter )
because there 's 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
why not eat insects ? well first , what are insects ?
insects are animals that walk around on six legs .
there 's six million species of insects on this planet , six million species .
there 's a few hundreds of mammals — six million species of insects .
in fact , if we count all the individual organisms , we would come at much larger numbers .
but if we would count all the individuals , and we take an average weight of them , it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on earth .
there was an estimation , a conservative estimation , a couple of years ago that the u.s. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year .
well we know that that was not a cheap war .
what do they do ?
they control pests , and they 're food for animals .
they 're at the start of food chains .
small animals eat insects .
even larger animals eat insects .
if you go out for dinner , like in a fish restaurant , where you can select which fish you want to eat , you can select which insects you would like to eat .
that 's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we 're eating , like a cow or a pig or a sheep .
more than 1,000 species — an enormous variety .
well we 've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally , but i can tell you that every one of you is eating insects , without any exception .
tomato soup , peanut butter , chocolate , noodles — any processed food that you 're eating contains insects , because insects are here all around us , and when they 're out there in nature they 're also in our crops .
some fruits get some insect damage .
in fact , why would we put these balls in the soup , there 's meat in there anyway ?
( laughter ) in fact , all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of .
so anything is a good protein source already .
`` now you may say , `` okay , so we 're eating 500 grams just by accident . '' ''
we 're even doing this on purpose .
the surimi sticks [ of ] crabmeat , or is being sold as crab meat , is white fish that 's being dyed with cochineal .
it 's being produced in large amounts , 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the canary islands in peru , and it 's big business .
one gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros .
so it 's a very precious thing that we 're using to dye our foods .
where , at the moment , we have something between six and seven billion people , it will grow to about nine billion in 2050 .
that means that we have a lot more mouths to feed , and this is something that worries more and more people .
and if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
and we eat quite a lot of it .
in the developed world it 's on average 80 kilograms per person per year , which goes up to 120 in the united states and a bit lower in some other countries , but on average 80 kilograms per person per year .
but it 's increasing enormously .
in china in the last 20 years , it increased from 20 to 50 , and it 's still increasing .
so if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average , and a third of the world population is living in china and in india , we 're having an enormous demand on meat .
they have the same share that we have .
we could do with much , much less — and i know , i 've been a vegetarian for a long time , and you can easily do without anything .
you 'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway .
but then there 's a lot of problems that come with meat production , and we 're being faced with that more and more often .
they 're even models in medicine , and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human .
this has happened in the netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak .
you get a new disease that can be deadly .
( laughter ) and there 's the conversion factor .
with 10 kilograms of input , you can get either one or nine kg . of output .
we 're not taking the bonus yet .
we 're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .
( laughter ) and there 's the environment .
so less waste .
so you have less waste , and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung .
`` ( laughter ) now there 's a big `` '' if , '' '' of course , and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality . ''
well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein , or fat , or vitamins , it 's very good .
so that 's four points for insects .
so the question is , why not eat insects ?
even if you do n't like it , you 'll have to get used to this because at the moment , 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock .
and if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent , we 're not going to make it that way .
and then 80 percent of the world already eats insects , so we are just a minority — in a country like the u.k. , the usa , the netherlands , anywhere .
on the left-hand side , you see a market in laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night .
so people there are eating them , not because they 're hungry , but because they think it 's a delicacy .
it 's just very good food .
it has many benefits .
who would n't like to eat a shrimp ?
there are a few people who do n't like shrimp , but shrimp , or crabs , or crayfish , are very closely related .
`` in fact , a locust is a `` '' shrimp '' '' of the land , and it would make very good into our diet . ''
so why are we not eating insects yet ?
that 's why we 're changing the perception of insects .
and i 'm working very hard with my colleague , arnold van huis , in telling people what insects are , what magnificent things they are , what magnificent jobs they do in nature .
if we die out , the insects will continue very happily .
and maybe by 2020 , you 'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you 're going to eat .
and they 're being made in the most wonderful ways .
a dutch chocolate maker .
( music ) ( applause ) so there 's even a lot of design to it .
( laughter ) well in the netherlands , we have an innovative minister of agriculture , and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .
and when she got all the ministers of agriculture of the e.u .
so why not eat insects ?
you should try it yourself .
a couple of years ago , we had 1,750 people all together in a square in wageningen town , and they ate insects at the same moment , and this was still big , big news .
so you can try it yourself today , and i would say , enjoy .
( applause ) bruno giussani : look at them first . look at them first .
marcel dicke : it 's all protein .
bg : that 's exactly the same [ one ] you saw in the video actually .
and it looks delicious .
md : thank you .
( applause )
and secondly , where did the leprosy bacteria come from ?
now you do n't need a phd to see that that leaves four percent for the rest of diversity .
so that begs the question : who is the human genome project actually for ?
so how many of you would be shocked to learn that 95 percent of clinical trials have also exclusively featured individuals of european ancestry ?
now despite this history of distrust , i still believe that indigenous people can benefit from genetic research .
it 's huge .
but what if you could sequence genomes on the fly ?
100 years later in kalaupapa , we now have the technology to sequence leprosy bacteria in real time , using mobile genome sequencers , remote access to the internet and cloud computation .
indigenomics is about science for the people by the people .
and for those on the outside , just as father damien did , the research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture or die trying .
shalom . sat sri akal .
so i want to talk to you about two things tonight .
number one : teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard .
who here has had surgery ?
did you want it ?
keep your hands up if you wanted an operation .
in particular , nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain , that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school , that leave a big scar .
now , this type of surgery is hard , and it starts by putting people to sleep , putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen , blowing them up like a balloon , sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen — it 's dangerous stuff — and taking instruments and watching it on a tv screen .
this is the real thing . there 's no blood .
and you can see how focused the surgeons are , how much concentration it takes .
you can see it in their faces .
it 's hard to teach , and it 's not all that easy to learn .
surgeons are not made either .
there are no little tanks where we 're making surgeons .
we build on that and we take people , hopefully , to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant .
and when they do all of that for about five years , they get the coveted board certification .
if you need surgery , you want to be operated on by a board-certified surgeon .
you get your board certificate , and you can go out into practice .
and eventually , if you 're lucky , you achieve mastery .
now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the american board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified .
it 's not a lecture , it 's not a course , it 's all of that plus a high-stakes assessment .
and are we talking about just people here in the u.s. and canada ?
so to lift this education and training worldwide is a very large task , something i 'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world .
sages does surgery all over the world , teaching and educating surgeons .
we need to make the world a smaller place .
and one of the tools i like personally is using video .
so i was inspired by a friend .
this is allan okrainec from toronto .
and he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing .
so here 's allan teaching an english-speaking surgeon in africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery .
very inspiring .
but for this examination , which is really hard , we have a problem .
it 's the primary harvard medical school teaching facility .
we have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages , and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital .
it 's a big labor-intensive effort .
we need to employ technology to assist us in this quest .
at our hospital we see everybody from harvard professors to people who just got here last week .
and there is n't always a translator available .
we need a universal translator .
one of the things that i want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world .
here in the united states we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world .
maybe we have something to learn as well .
so here 's what we think we want to do : imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously .
and it has to be bi-directional .
it 's a big task .
because we need a lexicon . what is a lexicon ?
a lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain .
i need to have a health care lexicon .
we 're working with the folks at ibm research from the accessibility center to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator .
it starts with a framework system where when the surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology , we then add another technology to do video conferencing .
but we do n't have the words yet , so we add a third technology .
we get the words up in a window and then apply the magic .
and we currently have access to eleven language pairs .
more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place .
and i 'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that do n't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful .
narrator : fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery .
students may display captions in their native language .
`` steven schwaitzberg : if you 're in latin america , you click the `` '' i want it in spanish '' '' button and out it comes in real time in spanish . ''
but that 's the lectures .
so we 're going to take it one step further ; we 've brought my friend allan back .
this is how you hold the needle .
grab the needle at the tip .
it 's important to be accurate .
orient your loop this way .
very good oscar . i 'll see you next week .
i can think of a million uses for a tool like this .
as we think about intersecting technologies — everybody has a cell phone with a camera — we could use this everywhere , whether it be health care , patient care , engineering , law , conferencing , translating videos .
this is a ubiquitous tool .
in order to break down our barriers , we have to learn to talk to people , to demand that people work on translation .
thank you very much .
( applause )
it looks very much like the apollo pictures that are very well known .
this is pretty amazing .
i 'm not really sure when this picture was taken .
in my lab , we develop tools to travel not only in space but also through time .
the kind of question we 're asking is is it possible to build something like google maps of the past ?
can i add a slider on top of google maps and just change the year , seeing how it was 100 years before , 1,000 years before ?
can i make a facebook of the middle ages ?
`` maybe we can just say , `` '' no , it 's not possible . '' '' or , maybe , we can think of it from an information point of view . ''
vertically , you have the time .
and horizontally , the amount of digital information available .
if we want to build something like google maps of the past , or facebook of the past , we need to enlarge this space , we need to make that like a rectangle .
how do we do that ?
i can extract information from these .
of course , the more you go in the past , the less information you will have .
so , it might not be enough .
i can extrapolate .
if i take a log book , i can consider , it 's not just a log book of a venetian captain going to a particular journey .
i can consider it is actually a log book which is representative of many journeys of that period .
i 'm extrapolating .
so if we want to construct a time machine , we need two things .
the venice time machine , the project i 'm going to talk to you about , is a joint project between the epfl and the university of venice ca'foscari .
there 's something very peculiar about venice , that its administration has been very , very bureaucratic .
at the archivio di stato , you have 80 kilometers of archives documenting every aspect of the life of venice over more than 1,000 years .
you have every boat that goes out , every boat that comes in .
you have every change that was made in the city .
this is all there .
we are setting up a 10-year digitization program which has the objective of transforming this immense archive into a giant information system .
in particular , traditional optical character recognition method that can be used for printed manuscripts , they do not work well on the handwritten document .
if you have a very good model of a language which is used , if you have a very good model of a document , how well they are structured .
and these are administrative documents .
if you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets where a smaller subset actually shares similar features , then there 's a chance of success .
actually probably 10 billion events can be extracted from this archive .
and this giant information system can be searched in many ways .
you can reconstruct that journey , visualize it in many different ways .
so the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the european level .
but you can even do other things , because in these maritime routes , there are regular patterns .
you can go one step beyond and actually create a simulation system , create a mediterranean simulator which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing , which would enable us to have questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner .
`` `` '' if i am in corfu in june 1323 and want to go to constantinople , where can i take a boat ? '' '' probably we can answer this question with one or two or three days ' precision . ''
`` `` how much will it cost ? '' ''
of course , you understand , the central scientific challenge of a project like this one is qualifying , quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process .
there are errors everywhere , errors in the document , it 's the wrong name of the captain , some of the boats never actually took to sea .
there are errors in translation , interpretative biases , and on top of that , if you add algorithmic processes , you 're going to have errors in recognition , errors in extraction , so you have very , very uncertain data .
so how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies ?
the system should allow for that , because we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty , which is really new for this type of giant databases .
again , venice is extraordinary for that .
with the millions of visitors that come every year , it 's actually one of the best places to try to invent the museum of the future .
it 's really a question of scale .
we see projects which are much beyond any single research team can do , and this is really new for the humanities , which very often take the habit of working in small groups or only with a couple of researchers .
when you visit the archivio di stato , you feel this is beyond what any single team can do , and that should be a joint and common effort .
`` so what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of `` '' digital humanists '' '' that are going to be ready for this shift . ''
i thank you very much .
so when i was eight years old , a new girl came to join the class , and she was so impressive , as the new girl always seems to be .
she had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case , super strong on state capitals , just a great speller .
and then i did it .
i gave everybody a row of d 's and i gave myself a row of a 's , just because i was there , you know , might as well .
i do n't understand why i felt so great doing it .
i felt great .
i was never caught .
we know babies suffer from jealousy .
for that , we have to go to fiction , because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration .
`` there goes high school reading lists , because we 're losing `` '' sound and the fury , '' '' we 're losing `` '' gatsby , '' '' `` '' sun also rises , '' '' we 're losing `` '' madame bovary , '' '' `` '' anna k. '' '' no jealousy , no proust . and now , i mean , i know it 's fashionable to say that proust has the answers to everything , but in the case of jealousy , he kind of does . ''
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
we think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea .
we forget how pitiless he is .
i do n't know what cat gut is , but let 's assume it 's formidable .
let 's look at why they go so well together , the novel and jealousy , jealousy and proust .
is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
when we feel jealous , we tell ourselves a story .
we tell ourselves a story about other people 's lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they 're designed to make us feel terrible .
you know , proust 's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him .
it 's a hungry emotion . it must be fed .
and what does jealousy like ?
`` he says , `` '' a woman whom we need , who makes us suffer , elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us . '' '' is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ? ''
and does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way ?
does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement ?
does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ?
freud would write about this later .
one day , freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him .
and freud says , it 's something strange about this guy , because he 's not looking at what his wife is doing .
because she 's blameless ; everybody knows it .
but he 's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing , unintentional behaviors .
[ freud ] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife 's unconscious .
the novel is very good on this point .
in fact , the more intensely jealous we are , the more we become residents of fantasy .
and this is why , i think , jealousy does n't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things .
a 52-year-old michigan woman was caught creating a fake facebook account from which she sent vile , hideous messages to herself for a year .
for a year . a year .
and she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend 's new girlfriend , and i have to confess when i heard this , i just reacted with admiration .
( laughter ) because , i mean , let 's be real .
what immense , if misplaced , creativity . right ?
this is something from a novel .
this is something from a patricia highsmith novel .
she is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of american letters .
take tom ripley , her most famous character .
but what do we do ? we ca n't go the tom ripley route .
and it 's a pity , because we live in envious times .
does the novel show us a way out ? i 'm not sure .
so let 's do what characters always do when they 're not sure , when they are in possession of a mystery .
let 's go to 221b baker street and ask for sherlock holmes .
when people think of holmes , they think of his nemesis being professor moriarty , right , this criminal mastermind .
so lestrade needs his help , resents him , and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries .
`` we 're proud of you . '' '' and he says that there 's not a man at scotland yard who would n't want to shake sherlock holmes ' hand . ''
it seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry , not emotion .
you know , one minute holmes is on the other side from lestrade .
suddenly , lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he 's resented .
what if jealousy really is a matter of geometry , just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another ?
so while we wait for that to happen , let us remember that we have fiction for consolation .
fiction alone demystifies jealousy .
fiction alone domesticates it , invites it to the table .
and look who it gathers : sweet lestrade , terrifying tom ripley , crazy swann , marcel proust himself .
we are in excellent company .
thank you .
( applause )
it did this by staring at a single field in the sky , this one , with all the tiny boxes .
it was looking for what astronomers call a transit .
and so the team at nasa had developed very sophisticated computers to search for transits in all the kepler data .
and so we launched the citizen science project called planet hunters to have people look at the same data .
the human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition , sometimes even better than a computer .
and so it was on , the classic human versus machine gamble .
on this graph on the left-hand side you have the amount of light , and on the bottom is time .
and so , for example , let 's take jupiter .
planets do n't get much bigger than jupiter .
a few years ago , planet hunters were sifting through data looking for transits , and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star kic 8462852 .
they said and object like jupiter would make a drop like this in the star 's light , but they were also saying it was giant .
you see , transits normally only last for a few hours , and this one lasted for almost a week .
they were also saying that it looks asymmetric , meaning that instead of the clean , u-shaped dip that we saw with jupiter , it had this strange slope that you can see on the left side .
this seemed to indicate that whatever was getting in the way and blocking the starlight was not circular like a planet .
and then in march of 2011 , we see this .
we described this feature as both smooth and clean .
and again , after this , not much happens until february of 2013 .
these dips have variable shapes .
some are very sharp , and some are broad , and they also have variable durations .
some last just for a day or two , and some for more than a week .
and there 's also up and down trends within some of these dips , almost like several independent events were superimposed on top of each other .
and at this time , this star drops in its brightness over 20 percent .
this means that whatever is blocking its light has an area of over 1,000 times the area of our planet earth .
this is truly remarkable .
and so the citizen scientists , when they saw this , they notified the science team that they found something weird enough that it might be worth following up .
and the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery , they joined along for the ride watching science in action firsthand .
first , somebody said , you know , what if this star was very young and it still had the cloud of material it was born from surrounding it .
and so somebody else said , well , how about a huge swarm of comets that are passing by this star in a very elliptical orbit ?
well , it ends up that this is actually consistent with our observations .
but i agree , it does feel a little contrived .
you see , it would take hundreds of comets to reproduce what we 're observing .
but of all the bad ideas we had , this one was the best .
`` and so we decided to give it a catchy title , and we called it : `` '' where 's the flux ? '' '' i will let you work out the acronym . ''
and he was saying that with kepler 's extreme precision , it could actually detect alien megastructures around stars , but it did n't .
`` and then i showed him this weird data that our citizen scientists had found , and he said to me , `` '' aw crap , tabby . ''
`` now i have to rewrite my paper . '' '' so yes , the natural explanations were weak , and we were curious now . ''
so together , we convinced a colleague of ours who works on seti , the search for extraterrestrial intelligence , that this would be an extraordinary target to pursue .
now , you may be wondering , ok , tabby , well , how do aliens actually explain this light curve ?
these giant megastructures , like ginormous solar panels , are called dyson spheres .
it 's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things , but you can think of it this way .
the earth-moon distance is a quarter of a million miles .
you can see how it would produce anomalies in the data such as uneven , unnatural looking dips .
but it remains that even alien megastructures can not defy the laws of physics .
another idea that 's one of my personal favorites is that we had just witnessed an interplanetary space battle and the catastrophic destruction of a planet .
( laughter ) you can see how this quickly captures your imagination .
we 're in a situation that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we do n't understand or an alien technology we do n't understand .
either way , there is something new and really interesting to discover .
thank you .
i live and work from tokyo , japan .
but — and it 's a pretty big but — we forget .
but is , in fact , about the art of delegation .
and it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation .
let me give you another example of delegation .
so , it turns out the street is a never-ending source of inspiration for us .
we negotiate that through strategies .
now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence , our life , immediately and repeatedly .
what 's missing ? what would i like to know ?
how can i apply this in my life ?
so we need to think about it here .
it 's very positive .
oftentimes , we think that we have to relate new knowledge to prior knowledge .
think about things in images , write things down that way .
`` i just got through reading `` '' the great gatsby , '' '' and i have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head , so my own version . ''
the last one is organization and support .
we are meaning-making machines . it 's what we do .
we try to make meaning out of everything that happens to us .
and the last one is support .
everything we do is an approximation of sophistication .
if we 're not processing life , we 're not living it .
the greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden .
if we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest , we see that sub-saharan africa is the worst hit region by hiv/aids .
but there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease , because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who do n't have diagnostic services , you end up creating a problem of drug resistance .
the problem is that , what begins as a tragedy in the third world could easily become a global problem .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , as well as the teachers who taught me , to hiv/aids .
back in the day , computers used to fill this entire room , and people actually used to work inside the computers .
and i 'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world , in the third world countries .
the good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories .
so , right now , we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips .
a close look at how the technology works : these are channels that are about the size of a human hair — so you have integrated valves , pumps , mixers and injectors — so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system .
for each patient , we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient .
so this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the third world at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place .
i invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality .
( applause )
i ran across other things .
i believe in time ; very important .
and i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside .
there 's this great piece in the atlantic .
we 've all had really great conversations .
number one : do n't multitask .
number three : use open-ended questions .
let them describe it . they 're the ones that know .
do that . err on the side of caution .
if they 're talking about having lost a family member , do n't start talking about the time you lost a family member .
listen .
when i 'm talking , i 'm in control .
`` we listen with the intent to reply . '' '' one more rule , number 10 , and it 's this one : be brief . ''
and honestly , i think it 's what makes me a better host .
you do the same thing .
but it 's not that simple .
this is the complication .
it happened three times , every 50-60 years .
because they have injected huge productivity improvement .
it 's rather simple : in order to grow , you need to be producing more , putting more into our economy .
this means either more labor or more capital or more productivity .
this did help productivity for a while .
weird .
it will be 25 percent in 10 years .
these robots are working for us right now .
then there 's additive manufacturing , 3d printing .
let 's take a real example .
the results ?
but actually , the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution goes much beyond productivity .
the new manufacturing revolution makes it possible .
3d printers instantaneously produce any customized design .
it will create a huge macroeconomic shift .
first , our factories will be relocated into our home markets .
the change will be drastic .
globalization will enter a new era .
when you think about that , the old model was pretty much insane .
this fourth manufacturing revolution is a chance for all of us .
because simple answers may emerge .
and it is .
and yet , it feels natural to us now .
we did n't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later .
we were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son — my husband , orlando , and i and our family .
and when i saw it — and yet , through the shock , the terrible shock , and the terrible explosion in our lives , literally , we were not vengeful .
and a couple of weeks later when zacarias moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , and the u.s. government called for a death penalty for him , if convicted , my husband and i spoke out in opposition to that , publicly .
through that and through human rights groups , we were brought together with several other victims ' families .
`` someday i want to meet that woman when i 'm stronger . '' '' i was still in deep grief ; i knew i did n't have the strength . ''
i knew i would find her someday , or we would find each other .
because , when people heard that my son was a victim , i got immediate sympathy .
so we met in november 2002 , and aicha will now tell you how that came about .
and i asked the organization of human rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims .
she was the only mother in the group .
i suffered a lot as a mother .
but she knows where he is .
i do n't know if he 's alive . i do n't know if he 's tortured .
i do n't know what happened to him .
for all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change .
it 's not against women , it 's for us , for us women , for our children .
this is why i 'm here in front of you .
but we were all so nervous .
`` `` why does she want to meet us ? '' ''
and then she was nervous .
`` `` why did we want to meet her ? '' ''
`` i know what it is to suffer , and i feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and punished . '' '' but she reached out to us in that way , and it was , i 'd like to say , it was an ice-breaker . ''
by the end of the afternoon — it was about three hours after lunch — we 'd felt as if we 'd known each other forever .
now what i learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she 's had .
i never had met someone with such a hard life , from such a totally different culture and environment from my own .
and i feel that we have a special connection , which i value very much .
`` and i think it 's all about being afraid of the other , but making that step and then realizing , `` '' hey , this was n't so hard . ''
you must be tolerant .
you have to fight against violence .
and i hope that someday we 'll all live together in peace and respecting each other .
( applause )
so i sort of feel happy that i 'm still astonished by it .
a nanometer is a billionth of a meter .
my area is the atomic nucleus , which is the tiny dot inside an atom .
they are very happy with their balls-and-sticks models of molecules .
it does n't really require much in the way of quantum mechanics to explain it .
it is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas that explain the world of the very small .
it 's a fuzzy world .
but in everyday life , we can forget about it .
because once you put together trillions of atoms , that quantum weirdness just dissolves away .
quantum biology is n't this obvious .
quantum biology is about looking for the non-trivial — the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics — and to see if they do , indeed , play an important role in describing the processes of life .
here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness of the quantum world .
well , if you saw tracks like that you 'd guess it was some sort of stunt , of course .
but in the quantum world , this happens all the time .
particles can behave like spread-out waves .
it 's almost like magic .
well , one man begged to differ with this idea .
`` in 1944 , he wrote a book called `` '' what is life ? '' '' it was tremendously influential . ''
it influenced francis crick and james watson , the discoverers of the double-helix structure of dna .
i want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones .
the box on the left shows the wavelike , spread-out distribution of a quantum entity — a particle , like an electron , which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall .
this is n't speculation , by the way .
the particles fuse together , and the sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling .
enzymes , those workhorses of life , the catalysts of chemical reactions — enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells , by many , many orders of magnitude .
enzymes help this take place .
this is research that 's been carried out back in the 80s , particularly by a group in berkeley , judith klinman .
the two strands of dna , the double-helix structure , are held together by rungs ; it 's like a twisted ladder .
so if you zoom in , what they 're doing is holding these large molecules — nucleotides — together .
the two white balls in the middle are protons , and you can see that it 's a double hydrogen bond .
one prefers to sit on one side ; the other , on the other side of the two strands of the vertical lines going down , which you ca n't see .
they can jump over to the other side .
if the two strands of dna then separate , leading to the process of replication , and the two protons are in the wrong positions , this can lead to a mutation .
quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking .
it 's the quantum skier .
the idea is that the photon , the particle of light , the sunlight , the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule , is then delivered to what 's called the reaction center , where it can be turned into chemical energy .
and in getting there , it does n't just follow one route ; it follows multiple pathways at once , to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat .
quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell .
my third and final example is the most beautiful , wonderful idea .
it 's also still very speculative , but i have to share it with you .
embracing otherness .
when i first heard this theme , i thought , well , embracing otherness is embracing myself .
and the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me , and it 's given me an insight into the whole notion of self , which i think is worth sharing with you today .
well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly .
it 's like that initial stage is over — oneness : infancy , unformed , primitive .
it 's no longer valid or real .
what is real is separateness , and at some point in early babyhood , the idea of self starts to form .
but the self is a projection based on other people 's projections .
is it who we really are ?
the self that i attempted to take out into the world was rejected over and over again .
and my panic at not having a self that fit , and the confusion that came from my self being rejected , created anxiety , shame and hopelessness , which kind of defined me for a long time .
but in retrospect , the destruction of my self was so repetitive that i started to see a pattern .
the self changed , got affected , broken , destroyed , but another one would evolve — sometimes stronger , sometimes hateful , sometimes not wanting to be there at all .
the self was not constant .
and how many times would my self have to die before i realized that it was never alive in the first place ?
my dad is white from cornwall , and my mom is black from zimbabwe .
because the self likes to fit , to see itself replicated , to belong .
but my skin color was n't right .
my self became defined by otherness , which meant that , in that social world , i did n't really exist .
`` and i was `` '' other '' '' before being anything else — even before being a girl . ''
i was a noticeable nobody .
another world was opening up around this time : performance and dancing .
that nagging dread of self-hood did n't exist when i was dancing .
i 'd literally lose myself .
and i was a really good dancer .
i would put all my emotional expression into my dancing .
and at 16 , i stumbled across another opportunity , and i earned my first acting role in a film .
i can hardly find the words to describe the peace i felt when i was acting .
my dysfunctional self could actually plug in to another self , not my own , and it felt so good .
`` dr. phyllis lee gave me my interview , and she asked me , `` '' how would you define race ? '' '' well , i thought i had the answer to that one , and i said , `` '' skin color . '' '' `` `` so biology , genetics ? '' '' she said . ''
`` `` '' because , thandie , that 's not accurate . ''
on the other hand , my definition of self just lost a huge chunk of its credibility .
but what was credible , what is biological and scientific fact , is that we all stem from africa — in fact , from a woman called mitochondrial eve who lived 160,000 years ago .
my desire to disappear was still very powerful .
and of course i did .
i still believed my self was all i was .
we 've created entire value systems and a physical reality to support the worth of self .
look at the industry for self-image and the jobs it creates , the revenue it turns over .
but there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection — and that thing is oneness , our essence .
and that can happen with awareness — awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self-hood .
it happens when i dance , when i 'm acting .
i 'm earthed in my essence , and my self is suspended .
all my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel — that feeling of oneness .
and when i 'm acting a role , i inhabit another self , and i give it life for awhile , because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment .
and i 've played everything from a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery to secretary of state in 2004 .
and i honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure .
i always wondered why i could feel others ' pain so deeply , why i could recognize the somebody in the nobody .
i thought i lacked substance , and the fact that i could feel others ' meant that i had nothing of myself to feel .
the thing that was a source of shame was actually a source of enlightenment .
and when i realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function , a funny thing happened .
in fact , i respect my self and its function .
because , hey , if we 're all living in ourselves and mistaking it for life , then we 're devaluing and desensitizing life .
and in that disconnected state , yeah , we can build factory farms with no windows , destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .
we 've just been insanely trying to figure out how to live with each other — billions of each other .
we knew it from the day we were born .
it was just three days away .
why should there be order in war ?
so we looked at a few more conflicts .
i 'm here to give you your recommended dietary allowance of poetry .
and let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about .
because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act .
but when i was united states poet laureate — and i love saying that .
when i was him back then , i was approached by j. walter thompson , the ad company , and they were hired sort of by the sundance channel .
and the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them .
and the poem , if it 's written with the ear , already has been set to its own verbal music as it was composed .
and surely , if you 're reading a poem that mentions a cow , you do n't need on the facing page a drawing of a cow .
i think more influential than emily dickinson or coleridge or wordsworth on my imagination were warner brothers , merrie melodies and loony tunes cartoons .
and this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places .
when i was poet laureate , there i go again — i ca n't help it , it 's true — ( laughter ) i created a poetry channel on delta airlines that lasted for a couple of years .
and my sense is , it 's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves and more into public life .
start a meeting with a poem . that would be an idea you might take with you .
when you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio or on a cereal box or whatever , it happens to you so suddenly that you do n't have time to deploy your anti-poetry deflector shields that were installed in high school .
so let us start with the first one .
`` ( video ) narration : `` '' budapest . '' '' my pen moves along the page like the snout of a strange animal shaped like a human arm and dressed in the sleeve of a loose green sweater . ''
bc : so that makes it seem a little easier .
( applause ) writing is not actually as easy as that for me .
but i like to pretend that it comes with ease .
`` one of my students came up after class , an introductory class , and she said , `` '' you know , poetry is harder than writing , '' '' which i found both erroneous and profound . ''
( laughter ) so i like to at least pretend it just flows out .
`` he says that , `` '' if at first you do n't succeed , hide all evidence you ever tried . '' '' ( laughter ) the next poem is also rather short . ''
poetry just says a few things in different ways .
`` and i think you could boil this poem down to saying , `` some days you eat the bear , other days the bear eats you . '' ''
and it uses the imagery of dollhouse furniture .
`` ( video ) narration : `` '' some days . '' '' some days i put the people in their places at the table , bend their legs at the knees , if they come with that feature , and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs . ''
very funny .
long ago , you kissed the names of the nine muses good-bye and you watched the quadratic equation pack its bag .
and even now , as you memorize the order of the planets , something else is slipping away , a state flower perhaps , the address of an uncle , the capital of paraguay .
whatever it is you are struggling to remember , it is not poised on the tip of your tongue , not even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen .
`` ( applause ) bc : the next poem is called `` '' the country '' '' and it 's based on , when i was in college i met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine . ''
he lived , and still does , in rural vermont .
i lived in new york city .
and when i would go up to the country , he would teach me things like deer hunting , which meant getting lost with a gun basically — ( laughter ) and trout fishing and stuff like that .
( laughter ) and in that way we traded lore with each other .
the poem that 's coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that i had a very hard time , at first , processing .
`` so the little poem is called `` '' the dead . '' '' ( video ) narration : `` '' the dead . '' '' the dead are always looking down on us , they say . ''
they watch the tops of our heads moving below on earth .
it took a long time — i mean , it 's rather uncommon to have this marriage — a long time to put those two together .
and schlepping is an ancient and honorable art .
( laughter ) i just have time to read a more recent poem to you .
`` it 's called `` '' to my favorite 17-year-old high school girl . '' '' `` `` do you realize that if you had started building the parthenon on the day you were born , you would be all done in only one more year ? ''
so never mind ; you 're fine just being yourself .
you 're loved for just being you .
for some reason i keep remembering that lady jane grey was queen of england when she was only 15 .
but then she was beheaded , so never mind her as a role model .
( laughter ) a few centuries later , when he was your age , franz schubert was doing the dishes for his family , but that did not keep him from composing two symphonies , four operas and two complete masses as a youngster . ( laughter )
we think you 're special just being you — playing with your food and staring into space .
thanks . ( applause )
it 's my job to make sure the collection stays okay , and that it grows , and basically it means i collect dead animals .
the building was a true bird-killer .
you may know that birds do n't understand the concept of glass . they do n't see it , so they fly into the windows and get killed .
( laughter ) and in those days , i developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass .
and this is what i saw when i looked out of the window .
this is the dead duck . it flew against the window .
it 's laying dead on its belly .
both are of the male sex .
and then this happened .
`` i said , `` '' something 's wrong here . '' '' one is dead , one is alive . that must be necrophilia . ''
homosexual necrophilia .
after 75 minutes — ( laughter ) — i had seen enough , and i got hungry , and i wanted to go home .
so i went out , collected the duck , and before i put it in the freezer , i checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex .
and here 's a rare picture of a duck 's penis , so it was indeed of the male sex .
( laughter ) i mean , it 's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine , but to share this among your peers is something different .
`` so after six years , my friends and colleagues urged me to publish , so i published `` '' the first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard . '' '' and here 's the situation again . ''
a is my office , b is the place where the duck hit the glass , and c is from where i watched it .
`` i got a phone call from a person called marc abrahams , and he told me , `` '' you 've won a prize with your duck paper : the ig nobel prize . '' '' and the ig nobel prize — ( laughter ) ( applause ) — the ig nobel prize honors research that first makes people laugh , and then makes them think , with the ultimate goal to make more people interested in science . ''
and there are nine other winners who get prizes .
dan , where are you ? dan ariely ?
( laughter ) so here 's my one minute of fame , my acceptance speech , and here 's the duck .
this is its first time on the u.s. west coast .
i 'm going to pass it around .
( laughter ) yeah ?
please note it 's a museum specimen , but there 's no chance you 'll get the avian flu .
in the first place , people started to send me all kinds of duck-related things , and i got a real nice collection .
this is a moose .
it 's a moose trying to copulate with a bronze statue of a bison .
this is in montana , 2008 .
this is the netherlands , 2011 .
these are cane toads in australia .
please note that this is necrophilia .
these are pigeons in rotterdam .
i mean , the question i ask myself , why does this happen in nature ?
and here you see a dead duck .
another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds .
he sees an intruder in his territory , and it 's coming all the time and he 's there , so there is no end to it .
and i thought , in the beginning — i studied this bird for a couple of years — that , well , should n't the brain of this bird be damaged ?
it 's not . i show you here some slides , some frames from the video , and at the last moment before he hits the glass , he puts his feet in front , and then he bangs against the glass .
and as you know , or as you may not know , this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world .
so i hope to see you next year in rotterdam , the netherlands , for dead duck day .
thank you .
( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you .
despite all this focus on the healthy self , general public knowledge of the anatomical self is lacking .
how many of you here made it through anatomy ?
i , like you , spent countless hours memorizing hundreds of structures .
but what happens when we 're done studying ?
but before i get into showing you how artists are reclaiming anatomy today , it 's important to understand how art influenced anatomy in the past .
imagine seeing that in your textbooks today .
disembodied limbs were often posed in literal still lives .
and medical illustration is still art .
nothing can elicit an emotional response — from joy to complete disgust — more than the human body .
artistry can also be seen in the repair and recovery of the human body .
his serious figure drawings are often layered in elements of humor .
it 's always wonder , amazement and wanting to explore .
fear of anatomy and guts is a learned reaction .
but if you look closely , you 'll notice that it lacks a brain .
and this creates a 3-d illusion that lends itself very well to painting directly on the human skin .
but he 's doing just fine .
his x-rays show how culture can come to have an anatomy of its own , and conversely how culture can become part of the anatomy of a person .
thank you .
it may still be , for all i know .
it 's a tiny , tiny thing .
that 's the world people actually want .
and i 'd be wrong to dis that completely .
moving over , we come , of course , to consultancy .
so what accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that , i 'm not sure .
that 's called trivia .
but there 's a fourth thing .
the problem is anonymous companies .
and a lot of my school teachers did n't appreciate it much either .
you see , since the age of about five i 've always asked the question , but why ?
but why is blood red ?
and little did i realize that this question would become the basis of everything i would do .
and from that slightly crazy question , over two decades and many campaigns later , including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war , from that crazy question , global witness is now an 80-strong team of campaigners , investigators , journalists and lawyers .
and we 're doing this because so many of the countries rich in natural resources like oil or diamonds or timber are home to some of the poorest and most dispossessed people on the planet .
and much of this injustice is made possible by currently accepted business practices .
and one of these is anonymous companies .
that 's twice the country 's health and education budget combined .
or political corruption in sarawak , malaysia , which has led to the destruction of much of its forests .
this truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight .
whether it 's the ruthless mexican drugs cartel , the zetas , who use anonymous companies to launder profits while their drugs-related violence is tearing communities apart across the americas .
anonymous companies have even come to light in the recent revolution in the ukraine .
now , at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens but here 's the thing , shockingly , my own hometown , london , and indeed the u.k. , is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company .
do you know , in some states across america you need less identification to open up a company than you do to get a library card , like delaware , which is one of the easiest places in the world to set up an anonymous company .
these are the companies that can set your one up for you , and remember , it 's all legal , routine business practice .
but do n't worry , it does n't have to be your name .
and then finally , give your company a name add a few more details and make your payment .
but there you are , in 10 minutes of online shopping you can create yourself an anonymous company .
and not only is it easy , really , really easy and cheap , it 's totally legal too .
well , that 's no problem either .
well , an example that really haunts me is one i came across recently .
and it 's that of a horrific fire in a nightclub in buenos aires about a decade ago .
it was the night before new year 's eve .
over 200 people died .
and as the victims ' families and the city and the country reeled in shock , investigators tried to find out who was responsible .
why should this secrecy be such an accepted business practice ?
anonymous companies might be the norm right now but it was n't always this way .
companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line .
my wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good .
so what might this look like ?
well , there is only one way .
there is such an opportunity right now .
it 's going to be a springboard for our global campaigning .
and to succeed we will all together need to help and push our politicians , because without that , real far-reaching , world-shifting change just is n't going to happen .
this is n't just a dry policy issue .
this is about being on the right side of history .
let 's just do it , let 's end anonymous companies .
we went about getting evidence of what was going on .
their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod .
in this , we are all together .
how we imagine our happiness , that differs from one another , but it 's already a lot that we have all in common , that we want to be happy .
now my topic is gratefulness .
many people would say , well , that 's very easy .
why ? because they are grateful .
now , we can ask , what do we really mean by gratefulness ?
i appeal to your own experience .
we experience something that 's valuable to us .
and it 's really given .
these two things have to come together .
it has to be something valuable , and it 's a real gift .
that 's how gratefulness happens .
we can not only have grateful experiences .
grateful living , that is the thing .
it 's a gift . you have n't earned it .
if we did n't have this present moment , we would n't have any opportunity to do anything or experience anything , and this moment is a gift .
moment by moment , we can be grateful for this gift .
does that mean that we can be grateful for everything ?
certainly not .
learning patience , for instance .
we have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint , but is more like a marathon .
that takes patience . that 's difficult .
that 's an opportunity that is given to us .
they make something out of life .
we miss the opportunity because we do n't stop .
every time i turned on the faucet , i was overwhelmed .
every time i clicked on the light , i was so grateful .
but after a while , this wears off .
so i put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet , and every time i turned it on , water .
you open your ears . you open your nose .
stop , look , and then go , and really do something .
mostly it 's the opportunity to enjoy , but sometimes it 's something more difficult .
the future of the world will be a network , not a pyramid turned upside down .
we could n't understand why it mushroomed .
thank you .
but the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations is obviously extreme . and that 's why timing is everything .
and this is one way to do technology forecasting : get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn .
we want to be the first to do it , for the geeks who appreciate that , we 'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger .
you can see in 1997 , we put linux on the cover .
and that 's one way that we try to time technology trends .
and these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be , and maybe how you can do something about it .
the first is the critical price .
the first stage in a technology 's advance is that it 'll fall below a critical price .
after it falls below a critical price , it will tend , if it 's successful , to rise above a critical mass , a penetration .
and then finally , a lot of technologies commoditize .
i 'd like to demonstrate what i mean by this by telling the story of the dvd , which is a technology which has done all of these .
the dvd , as you know , was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive . but you can see that by 1998 , it had fallen below 400 dollars , and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold .
and it started to take off . and you can see that the units started to trend up , the hidden inflection point — it was taking off .
the next thing it hit , a year later , was critical mass . in this case , 20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household .
suddenly you have a dvd in the house ; you 've got high-quality digital video ; you have a reason to have a big-screen television ; you have a reason for dolby 5.1 surround-sound .
and maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them , and bring the rest of your entertainment in .
the next phase it hit was displacement .
and here too , you can see the implications in the world at large .
netflix was right — the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that the video-rental stores could n't .
and then finally , dvds are approaching free .
there 's a company called apex , a no-name chinese firm , who has , several times in the past year , been the number-one dvd seller in america . their average price , for last year , was 48 dollars .
but they 're getting very , very cheap , and look at the interesting implication of it . as they get cheaper , the premium brands , the sonys and such , are losing market share , and the no-names , the apexes , are gaining them .
they 're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there — they 're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods .
but i think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers , these intersections , are interesting to think about .
start with gene sequencing .
as you probably know , gene sequencing — in a large part , because it 's built on computers — is falling in price at a kind of a moore 's law-like level .
it is now possible — will be possible , and if craig venter indeed comes today , he may tell you something about this — to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year .
you know , our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer .
each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test .
here 's another technology that 's approaching a critical price .
in january 2000 , the price was 10,000 dollars , or 27 dollars a day .
the generics came in , first in brazil and elsewhere , and the effect was just dramatic on pricing .
and what 's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity , if you look at the correlation between these two , as the anti-retrovirals come down , the number of people you can treat goes radically up . and the clinton foundation and who believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 — two million in sub-saharan africa .
and the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that .
linux is another good example .
interestingly , it 's done a crossover before , but not the crossovers that matter .
the crossover that 's going to matter is the one with the blue .
that is , i imagine , what people in redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about .
( laughter ) another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars .
i do n't know whether anybody has a prius 2004 , but they 're fantastic .
and if you look at the trends here , by about 2008 — and i do n't think this is a crazy forecast — they 'll be two percent of auto sales .
two percent is n't 20 percent , but in the car business , which is slow moving , that 's huge ; that 's arrival .
and what 's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you 've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry .
it 's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years .
and once you have electric motors , you can do anything : you can change the structure of the car in any way you want .
look at these numbers . they launched it in august of last year ; they already have nearly four million registered users — that 's critical mass .
you 're looking at ip taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards . this is a tipping point — if malcolm 's here , forgive me — and it 's going to change the economics , and the speed , and the players in the industry .
free is really , you know , the gift of silicon valley to the world .
it 's an economic force ; it 's a technical force .
it is abundance , as opposed to scarcity .
free is probably the most interesting thing .
i mean , you know , the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes , and hollywood 's worried as well .
they 're facing a force that they have n't faced before .
and finally , i 'll give you one last example of free — perhaps the most powerful of all . i mentioned fiber optics — their abundance tends to make things free .
india had , still has , a regulated phone system and so did we .
it was surprisingly non-innovative , moved very slowly , but then there was just so much fiber out there , you could n't hold back , and look how quickly the price fell .
it 's seven cents a minute , in many cases .
and the consequence of cheap phone calling , free phone calling , to india , is the pissed-off programmer , is the outsourcing .
( laughter ) imagine seeing your life , 30 years of it , go by , and it was , to say the least , for me , quite a shocking experience .
it 's not that i was fidel castro and i could talk for two hours , or bucky fuller .
entebbe happened .
it was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system at the time .
and then something for me changed pretty profoundly .
this is perhaps the best picture i have .
look at the kid on the left , and so on .
nn : you 're going to give me extra time ?
nicholas , what is your prediction ?
( laughter ) nn : thank you for asking .
so once it 's in your bloodstream , it basically goes through it and gets into the brain , and when it knows that it 's in the brain in the different pieces , it deposits it in the right places .
so it 's ingesting .
ca : we will check it out .
well thank you for that .
nn : thank you .
a lot less .
how did it come about ?
few high schoolers had access to computers in those days .
after sleeping in the mud at woodstock , i went off to mit to go to college , where to make money , i worked on the multics project .
i was one of the few percentage of students who had a background in computer programming .
( laughter ) now , at harvard , we learned by the case method .
in fact , here 's my calculator .
and i could type some numbers in , and circle it , and press the sum button .
and it lets you find solutions to those problems much less expensively .
i went to a video terminal connected to harvard 's time-sharing system and got to work .
the first thing i thought was the programmer way of doing it .
and if you had to type the formula in yourself , you 'd know what to do .
print was n't working yet , so i had to copy everything down .
it came in packaging that looked like this .
and the rest , as they say , is history .
here 's that classroom .
they put up a plaque to commemorate what happened there .
thank you .
millions of people were in severe need of help .
i was free , i was happy .
but then by the end of the decade , the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement .
in 1979 , i witnessed my first military coup .
we the children had gathered at a friend 's house .
there was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background , and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole .
the firing squad aimed , fired — the general was dead .
now this was being broadcast live .
now europe came as a shock to me , and i think i started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in .
i wanted to blend in like a chameleon .
and it worked , or so i believed .
so here i was in 2008 wondering where i was in my life .
i was playing the violent african , the african terrorist .
and i had become ashamed of the other , the african in me .
and fortunately i decided in 2008 to return to ghana , after 28 years of absence .
and i realized that , when i 'd left the country , free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream .
and now that i 'd returned , that dream had become reality , though a fragile reality .
was what was happening in ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me ?
i mean , nor had ghana , even though we had been trying very hard .
in the late 50s , ghana and singapore had the same gdp .
i mean , today , singapore is a first world country and ghana is not .
`` and i asked one of the voters , i said , `` '' whom are you going to vote for ? '' '' and he said , `` '' i 'm sorry , i ca n't tell you . '' '' he said that his vote was in his heart . ''
and i understood , this was their election , and they were n't going to let anyone take it away from them .
the candidates were back on the road ; they were campaigning .
the rhetoric of the candidates , of course , changed .
the heat was on .
and then the cliche came to haunt us .
inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control .
we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets .
the army started firing their guns . people were scrambling .
and my heart sank , because i thought , here we are again .
and not only that , i am documenting it — documenting my own cultural shortcomings .
`` we want peace . '' '' and i realized it had to come from the people . ''
the sounds of the voices were harmonious .
it could be , by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace .
now here 's an interesting comparison .
but instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide , ghana honored democracy and its people .
the electoral commissioner declared , with the consent of the parties , to run an unprecedented second re-run .
the defeated candidate gave up power and made way for ghana to move into a new democratic cycle .
i mean , at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy , they did not abuse their power .
the belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep , proving that the african is capable of governing himself .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i 'm still searching for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
in a way , i feel like my life is kind of a result of some wise choices and decisions they 've made .
and just like that , another of their decisions was to keep me and my siblings connected to our roots .
i got to see the beautiful tradition and its magic fade in front of me when i saw that the birth of a girl child was celebrated with sadness , when women were told to have patience as their main virtue .
honor killings is a custom where men and women are suspected of having relationships before or outside of the marriage , and they 're killed by their family for it .
a custom that kills did not make any sense to me , and i knew i had to do something about it this time .
i was not going to cry myself to sleep .
i was 16 — i started writing poetry and going door to door telling everybody about honor killings and why it happens , why it should be stopped , and raising awareness about it until i actually found a much , much better way to handle this issue .
it was so big it looked as if it was going to take up half of the only room we had , and had so many pieces and wires that needed to be connected .
but it was still the most exciting thing that has ever happened to me and my sisters .
being the oldest of eight kids , i got to use it the last , and that was after i had washed the dishes , cleaned the house , made dinner with my mom , and put blankets on the floor for everyone to sleep , and after that , i would run to the computer , connect it to the internet , and have pure joy and wonder for 10 to 15 minutes .
it became enormous in just a few months .
media was connecting to us .
i was devastated .
as a teenager , i was blaming myself for everything that happened .
there were two big reasons why our campaign had failed big time .
the policies of a country do not necessarily always affect the tribal and rural communities .
it was devastating — like , oh , we ca n't actually do something about this ?
so this time , we were like , we are going to do something different .
we are going to use strategy , and we are going to go back and apologize .
yes , apologize .
nobody believed us .
and so it began .
we started the center .
women have so much status that we have not been hearing , that they have not been hearing , and we needed to tell them that they need to know where their rights are and how to take them by themselves , because they can do it and we ca n't .
we went into the village . we would mobilize the community .
after six months , we would connect these women to loans and to markets where they can become local entrepreneurs in their communities .
it means skilled and confident women .
all we had to do was remove the barriers that surrounded them , and that 's what we decided to do .
and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
make it go in the other direction .
teacher : do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing .
who 's got the apple ?
`` and they say , `` '' oh , yeah . constant acceleration . ''
galileo , by the way , did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute .
thank you .
and it 's not that machines are taking over .
and really you do the same thing .
sir , you caught the giraffe .
audience member : 10 of hearts .
helder guimarães : 10 of hearts .
ninety percent of everything is crap , so there 's this to prove that sturgeon was correct .
well , the truth is , why is the majority of everything bad ?
i 'll give you a clear little example , something that people used to do around the turn of the century — not this century , the other one .
( laughter ) but that 's okay , i understand why .
we stop thinking too soon .
not only that , if instead of using my hand with the fingers , i use my hand closed into a fist , that makes this even a little bit more interesting .
sturgeon may be correct .
sir , what was the card ?
there 's this to prove that things can always change — the 10 of hearts .
and this is the best secret i 've ever experienced .
`` it starts with a deck of cards onto the table , an old man and a claim , `` i will not touch the deck till the end . '' ''
go ahead , throw it in any direction so that you can find someone else at random .
`` he said , `` '' it could be a club or a spade , '' '' and my answer was ... ''
hg : indeed ! it was a high spade .
since it 's a high spade , it could be a nine , a 10 , a jack , king , queen or the ace of spades .
and my answer was ...
audience member 2 : the king .
hg : the king of spades , indeed .
and the first number i thought of was ...
audience member 2 : 17 .
`` the old man only said one more thing : `` this is the end . '' ''
i knew that he was going to touch the deck .
everything that you 're about to see is exactly as it looked .
the old man stood up , he left .
but he left his notebook that was there from the beginning .
and when i picked it up , that was the best secret i 've ever experienced .
we are defined by the secrets we keep and by the secrets we share .
sir , i 'm going to ask you , do you have , with you , a united states $ 1 bill ?
audience member 3 : i think so .
do you have it ?
audience member 3 : yes . hg : yes ! perfect .
first of all , i want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper clip .
so i want to make sure it 's exactly the same bill .
now not only that , i want you to take the paper clip and put it around the bill .
do you mind , can you help me with this ?
and do you mind , can you take some cards and shuffle ?
you can shuffle cards in a variety of ways .
do you mind doing that for me , sir ?
please cut and complete .
a deck of cards cut and shuffled by one , two , three , four and five people .
i 'm going to try .
is that your signature ?
audience member 3 : yes it is .
hg : i want you to see very clearly that i 'm going to open your bill and reveal a small secret that we created .
and that 's my show .
`` and a few years after i left , i went back , and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me — said , `` '' dan , i have a fantastic new treatment for you . '' '' i was very excited . i walked with him to his office . ''
let me tell you , this was a strange way to shave , because i thought about it and i realized that the way i was shaving then would be the way i would shave for the rest of my life — because i had to keep the width the same .
`` what would happen then ? '' '' `` `` oh , do n't worry about it , '' '' he said . ''
do you enjoy looking non-symmetric ?
do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?
`` do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently ? '' '' none of those happened . ''
`` where was this guilt trip coming from ? '' '' and he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already , and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing . ''
( laughter ) now you probably think that this guy 's a schmuck .
right , that 's what he seems like .
but let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
a few years ago , i was running some of my own experiments in the lab .
so we had one group that i hoped their performance would be very high , another group that i thought their performance would be very low , and when i got the results , that 's what we got — i was very happy — aside from one person .
there was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly .
and he pulled the whole mean down , destroying my statistical significance of the test .
so i looked carefully at this guy .
and i remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
`` who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? '' '' but a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , `` '' what would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ? ''
but you know , these stories , and lots of other experiments that we 've done on conflicts of interest , basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me .
the first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces .
and i 'm sure that it 's something that we all recognize , and we see that it happens .
the most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives .
i was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .
i was n't doing something bad .
the positive perspective , i think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail , we can actually hope to fix things .
( applause )
why grow homes ? because we can .
right now , america is in an unremitting state of trauma .
and for 18 years , those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey .
i use quotes or poetry .
today , i do n't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall .
i thought it was a fabulous idea , for about one day or two , and i 've never thought about it since .
because i had to read everything twice or thrice , to begin to understand what was written there .
and then , that little seed that had been sown in 1996 , started germinating .
and one day , i found myself entering through my boss ' office and quitting my job to dedicate myself to this .
and so , what did i find out , right off the start ?
we have that group of red people in level 1 , which is the lowest in literacy [ rate ] .
that is , if they do n't have to read anything too new or too different , they will manage .
but , for example , if they work in a factory and a new machine arrives and they have to read the machine 's manual to be able to work with it , they ca n't do it anymore .
then we have a few more that can handle documents , as long as they are not too complex , and we have 5 % of the population that can handle really complex documents .
now , just so you do n't think this is normal , that over there is sweden .
while we have 20 % of people with the literacy considered essential for a daily basis , sweden has 75 % .
and looking at that , what did i realize ?
i realized we live in an apartheid of information .
that one is mr. domingos , my building 's doorkeeper . mr. domingos started to read at the age of 27 , so , he falls in that yellow group that we have seen a little while ago .
`` from time to time , i 'm arriving home and he says : `` miss sandra ! `` ; `` yes , mr . domingos . '' ''
`` `` '' here is a little letter . '' '' so , the deal is : when mr. domingos or someone in the family or in the neighbourhood receives something that they do n't understand , they come to me and i help them to translate it . ''
`` and so , that time he said to me like this : `` oh , miss sandra , i 'm about to throw this away , but check it if this is important . '' ''
it was almost thrown away into the garbage , mr. domingos ' letter .
in that same year , i 've found out , only 20 % of people had used these surgery-bank checks .
they lost the opportunity to have the surgery they needed .
`` now , maybe , you are sitting there and thinking : `` yeah , poor mr. domingos ... bad luck , is n't it ? me ? ! i 'm in the green ones . '' ''
`` `` '' i 'm absolutely sure that i 'm one of the green ones . i was selected to come to ted ! hum ? '' '' ( laughter ) so the deal is : i have here some texts to read to you and i 'm going to see what color are you when i finish reading . ''
and this one is really good . this one , i signed a renting contract to the new office on friday and i laughed my head off .
and these documents are not written by experts to experts , as the ones from the string theory .
these are the renting contracts , the package leaflet of the medicines .
because , if i ca n't understand , what happens ?
i 'm going to give you an example of mistakes that were committed , bad decisions made for not being able to understand documents .
do you remember the subprime crisis that took place in the united states ?
people signed those loans to buy houses , without truly understanding what they were signing .
because if they knew what they were signing , they 'd know that as soon as the interest rate started to rise , the monthly payment would also increase , they would n't be able to pay anymore and they would end up without a house .
so , the rest , after that , next , everything crumbled down and we know the rest .
i do n't think so . so , how do you solve this problem , this such big difference between the literacy [ rate ] of the portuguese , that is down here , and the complexity of the public documents , those ones we need to understand in our daily lives , sorry , that are up here ?
`` so , the first think that comes to mind is , `` '' if literacy is down here , let 's make it rise '' '' — is n't it ? ''
let 's , let 's ... of course we will , of course we will educate people .
so , besides increasing literacy [ rate ] , and for now , it 's much more important to reduce the complexity of documents and simplify the language .
when i talk about simplifying the language . notice !
it 's communicating in a simple and clear way , enabling our reader to understand it at first glance .
what do you prefer ? before or after ?
there is n't much doubt , is there ?
so , how is this achieved ? how can you make the state and companies communicate with citizens in a language they can understand at first glance ?
for example , sweden and the united states introduced , last year , a legislation that forces the state to communicate with people in a language they can understand .
`` and you think , `` '' well , that 's normal . they are countries that are a bit ahead . ''
`` `` '' sweden , maybe , much more than the united states . ''
`` `` it would be nice if in our country there was also legislation towards that , would n't it be ? '' ''
so it would . and there is ! since 1999 .
but the thing is : it is not applied . so , the question , the path of going through legislation , enforcing through legislation , works in those countries where laws are made to be applied .
now , there is another way , the way of marketing .
it 's the path of civil movements , that are based in a mentality shift .
`` in countries where this really went forward — do you remember the english label , of the `` '' plain english campaign '' '' ? — this is all based on a consumers ' movement . ''
so , what does it take for that civic movement to happen ?
on this side we have : understanding is a right .
no ! demand to understand . ask .
`` i know that this is not easy . turn to the gentleman in the little suite and say : `` look here , this contract , this part , what does this mean ? '' ''
what do you teach your children when they have doubts in school ?
`` no , you do n't , right ? you say : `` look , when you do n't understand , you put your hand up in the air and ask the teacher until you are cleared . '' ''
and that is exactly what we have to do , as consumers and citizens .
`` then , there 's the other side , which is : `` '' okay , these awful documents `` '' which are in circulation , they do n't grow on trees . ''
maybe , among this big group , some persons ...
i do n't know , some lawyers , some public employees — i 'm not asking you to identify yourselves , but i ask you to search your own conscience .
`` and you 'll say : `` '' ah , that 's because there is a reason , here ! '' '' dear friends , i already heard all the reasons . ''
`` there are thousands of reasons . they go like these : `` ah , it 's the house 's culture '' ; `` oh , my boss ! '' ''
`` `` '' we ca n't lower the level '' '' ; bla , bla , bla ... ''
i 've seen all of this . these are excuses .
a while ago , they told us about einstein .
( laughter ) you write with respect and without paternalism .
grandma has a lot to do . she is not going to read three pages to get to the main idea .
next , use short sentences , because grandma , like anyone of us , if you make very long sentences , she gets to the end and she ca n't remember what you said in the beginning , anymore .
alright ? it 's easy !
it has this mission : to change the way how public communication is made .
what do we do ?
`` we are going to launch this year a collection of `` '' claro '' '' guides , that is , we are going to pick very , very , very complex subjects and put them simple . ''
`` we are going to start with the `` '' claro '' '' guide of justice . ''
`` i think it is an area ... that comes in handy . ( applause ) and now i 'm going to follow manuel [ forjaz ] 's advise . if it 's time to ask , whoever wants to sponsor the `` '' claro '' '' guide of justice — i do n't know ... ''
for example , the edp foundation , or ... ha ? — come talk to me later .
so , we 'll give prizes to the worst and to the best .
it wants to put two little things in your heads .
the first one : demand to understand . do n't be shy .
thank you . ( applause )
talking about empowerment is odd , because when we talk about empowerment , what affects us most are the stories .
but yet , it was simple .
information technology grows in an exponential manner .
and if we did that , then google would back this .
here is our founding meeting .
i 'd like you to imagine the world anew .
the cities are shown shining bright .
this is how our world is now connected .
this is çatalhöyük , one of the world 's first cities .
if you look carefully at the map of the city , you 'll see it has no streets , because streets are something we invented .
it changes by trial and error .
we work out slowly and gradually how to live in better ways .
and the world has changed incredibly quickly most recently .
again , the underlying map is the map of world population , but over it , you 're seeing arrows showing how we spread out of africa with dates showing you where we think we arrived at particular times .
i have to redraw this map every few months , because somebody makes a discovery that a particular date was wrong .
we are learning about ourselves at an incredible speed .
you can see the great chinese famine .
but this is the map of the world changed again to make area large , the further away people are from each area .
and you can see areas in which there is a great deal of rainfall as well .
and you see the monsoons moving around the planet , and the planet almost appears to have a heartbeat .
this is the areas that we will rely on most for rice and maize and corn .
you will have seen this map of the world before .
where the lights are shining up is where people live .
everywhere has the same density of people on this map .
and the world did n't end .
there are a huge number of good news stories in the world .
a few years ago , the number of babies dying in their first year of life in the world fell by five percent in just one year .
you are not told about the population slowing down .
you are not told about the world becoming more connected .
you are not told about the incredible improvements in understanding .
you can see that india is in the center of this world .
you can see that europe is on the edge .
and we in exeter today are on the far edge of the planet .
we are living in a stabilizing world , an urbanizing world , an aging world , a connecting world .
thank you very much .
and that is , why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior ?
now , many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question , and as a field we 've made a tremendous amount of headway and we understand a lot about this .
what i 'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that i 've been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the propensity to save .
oecd countries , by and large , you should think about these as the richest , most industrialized countries in the world .
and by joining the oecd , they were affirming a common commitment to democracy , open markets and free trade .
so all the way over on the left of this graph , what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter of their gdp every year , and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdp per year .
holding down the right flank of the oecd , all the way on the other side , is greece .
linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now .
and then i 'll draw the connection between these two behaviors .
and something i realized quite early on was that the chinese language forced me to speak about and — in fact , more fundamentally than that — ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways .
you understood exactly what i just said in english .
i would n't have been able to convey so little information .
`` what my language would have forced me to do , instead of just telling you , `` '' this is my uncle , '' '' is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information . ''
`` why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modify what i 'm saying to say , `` '' it will rain , '' '' or `` '' it 's going to rain . '' '' it 's simply not permissible in english to say , `` '' it rain tomorrow . '' '' in contrast to that , that 's almost exactly what you would say in chinese . ''
actually , no .
it is the only germanic language that requires this .
could how you speak about time , could how your language forces you to think about time , affect your propensity to behave across time ?
and what that means is that every time you discuss the future , or any kind of a future event , grammatically you 're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it 's something viscerally different .
now suppose that that visceral difference makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak .
if that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically , that 's going to make it easier to save .
well , what i did with that was to access the linguistics literature .
this is a pocket of futureless language speakers in northern europe .
interestingly enough , when you start to crank the data , these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be , by and large , some of the world 's best savers .
what you see is that these bars are systematically taller and systematically shifted to the left compared to these bars which are the members of the oecd that speak futured languages .
over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation .
what i 'm going to show you , though , is something that i 've been engaging in for a year , which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets that we have access to as economists , and i 'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences , hoping to get this relationship to break .
and just in summary , no matter how far i push this , i ca n't get it to break .
one way to imagine that is i gather large datasets from around the world .
( laughter ) so imagine that you 're a retired household in belgium and someone comes to your front door .
would you happen to have a hallway that 's more than 10 meters long ?
and what i 'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure , and then i 'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels .
well i 'm going to match families on country of birth and residence , the demographics — what sex , their age — their income level within their own country , their educational achievement , a lot about their family structure .
it 's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment of finding two families both of whom live in brussels who are identical on every single one of these dimensions , but one of whom speaks flemish and one of whom speaks french ; or two families that live in a rural district in nigeria , one of whom speaks hausa and one of whom speaks igbo .
now even after all of this granular level of control , do futureless language speakers seem to save more ?
yes , by the time they retire , futureless language speakers , holding constant their income , are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings .
can we push this data even further ?
yes , because i just told you , we actually collect a lot of health data as economists .
now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings ?
well , think about smoking , for example .
smoking is in some deep sense negative savings .
what we should expect then is the opposite effect .
i could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find .
it 's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect is n't present .
thank you very much .

a computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression , but for the most part , that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones .
and i 'd like to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live .
a few years ago , i got a call from a luxury fashion store called barneys new york , and the next thing i knew , i was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays .
each of the shoes has magnets in it , and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes around .
and the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit , and a researcher from a science education center in australia decided to study this exhibit and try to figure out what was going on .
and she found that the physical objects that people were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit , and were helping people learn in a social way .
but the thing that struck me about all of these different projects is that they really had to be built from scratch , down to the level of the electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the software .
so my first attempt at this was at the mit media lab with professor hiroshi ishii , and we built this array of 512 different electromagnets , and together they were able to move objects around on top of their surface .
so i wanted to build something where you could have this kind of interaction on any tabletop surface .
they 're these special wheels that can move equally easily in all directions , and when you couple these robots with a video projector , you have these physical tools for interacting with digital information .
so here 's an example of what i mean .
so if we want to tweak the color , we just enter the color mode , and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color , or if we want to adjust the audio , then we get two different dials for that , these physical objects .
so the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that 's designed in software .
and this is a mapping application for disaster response .
so you have these physical objects that represent police , fire and rescue , and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where to go , and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of those units in the real world .
this is a video chat application .
and if we move it in a way that does n't really make sense with the underlying molecular simulation , we get this physical feedback where we can actually feel these physical handles pulling back against us .
so feeling what 's going on inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction .
there 's no touchscreen .
there 's no technology visible at all .
thank you .
( applause )
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
no kidding .
( applause )
you 'll see why in a second .
baby diapers have interesting properties .
they can swell enormously when you add water to them , an experiment done by millions of kids every day .
( laughter ) but the reason why is that they 're designed in a very clever way .
it 's a special kind of material that , when you add water , it will swell up enormously , maybe a thousand times in volume .
but what we 're trying to do in my group at mit is to figure out if we can do something similar to the brain .
if we could get that , maybe we could have a better understanding of how the brain is organized to yield thoughts and emotions and actions and sensations .
now , our group at mit is trying to take a different point of view from the way neuroscience has been done over the last hundred years .
we 're designers . we 're inventors .
so what we 've learned over the first century of neuroscience is that the brain is a very complicated network , made out of very specialized cells called neurons with very complex geometries , and electrical currents will flow through these complexly shaped neurons .
furthermore , neurons are connected in networks .
they 're connected by little junctions called synapses that exchange chemicals and allow the neurons to talk to each other .
so , if you could zoom in to a neuron , and , of course , this is just our artist 's rendition of it .
what you would see are thousands and thousands of kinds of biomolecules , little nanoscale machines organized in complex , 3d patterns , and together they mediate those electrical pulses , those chemical exchanges that allow neurons to work together to generate things like thoughts and feelings and so forth .
each of these blobs that you see , or voxels , as they 're called , can contain millions and millions of neurons .
for centuries , they 've been used to look at things like bacteria .
you ca n't look at these tiny connections .
so if we want to make our ability to see the brain more powerful , to get down to the ground truth structure , we 're going to need to have even better technologies .
if it 's so darn complicated to zoom in to the brain , why ca n't we make the brain bigger ?
you would see those connections and get maps of the brain .
this could potentially be quite dramatic .
we brought a little demo here .
it 's much easier just to buy it off the internet than to extract the few grains that actually occur in these diapers .
i 'm going to put just one teaspoon here of this purified polymer .
ok. so a little bit of chemistry now .
if you could zoom in , it might look something like what you see on the screen .
they 're separated by distances that are around the size of a biomolecule .
we need to pull the molecules of the brain apart from each other , and to do that , we need to have a little handle that allows those polymers to bind to them and to exert their force .
and much like drawing a picture on a balloon , and then you blow up the balloon , the image is the same , but the ink particles have moved away from each other .
there 's one last trick .
so one kind of biomolecule might get a blue color .
another kind of biomolecule might get a red color .
and so forth .
we have here a little brain in a dish — a little piece of a brain , actually .
and the cool part is , because those polymers are so tiny , we 're separating biomolecules evenly from each other .
it 's a smooth expansion .
and of course , we can pinpoint , hopefully , the actual problems in the brain at a molecular level .
what if we could actually look into cells in the brain and figure out , wow , here are the 17 molecules that have altered in this brain tissue that has been undergoing epilepsy or changing in parkinson 's disease or otherwise being altered ?
if we get that systematic list of things that are going wrong , those become our therapeutic targets .
we can build drugs that bind those .
this is an actual biopsy from a human breast cancer patient .
it turns out that if you look at cancers , if you look at the immune system , if you look at aging , if you look at development — all these processes are involving large-scale biological systems .
but of course , the problems begin with those little nanoscale molecules , the machines that make the cells and the organs in our body tick .
so what we 're trying to do now is to figure out if we can actually use this technology to map the building blocks of life in a wide variety of diseases .
sometimes , it 's even guesswork .
we understood gravity ; we understood aerodynamics .
we knew how to build rockets .
the science risk was under control .
and my hope is , if we can turn biology and medicine from these high-risk endeavors that are governed by chance and luck , and make them things that we win by skill and hard work , then that would be a great advance .
thank you very much .
( applause )
in truth , i wondered if they were right .
ld : there was just one problem .
jc : one of the first countries that we traveled to was nepal .
ld : there we met prince manvendra .
sure , they had their struggles .
what we ultimately took away from our journey is , equality is not a western invention .
hi . this is my mobile phone .
a mobile phone can change your life , and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom .
this is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket .
hold it up .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
that 's a lot . almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
but today i will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
and i will talk about this .
these are 35,830 lines of information .
raw data .
and why are these informations there ?
this directive [ is ] called data retention directive .
this directive says that each phone company in europe , each internet service company all over europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users .
who calls whom ? who sends whom an email ?
we want self-determination in the digital age , and we do n't want that phone companies and internet companies have to store all this information about us .
so i asked my phone company , deutsche telekom , which was at that time the largest phone company in germany , and i asked them , please , send me all the information you have stored about me .
and i asked them once , and i asked them again , and i got no real answer . it was only blah blah answers .
but then i said , i want to have this information , because this is my life you are protocoling .
but deutsche telekom said , no , we will not give you this information .
because in the mean time , the german constitutional court ruled that the implementation of this e.u . directive into german law was unconstitutional .
so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c.d . inside .
and on the c.d. , this was on .
thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
at first i saw it , and i said , okay , it 's a huge file . okay .
because you can see where i am , where i sleep at night , what i am doing .
but then i said , i want to go out with this information .
so together with zeit online and open data city , i did this .
you can see every step i take .
and you can even see how i go from frankfurt by train to cologne , and how often i call in between .
all this is possible with this information .
first , it 's only like , i call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .
and then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
but you can see how your people are communicating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
you can see all of this .
you can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing . if you have access to this information ,
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
and this information is stored for at least six months in europe , up to two years .
like i said at the beginning , imagine that all those people on the streets of berlin in autumn of 1989 had a mobile phone in their pocket .
because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline .
they want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time .
but self-determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction .
you have to fight for it every day .
so , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it 's not outdated .
and if you do n't believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
i know you guys think of yourself as humans , and this is sort of how i think of you .
this is the vibrio fischeri molecule .
but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species .
it 's a very small , five-carbon molecule .
so , this book that i have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982 . ( laughter ) actually , it 's deceptively large .
there 's actually only about 20 people on each page , because we have the name , address and telephone number of every single person .
and , in fact , everybody 's listed twice , because it 's sorted once by name and once by email address .
i knew them both .
we did n't all know each other , but we all kind of trusted each other , and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network , and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things .
so just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community , let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days .
now , it just so happened that i got to register the third domain name on the internet .
so i could have anything i wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com .
maybe i should register a few extras just in case .
`` and then i thought , `` '' nah , that would n't be very nice . '' '' ( laughter ) that attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days , and in fact , it was n't just the people on the network , but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the internet itself . ''
if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department , but it obviously worked really well , and we all saw what happened with the internet .
but , of course , you could n't do it , because we do n't know the names of all the people with internet or email addresses , and even if we did know their names , i 'm pretty sure that they would not want their name , address and telephone number published to everyone .
and that means that it 's vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen , or certain kinds of deliberate attacks , but even the mistakes can be bad .
so , for instance , in all of asia recently , it was impossible to get youtube for a little while because pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring youtube in its internal network .
they did n't intend to screw up asia , but they did because of the way that the protocols work .
i 'll come back to that later .
all of a sudden , a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole internet , including a lot of the traffic between u.s. military installations , started getting re-routed through china .
imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
so if somebody really wanted to attack the united states or western civilization these days , they 're not going to do it with tanks .
what they 'll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the iranian nuclear facility .
nobody has claimed credit for that .
it did n't think of itself as being on the internet .
now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant .
and the way the internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places , and this one processor , because of a broken card , decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time .
so , in other words , it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it .
so of course , the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy , who would send it back in time and get it there super early , so every message in the internet started getting switched through this one node , and of course that clogged everything up .
everything started breaking .
the interesting thing was , though , that the sysadmins were able to fix it , but they had to basically turn every single thing on the internet off .
now , in fact , they could n't do it for a lot of reasons today .
one of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use ip protocol and use things like skype and so on that go through the internet right now , and so in fact we 're becoming dependent on it for more and more different things , like when you take off from lax , you 're really not thinking you 're using the internet .
when you pump gas , you really do n't think you 're using the internet .
most of them are n't based on the internet yet , but they 're starting to use the internet for service functions , for administrative functions , and so if you take something like the cell phone system , which is still relatively independent of the internet for the most part , internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions , and it 's so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well , they 're cheap , they 're repeated , and so on .
and so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other .
that 's crazy . it was never designed to do things like that .
they have an informed opinion , but it 's changing so quickly that even the experts do n't know exactly what 's going on .
and so right now , i think it 's literally true that we do n't know what the consequences of an effective denial-of-service attack on the internet would be , and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year , and worse next year , and so on .
but so what we need is a plan b .
there 's no clear backup system that we 've very carefully kept to be independent of the internet , made out of completely different sets of building blocks .
this does n't need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project .
it 's actually relatively simple to do , technically , because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground , existing wireless infrastructure .
so there 's been plenty of people , plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years , but it 's very hard to get people focused on plan b when plan a seems to be working so well .
`` so i think that , if people understand how much we 're starting to depend on the internet , and how vulnerable it is , we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist , and i think if enough people say , `` '' yeah , i would like to use it , i 'd like to have such a system , '' '' then it will get built . ''
it 's not that hard a problem .
it could definitely be done by people in this room .
and so i think that this is actually , of all the problems you 're going to hear about at the conference , this is probably one of the very easiest to fix .
thank you very much .
what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing ?
could we have fuel without fear ?
let 's see how .
four-fifths of the world 's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo .
so we need a new fire .
and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity , each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air .
but they 're really quite distinct .
their uses are quite concentrated .
and the rest of both runs factories .
so it needs refurbishment .
by 2050 though , it could become efficient , connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos , factories and buildings all relying on a modern , secure and resilient electricity system .
we can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply .
moreover , this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of congress and no new federal taxes , mandate subsidies or laws and running washington gridlock .
let me say that again .
i 'm going to tell you how to get the united states completely off oil and coal , five trillion dollars cheaper with no act of congress led by business for profit .
in other words , we 're going to use our most effective institutions — private enterprise co-evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions .
so let 's start by making autos oil free .
unfortunately , over the past quarter century , epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have .
lighter and more slippery autos need less force to move them , so their engines get smaller .
so these innovations together can transform automakers from wringing tiny savings out of victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies to the steeply falling costs of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other — namely ultralight materials , making them into structures and electric propulsion .
the sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates , that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones .
and just in the first two years the biggest of europe 's five feebate programs has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency .
the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers .
of course , computers and electronics are now america 's biggest industry , while typewriter makers have vanished .
america could lead this next automotive revolution .
currently the leader is germany .
also last year , bmw announced this carbon fiber electric car , they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries .
`` and they said , `` '' we do not intend to be a typewriter maker . '' '' audi claimed it 's going to beat them both by a year . ''
seven years ago , an even faster and cheaper american manufacturing technology was used to make this little carbon fiber test part , which doubles as a carbon cap .
( laughter ) in one minute — and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is .
they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos .
they can save lives because this stuff can absorb up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel .
if we made all of our autos this way , it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half saudi arabias , or half an opec , by drilling in the detroit formation , a very prospective play .
and all those mega-barrels under detroit cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel .
the same physics and the same business logic also apply to big vehicles .
but just the technological savings in heavy trucks can get to two-thirds .
and combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes , now on the drawing board , can save close to a trillion dollars .
instead of just seeing the travel grow , we can use innovative pricing , charging for road infrastructure by the mile , not by the gallon .
we can allow smart and lucrative growth models that help people already be near where they want to be , so they do n't need to go somewhere else .
and we can use smart it to make traffic free-flowing .
together , those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving , saving another 0.4 trillion dollars , plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively .
so 40 years hence , when you add it all up , a far more mobile u.s. economy can use no oil .
so to get mobility without oil , to phase out the oil , we can get efficient and then switch fuels .
the trucks could even use natural gas .
in fact , three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil , not in supply , but in demand .
and deutsche bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016 .
but the electrified vehicles do n't need to burden the electricity grid .
so the electrified autos make the auto and electricity problems easier to solve together than separately .
changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it .
most of it now is wasted and the technologies for saving it keep improving faster than we 're installing them .
so the unbought efficiency resource keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper .
over the next 40 years , buildings , which use three-quarters of the electricity , can triple or quadruple their energy productivity , saving 1.4 trillion dollars , net present value , with a 33 percent internal rate of return or in english , the savings are worth four times what they cost .
the key is a disruptive innovation that we call integrative design that often makes very big energy savings cost less than small or no savings .
integrative design can also increase energy savings in industry .
half of that runs pumps and fans .
for example , pumps , the biggest use of motors , move liquid through pipes .
but a standard industrial pumping loop was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy , not by getting better pumps , but just by replacing long , thin , crooked pipes with fat , short , straight pipes .
of course , it also shrinks the pumping equipment and its capital costs .
well , from the coal burned at the power plant through all these compounding losses , only a tenth of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow .
`` but now let 's turn those compounding losses around backwards , and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe saves 10 units of fuel cost , pollution and what hunter lovins calls `` '' global weirding '' '' back at the power plant . ''
and of course , as you go back upstream , the components get smaller and therefore cheaper .
typically our retrofit designs save about 30 to 60 percent of the energy and pay back in a few years , while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent with generally lower capital cost .
in fact , these solar power module costs have just fallen off the bottom of the chart .
such unregulated products could ultimately add up to a virtual utility that bypasses your electric company just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company .
renewables are no longer a fringe activity .
in 2010 , renewables other than big hydro , particularly wind and solar cells , got 151 billion dollars of private investment , and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity of nuclear power in the world by adding 60 billion watts in that one year .
that happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity that the world can now make every year — a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year .
in fact in this country , no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital , despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies .
so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants ?
but we only need to replace them once .
we 're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on , because they 're 24/7 , whereas wind and solar power are variable , and hence supposedly unreliable .
actually no generator is 24/7 . they all break .
and when a big plant goes down , you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds , often for weeks or months , often without warning .
hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they 're forecasted , integrated and diversified by both type and location .
that is how , for example , four german states in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent wind powered .
in america , our aging , dirty and insecure power system has to be replaced anyway by 2050 .
and whatever we replace it with is going to cost about the same , about six trillion dollars at present value — whether we buy more of what we 've got or new nuclear and so-called clean coal , or renewables that are more or less centralized .
but those four futures at the same cost differ profoundly in their risks , around national security , fuel , water , finance , technology , climate and health .
for example , our over-centralized grid is very vulnerable to cascading and potentially economy-shattering blackouts caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters or a terrorist attack .
that is , they can disconnect fractally and then reconnect seamlessly .
they think they need that ; how about the rest of us that they 're defending ?
traditionally utilities build a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants and a bunch of big gas plants and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables .
and i heretically suggested it could go down several-fold .
well that 's what 's actually happened so far .
but with today 's much better technologies , more mature delivery channels and integrative design , we can do far more and even cheaper .
`` and the results may at first seem incredible , but as marshall mcluhan said , `` '' only puny secrets need protection . ''
`` big discoveries are protected by public incredulity . '' '' now combine the electricity and oil revolutions , both driven by modern efficiency , and you get the really big story : reinventing fire , where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets can lead the united states completely off oil and coal by 2050 , saving 5 trillion dollars , growing the economy 2.6-fold , strengthening out national security , oh , and by the way , by getting rid of the oil and coal , reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent . ''
now if you like any of those outcomes , you can support reinventing fire without needing to like all of them and without needing to agree about which of them is most important .
this also turns out to be the best way to cope with global challenges — climate change , nuclear proliferation , energy insecurity , energy poverty — all of which make us less safe .
`` but as edgar woolard , who used to chair dupont , reminds us , `` '' companies hampered by old thinking wo n't be a problem because , '' '' he said , '' '' they simply wo n't be around long-term . '' '' i 've described not just a once-in-a-civilization business opportunity , but one of the most profound transitions in the history of our species . ''
we humans are inventing a new fire , not dug from below , but flowing from above ; not scarce , but bountiful ; not local , but everywhere ; not transient , but permanent ; not costly , but free .
and but for a little transitional tail of natural gas and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure , this new fire is flameless .
each of you owns a piece of that $ 5 trillion prize .
`` and our new book `` '' reinventing fire '' '' describes how you can capture it . ''
so with the conversation just begun at reinventingfire.com , let me invite you each to engage with us and with each other , with everyone around you , to help make the world richer , fairer , cooler and safer by together reinventing fire .
thank you .
and this is why the greatest designers are almost always the biggest dreamers and rebels and renegades .
at the time , all weapons were made by hand to different specifications .
and he did the same for daggers , axes , spears , shields and every other form of weaponry .
his formidably equipped army won batter after battle , and within 15 years , his tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering all its larger , richer , more powerful neighbors , to found the mighty chinese empire .
and the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their spoils , they needed to attack their enemies so brutally that they would surrender on sight .
so in other words , they could take the ships without wasting ammunition , or incurring casualties .
so edward teach redesigned himself as blackbeard by playing the part of a merciless brute .
he wore heavy jackets and big hats to accentuate his height .
he grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face .
he slung braces of pistols on either shoulder .
he even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight , so they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack .
nightingale was born into a rather grand , very wealthy british family , who were horrified when she volunteered to work in military hospitals during the crimean war .
once there , she swiftly realized that more patients were dying of infections that they caught there , in the filthy , fetid wards , than they were of battle wounds .
so she campaigned for cleaner , lighter , airier clinics to be designed and built .
back in britain , she mounted another campaign , this time for civilian hospitals , and insisted that the same design principles were applied to them .
the nightingale ward , as it is called , dominated hospital design for decades to come , and elements of it are still used today .
but by then , design was seen as a tool of the industrial age .
by the 20th century , this commercial ethos was so powerful , that any designers who deviated from it risked being seen as cranks or subversives .
he was the hungarian artist and designer whose experiments with the impact of technology on daily life were so powerful that they still influence the design of the digital images we see on our phone and computer screens .
he radicalized the bauhaus design school in 1920s germany , and yet some of his former colleagues shunned him when he struggled to open a new bauhaus in chicago years later .
moholy 's ideas were as bold and incisive as ever , but his approach to design was too experimental , as was his insistence on seeing it , as he put it , as an attitude , not a profession to be in tune with the times .
he was yet another brilliant design visionary and design activist , who was completely committed to designing a sustainable society in such a forward-thinking way that he started talking about the importance of environmentalism in design in the 1920s .
and yet , the geodesic dome , his design formula to build an emergency shelter from scraps of wood , metal , plastic , bits of tree , old blankets , plastic sheeting — just about anything that 's available at the time — is one of the greatest feats of humanitarian design , and has provided sorely needed refuge to many , many people in desperate circumstances ever since .
i began my career as a news journalist and foreign correspondent .
thank you , fellow ted design buffs .
and we 're living at a remarkable moment in design , because this is a time when the two camps are coming closer together .
because even very basic advances in digital technology have enabled them to operate increasingly independently , in or out of a commercial context , to pursue ever more ambitious and eclectic objectives .
so in theory , basic platforms like crowdfunding , cloud computing , social media are giving greater freedom to professional designers and giving more resources for the improvisational ones , and hopefully , a more receptive response to their ideas .
it can be used to monitor the hearts of patients in remote , rural areas .
arthur zang started working on the cardiopad eight years ago , in his final year at university .
and he is n't alone , because there are many other inspiring and enterprising designers who are also pursuing extraordinary projects of their own .
one is peek vision .
this is a group of doctors and designers in kenya , who 've developed an internet of things technology of their own , as a portable eye examination kit .
this was taken using satellite , so it 's got tremendous spatial resolution .
the equatorial regions are warm because there 's more sunlight .
and i 've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long .
sea level was 120 meters lower .
carbon dioxide [ levels ] were very much lower than they are today .
we do n't know .
you 'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy .
looks beautiful , right ?
here we are on our first dive of this particular cruise , plunging down into the ocean .
and we go down , and these are the kinds of things you see .
this is a beautiful holothurian as well .
you 're going to see a picture of one in a moment .
it 's small , about five centimeters high .
an organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years .
and as it grows , it takes in chemicals from the ocean .
and if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton , we can then go back , collect fossil specimens , and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past .
if you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up , this is about 100 microns across .
and we pick up all these corals , bring them back , we sort them out .
so on the left-hand image here , i 've taken a slice through a coral , polished it very carefully and taken an optical image .
you can see the density of the surface water in this animation by ryan abernathey .
we then found corals that are of an intermediate age , and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition .
this is a spectacular coral garden .
it 's just a beautiful place .
there are fossils in amongst , and now i 've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals that are down there .
about two thirds , i would guess , of the world is desertifying .
carbon goes back to the atmosphere .
we were wrong then , and we are wrong again .
we have never understood it .
but we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago ?
why has it accelerated lately ?
it has just come through four months of rain , and it 's now going into eight months of dry season .
so on this bit of grassland , we 'll do it , but just in the foreground .
it 's a little bit technical to explain here , but just that .
ca : well , i would love to — i mean , this such an interesting and important idea .
( hammer ) ( laughter ) ( microwave beeps ) ( laughter ) you probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road .
it 's made of asphalt , and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it 's raining a lot .
then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt .
it 's a noisy material , and if we produce roads like in the netherlands , very close to cities , then we would like a silent road .
it also has disadvantages , of course , and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur .
first you get one stone , then several more , and more and more and more and more , and then they — well , i will not do that . ( laughter ) but they can damage your windshield , so you 're not happy with that .
and finally , this raveling can also lead to more and more damage .
sometimes you can create potholes with that .
ha . he 's ready .
potholes , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
it 's a porous asphalt , like i said , so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones .
due to weathering , due to u.v . light , due to oxidation , this binder , this bitumen , the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink , and if it shrinks , it gets micro-cracks , and it delaminates from the aggregates .
if we can make this material self-healing , then probably we have a solution .
so then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it .
then what you do is you heat up the steel , you melt the bitumen , and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks , and the stones are again fixed to the surface .
today i use a microwave because i can not take the big induction machine here onstage .
so i put the specimen in , which i 'm now going to take out to see what happened .
so this is the specimen coming out now .
so i said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .
`` we tested a lot of specimens there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , `` '' well , that 's very interesting . we have to try that . '' '' so they donated to us a piece of highway , 400 meters of the a58 , where we had to make a test track to test this material . ''
several times we can repeat that .
so actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine — this is the big version we have made to go on the real road — if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .
and now you 're of course curious if it also worked .
actually , it still has to cool down first before i can show you that the healing works .
but i will do a trial .
let 's see . yeah , it worked .
( applause )
public space . this is a good public space .
so thank you very much .
and using these simple improvisations , today we can make a forest for a cost as low as the cost of an iphone .
it 's a horrifying fact .
and so , back to plastic .
and my job is to try to collect the best of each kid 's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work .
so we packed this prototype of a sensor , and we shipped it to bangladesh .
and so what we did with them is that we 'd discuss the data we collected that day , and talk about where we should be going next — strategy , itinerary , etc ...
but at the same time , it 's been increasingly frustrating because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done .
so plastic , oil and radioactivity are horrible , horrible legacies , but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies .
we can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions .
so citizen scientists , makers , dreamers — we must prepare the next generation that cares about the environment and people , and that can actually do something about it .
thank you .
and you need the fourth factor , which perhaps is the most important factor .
what ? ( laughter ) that really flipped me out .
i know what people think when they see this .
what happened to interacting with each other ?
i dream of technology on a human path .
i 'm talking about today .
now , this is important .
now , this is the perspective i apply to my work every single day .
the computer universe is both marvelous and primitive .
it 's a universe based on causality .
double click on an icon , that 's a cause .
open an application , that 's an effect .
that 's displacement of space .
so how do we get there ?
but how would that machine then interact with reality ?
and i can think of three ways .
move the dial one way , and you get reality .
move the dial the other way , and you get virtual reality .
and the world ?
jn : well , i 'm actually in three places .
but our dreams do n't have to end with making it just like being there .
we 're taking the first steps .
it 's a phenomenal time to be human .
thank you .
ak : and there 's holographic jeff norris .
jn : yes ?
ak : i 'll take a step back .
that 's my question for a hologram .
jn : thanks for the question .
hw : amazing . ok , jeff , please go away . thank you very much .
of course , the queen goes to her stud often to watch her horses ...
then suddenly , it started to get on front pages .
but then this changed suddenly .
it was led by felix dzerzhinsky .
it used all the imaginable instruments for getting information secretly , such as informers , or tapping phones , as you can see it on the picture here .
( applause ) bg : hubertus , thank you very much .
so how would you run a whole country without oil ?
it never left my brain .
the original thought i had : this must be ethanol .
so one , it has to be more convenient than a car .
alright ? that 's not something that we can finance or buy today .
so we 're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
on a random visit to tesla on some afternoon , i actually found out that the answer comes from separating between the car ownership and the battery ownership .
`` in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic `` batteries not included . '' ''
now it sounds crazy . but in some places around the world , like scandinavia , you already have that .
120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people .
then we looked at the question of the affordability .
we looked at the question , what happens when the battery is disconnected from the car .
what is the cost of that battery ?
we can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again .
20 miles per gallon that 's a buck 50 , a buck 60 a gallon .
that 's cheaper than today 's gasoline , even in the u.s .
in europe where taxes are in place , that 's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel .
that is an 80 cent gallon .
and pick the two best places — the one where you did n't need any range extension .
by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we 're going at right now .
that 's another 30 percent demand on oil .
that is another 25 million barrels a day .
in other words at some point when we 've recovered we go up to the peak .
and the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter .
right ? remember in the campaign : one million hybrid cars by 2015 .
that wo n't do much difference .
we have 10 million cars by region .
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
we forgot about the entire chain around us .
all this stuff that happens around .
the business model in which the money that is actually coming in , to drive the car — the minutes , the miles if you want , that you are all familiar with — subsidize the price of the car , just like cellphones . you 'll pay for the miles .
and some of it will go back to the car maker .
but our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars .
now when we 're looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers .
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year we ca n't stop thinking of padding co2 .
came from a source of energy that was immoral : human slaves .
and there was an argument . should we stop using slaves ?
`` and people said , `` '' well we need to take time to do it . ''
we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in israel that said we will end oil .
and now english is becoming the language of problem-solving .
larry page : well , thank you .
a simple wooden notice board .
and that means access to the internet .
it sounds totally crazy .
cr : it 's a balloon . lp : yeah , get access to the internet .
and that 's how this project got going .
it is security and privacy .
but i think , you know what , i look at that , i made that public , and i got all this information .
cr : so you 're talking about saving lives .
give me a sense of the philosophy of your own mind .
the principle of that for you is what ?
that had to be done by other people .
it took a long time .
what did those companies all do wrong ?
look at android .
it was a little startup we bought .
it 's time to start designing for our ears .
architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these .
it 's our health , our social behavior , and our productivity as well .
that 's interference . communication requires sending and receiving , and i have another whole tedtalk about the importance of conscious listening , but i can send as well as i like , and you can be brilliant conscious listeners .
many rooms are not so good .
let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which i think we all care about : health and education .
( hospital noises ) when i was visiting my terminally ill father in a hospital , i was asking myself , how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this ?
noise levels in hospitals have doubled in the last few years , and it affects not just the patients but also the people working there .
sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery .
this is an area i intend to take on this year .
when i see a classroom that looks like this , can you imagine how this sounds ?
`` ( `` '' do architects have ears ? '' '' ) ( laughter ) now , that 's a little unfair . some of my best friends are architects . ( laughter ) and they definitely do have ears . ''
but i think sometimes they do n't use them when they 're designing buildings . here 's a case in point .
unfortunately , it was designed like a corporate headquarters , with a vast central atrium and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all .
the children could n't hear their teachers .
it 's not just these modern buildings which suffer .
old-fashioned classrooms suffer too .
children are losing one word in two .
now that does n't mean they only get half their education , but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what 's going on .
this is affected massively by reverberation time , how reverberant a room is .
( inaudible echoing voice ) not so good , is it ?
if you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds by installing acoustic treatments , sound absorbing materials and so forth , this is what you get .
all that changed was the acoustics of the classroom in those two examples .
if education can be likened to watering a garden , which is a fair metaphor , sadly , much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers , especially for some groups , for example , those with hearing impairment .
then you have children for whom english is a second language , or whatever they 're being taught in is a second language .
and finally , after susan cain 's wonderful tedtalk in february , we know that introverts find it very difficult to relate when they 're in a noisy environment doing group work .
i have to really raise my voice to talk over 65 decibels of sound , and teachers are not just raising their voices .
noise goes up , heart rate goes up .
it may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest that many teachers are losing significant life expectancy by teaching in environments like that day after day .
what does it cost to treat a classroom down to that 0.4-second reverberation time ?
two and a half thousand pounds .
and the essex study which has just been done in the u.k. , which incidentally showed that when you do this , you do not just make a room that 's suitable for hearing-impaired children , you make a room where behavior improves , and results improve significantly , this found that sending a child out of area to a school that does have such a room , if you do n't have one , costs 90,000 pounds a year .
i 'm glad that debate is happening on this .
out of that conference , incidentally , also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they 're having to work at home , for example , in a noisy kitchen .
and that 's free out of that conference .
let 's broaden the perspective a little bit and look at cities .
i do n't know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities .
where are the office sound planners ?
so office sound is a huge area , and incidentally , noise in offices has been shown to make people less helpful , less enjoy their teamwork , and less productive at work .
finally , we have homes . we use interior designers .
where are the interior sound designers ?
`` my friend richard mazuch , an architect in london , coined the phrase `` '' invisible architecture . '' '' i love that phrase . ''
it 's about designing , not appearance , but experience , so that we have spaces that sound as good as they look , that are fit for purpose , that improve our quality of life , our health and well being , our social behavior and our productivity .
it 's time to start designing for the ears .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
so that 's a still from the video there .
so we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store .
when i go to parties , it does n't usually take very long for people to find out that i 'm a scientist and i study sex .
`` and most of the time i 'm glad to say that i can answer them , but sometimes i have to say , `` '' i 'm really sorry , but i do n't know because i 'm not that kind of a doctor . '' '' that is , i 'm not a clinician , i 'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy . ''
and my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything 's going right , rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong , like so many of you .
and now you know why i 'm fun at parties .
there 's an enormous amount of anatomical variation .
you find muscular tubes , modified legs , modified fins , as well as the mammalian fleshy , inflatable cylinder that we 're all familiar with — or at least half of you are .
( laughter ) and i think we see this tremendous variation because it 's a really effective solution to a very basic biological problem , and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with eggs and form zygotes .
now the penis is n't actually required for internal fertiliztion , but when internal fertilization evolves , penises often follow .
`` and the question i get when i start talking about this most often is , `` what made you interested in this subject ? '' ''
a lot of it did n't pan out .
but then one day i started thinking about the mammalian penis .
but before it 's brought into use during copulation it has to become rigid , it has to become difficult to bend .
and moreover , it has to work .
and i already knew that animals like this earthworm , indeed most animals , do n't support their tissues by draping them over bones .
instead they 're more like reinforced water balloons .
and a hydrostatic skeleton uses two elements .
the skeletal support comes from an interaction between a pressurized fluid and a surrounding wall of tissue that 's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins .
and the interaction is crucial .
without both elements you have no support .
if you have fluid with no wall to surround it and keep pressure up , you have a puddle .
it has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid — in this case blood — surrounded by a wall of tissue that 's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen .
because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend .
it has to be part of the explanation .
`` he was like , `` '' be careful going down this path . ''
`` i 'm not sure this project 's going to pan out . '' '' because he was afraid i was walking into a trap . ''
it had the central fluid , it had the surrounding wall , and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton .
and you can see two layers of fibers , one in blue and one in yellow , arranged in left-handed and right-handed angles .
it 's a model skeleton that i made out of a piece of cloth that i wrapped around an inflated balloon .
now my adviser 's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton .
what are you going to contribute ?
what new thing are you contributing to our knowledge of biology ?
and one thing kept bothering me , and that 's , when they 're functioning , penises do n't wiggle .
( laughter ) so something interesting had to be going on .
but instead i saw this .
there 's an outer layer and an inner layer .
the arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton .
i was really surprised at this .
everyone i showed it was really surprised at this .
why was everyone surprised at this ?
that 's because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton , and that was with fibers at zero degrees and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure .
the thing is , no one had ever seen it before in nature .
and now i was looking at one .
but the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently .
now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues .
they 're an integral part of the penile skeleton .
it 's an observation with obvious medical applications in humans as well , but it 's also relevant in a broad sense , i think , to the design of prosthetics , soft robots , basically anything where changes of shape and stiffness are important .
we 've got limits on our time .
we often focus on one disease , one model , one problem , but my experience suggests that we should take the time to apply ideas broadly between systems and just see where it takes us .
after all , if ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems , there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found .
two years ago , i was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating 100 years of islamic art in europe .
the curator had only one condition : i had to use the arabic script for my artwork .
`` and in arabic , to say `` '' no , '' '' we say `` '' no , and a thousand times no . '' '' so i decided to look for a thousand different noes . ''
now , the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation , which stood three by seven meters , in munich , germany , in september of 2010 .
nine months later i found myself spraying messages in tahrir square . the reason for this act was this image that i saw in my newsfeed .
`` so i took one `` '' no '' '' off a tombstone from the islamic museum in cairo , and i added a message to it : `` no to military rule . '' ''
so i 'll be sharing some of these noes with you .
no to burning books . the institute of egypt was burned on december 17th , a huge cultural loss .
`` no to stripping the people , and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped and beaten on the street , and the footprint reads , `` long live a peaceful revolution , '' because we will never retaliate with violence . ''
no to barrier walls . on february 5th , concrete roadblocks were set up in cairo to protect the ministry of defense from protesters .
a group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall . it 's one to one .
so i come with my stencils , and i spray them on the suit , on the tank , and on the whole wall , and this is how it stands today until further notice . ( laughter ) now , i want to leave you with a final no .
i found neruda scribbled on a piece of paper in a field hospital in tahrir , and i decided to take a no of mamluk mausoleum in cairo .
`` the message reads , [ arabic ] `` you can crush the flowers , but you ca n't delay spring . '' ''
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thank you . shukran . ( applause )
but instead of landing a job in a pharmaceutical company or a hospital , i found myself drawn to a different kind of lab , working with a different kind of patient — a patient whose illness was so serious it impacted every single person in my country ; a patient who needed to get healthy fast .
and nairobi , the major business hub , was rated 177th on the quality of living index .
it was bad .
now , an economy is only as healthy as the entities that make it up .
we all know this is a temporary solution .
or there are systems in place that would protect the private property that they create .
i would argue , only government is capable of creating these necessary conditions for economies to thrive .
new business is good for everyone .
and as you can imagine , starting or running a business in a country with an ailing government — almost impossible .
fortunately , he came to the right place .
so with our marching orders from the president himself , we embarked on the purest of the scientific method : collecting data — all the data we could get our hands on — making hypotheses , creating solutions , one after the other .
what did we find ?
well , in kenya it was taking 72 days for a business owner to register their property , compared to just one day in new zealand , which was ranked second on the world bank list .
it took 158 days to get a new electric connection .
in singapore , which is ranked first , that would only take you 26 days .
the very cells that run the show must be corrupt to the bone .
what we found was an overwhelming sense of helplessness .
they start to think the work they do does n't matter in driving change .
now imagine with me , if you had a process you had to go through — had no other alternative — and this process was inefficient , complex and very , very slow .
`` if that does n't work , maybe you 'd consider paying somebody to just `` '' unofficially '' '' take care of it on your behalf — especially if you thought nobody was going to catch you . ''
not out of malice or greed , just trying to make sure that you get something to work for you so you can move on .
unfortunately , that is the beginning of corruption .
and if left to thrive and grow , it seeps into the whole system , and before you know it , the whole body is sick .
the result ?
in just two years , kenya 's ranking moved from 136 to 92 .
we have some serious work still to do .
( laughter ) it 's that time after months of hard , grueling work at the gym , and then you get your first time to weigh yourself , and you 've lost 20 pounds .
you 're feeling unstoppable .
but think with me for just a moment .
when is the last time you accessed a government service ?
maybe applied for your driver 's license , tried to do your taxes on your own .
it 's easy in this political and global economy to want to give up when we think about transforming government .
but just because a system is sick does n't mean it 's dying .
we can not afford to give up when it comes to the challenges of fixing our governments .
in the end , what really makes a government healthy is when healthy cells — that 's you and i — get to the ground , roll up our sleeves , refuse to be helpless and believe that sometimes , all it takes is for us to create some space for healthy cells to grow and thrive .
( applause )
there 's also the drive-by haters .
why comedy ?
victory was a very weird feeling .
sometimes i get mean tweets and hate mail .
thank you .
`` i was excited to be a part of the `` '' dream '' '' theme , and then i found out i 'm leading off the `` '' nightmare ? '' '' section of it . ''
the white represents normal temperature days ; 1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen .
take a look at this storm last august .
we 're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect — one cause , one effect .
but the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can become endemic and change the range of the vectors , like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them .
this is also connected to the extinction crisis .
we have to move beyond partisanship .
it 's an enormous burden .
subprime carbon .
this year , we 're on track to beat it 68 times over .
we are seeing an explosion of new investment .
starting in 2010 , investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils .
the projections for the future are even more dramatic , even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate 40 times larger than renewables .
so , why were they not only wrong , but way wrong ?
first , the cost came down much faster than anybody expected , even as the quality went up .
there are more people without any electricity at all in india than the entire population of the united states of america .
muhammad yunus financed this one in bangladesh with micro-credit .
they will likely link up with the european union .
the united states has already been changing .
all of these coal plants have had their retirement announced .
all of them — canceled .
we are moving forward .
we are solving this crisis .
many thousands , tens of thousands , marched in cities around the world .
as i said before , we are going to win this .
i 'll finish with this story .
but eight years and two months later , in the moment that neil armstrong set foot on the moon , there was great cheer that went up in nasa 's mission control in houston .
we have everything we need .
some still doubt that we have the will to act , but i say the will to act is itself a renewable resource .
but one of the things i 've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent , or cheaper than .
and i just do n't think it 's going to work .
( applause ) and they defeated the proposal .
but it matters a lot how fast we win it .
if this turns out to be the year , that the partisan thing changes , as you said , it 's no longer a partisan issue , but you bring along people from the other side together , backed by science , backed by these kinds of investment opportunities , backed by reason that you win the day — boy , that 's really exciting .
( applause )
`` ah yes , those university days , a heady mix of ph.d-level pure mathematics and world debating championships , or , as i like to say , `` '' hello , ladies . oh yeah . '' '' did n't get much sexier than the spence at university , let me tell you . ''
it is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer from sydney , australia , to be here on the ted stage literally on the other side of the world .
and i wanted to let you know , a lot of the things you 've heard about australians are true .
from the youngest of ages , we display a prodigious sporting talent .
on the field of battle , we are brave and noble warriors .
i 'm almost five years old . fair to say , i 'm enjoying the day a lot more than santa was .
but i stand before you today not as a breakfast radio host , not as a comedian , but as someone who was , is , and always will be a mathematician .
and anyone who 's been bitten by the numbers bug knows that it bites early and it bites deep .
i was n't trying to be funny .
you can keep sitting here with us .
`` any more of that sort of talk , you 've got to go and sit over there with them . '' '' i thought about it for a nanosecond . ''
`` i took one look at the road map of life , and i ran off down the street marked `` '' geek '' '' as fast as my chubby , asthmatic little legs would carry me . ''
today we 're going to talk about prime numbers .
most of you i 'm sure remember that six is not prime because it 's 2 x 3 .
now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers .
one is not prime .
the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties .
( laughter ) another thing about primes , there is no final biggest prime number .
we know there are an infinite number of primes due to the brilliant mathematician euclid .
over thousands of years ago , he proved that for us .
but the third thing about prime numbers , mathematicians have always wondered , well at any given moment in time , what is the biggest prime that we know about ?
today we 're going to hunt for that massive prime .
all you need to know , of all the mathematics you 've ever learned , unlearned , crammed , forgotten , never understood in the first place , all you need to know is this : when i say 2 ^ 5 , i 'm talking about five little number twos next to each other all multiplied together , 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 .
so 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 .
31 is a prime number , and that five in the power is also a prime number .
and one of the things about the search for massive primes that i love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search .
this is the great swiss mathematician leonhard euler .
he was so respected , they put him on european currency back when that was a compliment .
( laughter ) euler discovered at the time the world 's biggest prime : ( 2 ^ 31 ) - 1 .
it 's over two billion .
look at it here : 39 digits long , proven to be prime in 1876 by a mathematician called lucas .
( laughter ) but one of the great things about the search for massive primes , it 's not just finding the primes .
sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting .
lucas again , in 1876 , showed us ( 2 ^ 67 ) - 1 , 21 digits long , was not prime .
we knew it was like six , but we did n't know what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together to give us that massive number .
we did n't know for almost 40 years until frank nelson cole came along .
i 'm in geek heaven . we 'll stop it there for a second .
frank nelson cole did not stop there .
he went on and on and calculated 67 powers of two .
he had found the prime factors of ( 2 ^ 67 ) - 1 .
the room went berserk — ( laughter ) — as frank nelson cole sat down , having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words .
it took focus . it took dedication .
it was the year i left university .
i was torn between mathematics and media .
it was a tough decision . i loved university .
( laughter ) but i came to a realization about my own ability .
in a roomful of maths ph.ds , i 'm as dumb as a box of hammers .
my skill is not in the mathematics .
and then curtis cooper got it back .
not years ago , not months ago , days ago .
in an amazing moment of serendipity , i had to send ted a new slide to show you what this guy had done .
`` they found another megaprime . '' '' the girls just shook their heads , put them in their hands , and let me go my own way . ''
for the slightly less geeky of you , think about the harry potter novels , okay ?
i was keen to do it , could not convince bono .
that 's the way it goes .
this number is 17 and a half thousand slides long , and we know it is prime as confidently as we know the number seven is prime .
( laughter ) i know what you 're thinking : adam , we 're happy that you 're happy , but why should we care ?
let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful .
it 's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
my laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large numbers .
the discovery of that prime is similar to the work people are doing in unraveling rna sequences , in searching through data from seti and other astronomical projects .
here 's a machine doing something cool .
this is the cubestormer ii .
using the power of the smartphone , it can examine the cube and solve the cube in five seconds .
( applause ) that scares some people . that excites me .
how lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together ?
people were expecting me to talk about my beloved sydney swans football team .
in our beautiful , indigenous sport of australian football , they won the equivalent of the super bowl .
people thought it might have been an interview i 'd done on my show .
it might have been a book i read , the arts . no , no , no .
( applause ) and what was so gorgeous about this discovery was 50 years ago peter higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions : how is it that the things that make us up have no mass ?
i 've clearly got mass . where does it come from ?
and he postulated a suggestion that there 's this infinite , incredibly small field stretching throughout the universe , and as other particles go through those particles and interact , that 's where they get their mass .
`` the rest of the scientific community said , `` '' great idea , higgsy . ''
we thought it might be there , and we went and found it .
that is the essence of being human .
that is what we are all about .
or as my friend descartes might put it , we think , therefore we are .
thank you .
( applause )
even if i did little , sales would be ok .
mostly they 're worried about each other .
either way they were going to eat it .
essentially , for three reasons : calculation , application , and last , and unfortunately least in terms of the time we give it , inspiration .
`` mathematics is the science of patterns , and we study it to learn how to think logically , critically and creatively , but too much of the mathematics that we learn in school is not effectively motivated , and when our students ask , `` why are we learning this ? '' ''
but would n't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind ?
now , i know many people have not had the opportunity to see how this can happen , so let me give you a quick example with my favorite collection of numbers , the fibonacci numbers . ( applause ) yeah ! i already have fibonacci fans here .
that 's great .
from the standpoint of calculation , they 're as easy to understand as one plus one , which is two .
`` indeed , the person we call fibonacci was actually named leonardo of pisa , and these numbers appear in his book `` '' liber abaci , '' '' which taught the western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today . ''
the number of petals on a flower is typically a fibonacci number , or the number of spirals on a sunflower or a pineapple tends to be a fibonacci number as well .
so one squared is one , two squared is four , three squared is nine , five squared is 25 , and so on .
but you would n't expect anything special to happen when you add the squares together .
but check this out .
and four plus nine is 13 , nine plus 25 is 34 , and yes , the pattern continues .
suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few fibonacci numbers .
add 25 , we get 40 .
add 64 , we get 104 .
those are not fibonacci numbers , but if you look at them closely , you 'll see the fibonacci numbers buried inside of them .
do you see it ? i 'll show it to you .
six is two times three , 15 is three times five , 40 is five times eight , two , three , five , eight , who do we appreciate ?
why should the squares of one , one , two , three , five and eight add up to eight times 13 ?
i 'll show you by drawing a simple picture .
we 'll start with a one-by-one square and next to that put another one-by-one square .
together , they form a one-by-two rectangle .
now let me ask you a simple question : what is the area of the rectangle ?
just as we created it .
it 's one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared . right ?
that 's the area .
so the area is also eight times 13 .
now , if we continue this process , we 'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21 , 21 by 34 , and so on .
now , i show all this to you because , like so much of mathematics , there 's a beautiful side to it that i fear does not get enough attention in our schools .
we spend lots of time learning about calculation , but let 's not forget about application , including , perhaps , the most important application of all , learning how to think .
if i could summarize this in one sentence , it would be this : mathematics is not just solving for x , it 's also figuring out why .
( applause )
it looks like this .
everybody 's icon , but also the default position of a curator of italian renaissance paintings , which i was then .
`` or then there 's this , or rather these : the two versions of leonardo 's `` '' virgin of the rocks '' '' that were about to come together in london for the very first time . ''
i was literally up to my eyes in leonardo , and i had been for three years .
so , he was occupying every part of my brain .
leonardo had taught me , during that three years , about what a picture can do .
about taking you from your own material world into a spiritual world .
he said , actually , that he believed the job of the painter was to paint everything that was visible and invisible in the universe .
he shows us , i think , the human soul .
he shows us the capacity of ourselves to move into a spiritual realm .
to see a vision of the universe that 's more perfect than our own .
to see god 's own plan , in some sense .
in the end , i accepted the job without actually having been here .
again , i 'd been there a couple of years before , but on that particular visit .
so , it was just before the time that the leonardo show was due to open when i finally made it back to the met , to new york , to see my new domain .
fifty-seven of these galleries — like 57 varieties of baked beans , i believe .
this object felt utterly and completely alien .
and then it was made worse — there were two of them .
what was the anatomy of my distaste ?
you know , so nouveau riche , frankly .
it 's such an extraordinarily artificial color .
where all the little girls would come either as a princess or a fairy .
there was one who would come as a fairy princess .
i realized this was an elephant that had absolutely nothing to do with a majestic march across the serengeti .
it was a dumbo nightmare . ( laughter ) but something more profound was happening as well .
the label had told me that these pieces were made by the sèvres manufactory , made of porcelain in the late 1750s , and designed by a designer called jean-claude duplessis , actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as i later learned .
there was a sort of idea really , that , if you owned a vase like this , then there was really only one fate possible .
( laughter ) so , there i was — in a sort of paroxysm of horror .
but i took the job and i went on looking at these vases .
i sort of had to because they 're on a through route in the met .
so , almost anywhere i went , there they were .
they had this kind of odd sort of fascination , like a car accident .
where i could n't stop looking .
and as i did so , i started thinking : well , what are we actually looking at here ?
it has these kinds of sculptural ingredients .
and then the play between — actually really quite carefully disposed color and gilding , and the sculptural surface , is really rather remarkable .
and then remember , not just one , but two .
so what you would have had were candles on either side .
imagine that effect of candlelight on that surface .
on the slightly uneven pink , on the beautiful gold .
this is an object of the imagination .
if you think about the mad 18th-century operas of the time — set in the orient .
this is an object which is all about escapism .
it 's not an escapism that we feel particularly happy with today , however .
it 's a triumph , in a way , of bourgeois values rather than aristocratic ones .
then , i think we 've started doing the same .
we 've allowed ourselves to lead our fantasy lives in front of screens .
i think it 's beginning to happen .
in london , for example , with these extraordinary buildings that have been appearing over the last few years .
it 's actually amazing to look out of a high building nowadays there .
but even then , there 's a resistance .
i feel lucky in a way , i 've encountered this object .
and unlike the pink elephant vase , this was a kind of love at first sight .
in fact , reader , i married him . i bought him .
he 's a staffordshire figure made in the middle of the 19th century .
so i loved , on an art historical level , i loved that layered quality that he has .
i love his orange and pink breeches .
i love the fact that he seems to be going off to war , having just finished the washing up . ( laughter ) he seems also to have forgotten his sword .
in a way , he 's become my sort of alter ego .
he 's , i hope , a little bit dignified , but mostly rather vulgar . ( laughter ) and energetic , i hope , too .
thank you very much .
and so it was just an incredibly powerful experience .
my history is irish .
it was a great idea , and pretty much a complete failure .
and you can do it in nearly any species .
this is where it gets clever .
in other words , what if crispr also copied and pasted itself .
and on this axis , i 'm showing dollars per person in income .
first , we have the fast rise in uganda and zimbabwe .
india has many because they are many .
and after a major injury of your central nervous system , the patients often remain with a severe handicap .
and that 's probably the reason why i 've chosen to be a functional neurosurgeon .
what is a functional neurosurgeon ?
you have to imagine that when a patient comes in with a severe head trauma , his brain is swelling and he 's increasing his intracranial pressure .
and in order to save his life , you have to decrease this intracranial pressure .
what do i mean by that ?
and after many attempts , jean-françois did it .
and that was , for us , a major surprise .
why ?
because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture , with large green cells surrounding small , immature cells .
and you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells , able to turn into any type of cell of the body .
they divide slowly , and after a few weeks of culture , they even died .
and it took us a long time to understand where they came from .
these blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells .
they have a very important role during the development stage .
so in the first-case scenario , we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks , as if they were taken from the brain , they go back home , the space is already busy , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
so for that , we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task .
they had to retrieve food pellets from a tray .
so on the left side , you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered .
he 's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion .
and look now when we re-implant the cells : two months after re-implantation , the same individual .
and of course the question is , what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials ?
bg : which is understandable , the brain is delicate , etc .
and then , you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients .
and then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial .
bg : jocelyne , thank you for coming to ted and sharing this .
bg : thank you .
so i 'd like you to imagine for a moment that you 're a soldier in the heat of battle .
maybe you 're a roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe you 're a zulu warrior .
but above all , the scout wants to know what 's really there , as accurately as possible .
but dreyfus was the only jewish officer at that rank in the army , and unfortunately at this time , the french army was highly anti-semitic .
this just convinced them more that dreyfus was not only guilty , but sneaky as well , because clearly he had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it .
i mean , you might even assume that they were setting him up , that they were intentionally framing him .
but historians do n't think that 's what happened .
which makes you wonder : what does it say about the human mind that we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man ?
we want them to win . we want to defend them .
and other information or ideas are the enemy , and we want to shoot them down .
that 's a good call , let 's not examine it too closely .
or , maybe you 've read an article or a study that examined some controversial policy , like capital punishment .
this shapes how we think about our health , our relationships , how we decide how to vote , what we consider fair or ethical .
however , fortunately for dreyfus , his story is not over .
this is colonel picquart .
also like most people in the army , he was at least casually anti-semitic .
but personally , for me , the fact that picquart was anti-semitic actually makes his actions more admirable , because he had the same prejudices , the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers , but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it trumped all of that .
this mindset is what i 'm personally passionate about .
it 's just rooted in different emotions .
for example , scouts are curious .
they 're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations .
scouts also have different values .
but what we most need to use those principles well is scout mindset .
do you yearn to defend your own beliefs ?
nasa uses this extreme environment to train astronauts and aquanauts , and last year , they invited us along for the ride .
all the footage was taken from our open rov , which is a robot that we built in our garage .
it 's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and costs about 1,000 times cheaper than the rovs james cameron used to explore the titanic .
scientists use rovs to explore the oceans .
so a few years ago , my friend eric and i decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the sierras .
we had heard this story about lost gold from a gold rush-era robbery , and we wanted to go up there .
unfortunately , we did n't have any money and we did n't have any tools to do it .
so eric had an initial design idea for a robot , but we did n't have all the parts figured out , so we did what anybody would do in our situation : we asked the internet for help .
more specifically , we created this website , openrov.com , and shared our intentions and our plans for the first few months , it was just eric and i talking back to each other on the forums , but pretty soon , we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists , and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do .
so about that time , our little expedition became quite a story , and it got picked up in the new york times .
and we were pretty much just overwhelmed with interest from people who wanted a kit that they could build this open rov themselves .
so we decided to put the project on kickstarter , and when we did , we raised our funding goal in about two hours , and all of a sudden , had this money to make these kits .
but we were able to do it , we got all the kits made , thanks a lot to techshop , which was a big help to us , and we shipped these kits all over the world just before christmas of last year , so it was just a few months ago .
but we 're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world , including this shot from under the ice in antarctica .
( laughter ) so we 're still publishing all the designs online , encouraging anyone to build these themselves .
that 's the only way that we could have done this .
but the actual robot is really only half the story .
the real potential , the long term potential , is with this community of diy ocean explorers that are forming all over the globe .
what can we discover when there 's thousands of these devices roaming the seas ?
did you find the gold ?
it was the glimpse into a potential future for ocean exploration .
it 's something that 's not limited to the james camerons of the world , but something that we 're all participating in .
it 's an underwater world we 're all exploring together .
it was a remarkable tale , but faiza saved the best for last .
`` `` '' you know , i am a virgin , '' '' she told me . ''
this is the modern middle east , where two millennia after the coming of christ , virgin births are still a fact of life .
faiza 's story is just one of hundreds i 've heard over the years , traveling across the arab region talking to people about sex .
but i grew up in canada , far from my arab roots .
that i chose to look at sex comes from my background in hiv/aids , as a writer and a researcher and an activist .
now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society , because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage : in politics and economics , in religion and tradition , in gender and generations .
but running across it are three red lines — these are topics you are not supposed to challenge in word or deed .
the first of these is politics .
now while those in power , old and new , continue to cling to business as usual , millions are still pushing back , and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life .
that second red line is religion .
but now religion and politics are connected , with the rise of such groups as the muslim brotherhood .
and some people , at least , are starting to ask questions about the role of islam in public and private life .
audience : sex .
shereen el feki : louder , i ca n't hear you .
sef : again , please do n't be shy .
audience : sex .
sef : absolutely , that 's right , it 's sex . ( laughter ) across the arab region , the only accepted context for sex is marriage — approved by your parents , sanctioned by religion and registered by the state .
marriage is your ticket to adulthood .
it 's a social citadel ; it 's an impregnable fortress which resists any assault , any alternative .
and around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex , against condoms , against abortion , against homosexuality , you name it .
her virginity statement was not a piece of wishful thinking .
men have sex before marriage , and people more or less turn a blind eye .
but faiza did n't actually realize this , because there 's so little sexuality education in schools , and so little communication in the family .
this is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the arab region .
and so when faiza eventually fetched up at a hospital in casablanca , the man who offered to help her , instead tried to rape her .
sadly , faiza is not alone .
in egypt , where my research is focused , i have seen plenty of trouble in and out of the citadel .
they are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life , but they ca n't find jobs .
this is one of the major drivers of the recent uprisings , and it is one of the reasons for the rising age of marriage in much of the arab region .
`` there are career women who want to get married , but ca n't find a husband , because they defy gender expectations , or as one young female doctor in tunisia put it to me , `` '' the women , they are becoming more and more open . ''
`` but the man , he is still at the prehistoric stage . '' '' and then there are men and women who cross the heterosexual line , who have sex with their own sex , or who have a different gender identity . ''
couples who are looking for greater happiness , greater sexual happiness in their married lives , but are at a loss of how to achieve it , especially wives , who are afraid of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom .
yeah . it 's not as if the arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups .
double standards for men and women , sex as a source of shame , family control limiting individual choices , and a vast gulf between appearance and reality : what people are doing and what they 're willing to admit to , and a general reluctance to move beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion .
football , everybody talks about it , but hardly anyone plays .
`` but sex , everybody is doing it , but nobody wants to talk about it . '' '' ( laughter ) ( music ) ( in arabic ) sef : i want to give you a piece of advice , which if you follow it , will make you happy in life . ''
when your husband reaches out to you , when he seizes a part of your body , sigh deeply and look at him lustily .
the encyclopedia is just one in a long line of arabic erotica , much of it written by religious scholars .
a thousand years ago , we used to have whole dictionaries of sex in arabic .
in egypt and many of its neighbors , this closing down is part of a wider closing in political , social and cultural thought .
and it is the product of a complex historical process , one which has gained ground with the rise of islamic conservatism since the late 1970s .
`` `` '' just say no '' '' is what conservatives around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo . ''
in the arab region , they brand these attempts as a western conspiracy to undermine traditional arab and islamic values .
but history shows us that even as recently as our fathers ' and grandfathers ' day , there have been times of greater pragmatism , and tolerance , and a willingness to consider other interpretations : be it abortion , or masturbation , or even the incendiary topic of homosexuality .
it is not black and white , as conservatives would have us believe .
( laughter ) over my travels , i 've met men and women across the arab region who 've been exploring that spectrum — sexologists who are trying to help couples find greater happiness in their marriages , innovators who are managing to get sexuality education into schools , small groups of men and women , lesbian , gay , transgendered , transsexual , who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real-world support .
groups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against hiv and other occupational hazards , and ngos that are helping unwed mothers like faiza find a place in society , and critically , stay with their kids .
now these efforts are small , they 're often underfunded , and they face formidable opposition .
social change does n't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation , beating or indeed baring of breasts , but rather through negotiation .
but it begins with a journey that i myself have made , asking hard questions of received wisdoms in sexual life .
now given the turmoil in many countries in the arab region , talking about sex , challenging the taboos , seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury .
but at this critical moment in history , if we do not anchor freedom and justice , dignity and equality , privacy and autonomy in our personal lives , in our sexual lives , we will find it very hard to achieve in public life .
no matter where we live and love .
it is peaceful and violent .
how do we glue those grains of sand together ?
what are the dates again ?

and studies have shown that art impacts our emotions more effectively than a scary news report .
experts predict ice-free arctic summers as early as 2020 .
i have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections with an accessible medium , one that moves us in a way that statistics may not .
i consider my work drawings but others call them painting .
in august of 2012 , i led my first expedition , taking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of greenland .
my mother was originally supposed to lead this trip .
she and i were in the early stages of planning , as we had intended to go together , when she fell victim to a brain tumor .
the cancer quickly took over her body and mind , and she passed away six months later .
yet , while the grandeur of the ice is evident , so , too , is its vulnerability .
while i was there , i collected images and inspiration for a new body of work : drawings of waves lapping on the coast of a nation that could be entirely underwater within this century .
among the many gifts my mother gave me was the ability to focus on the positive , rather than the negative .
my drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose .
our existence has been co-opted , silenced and erased .
mom was a nurse 's aid .
it 's about disillusionment .
and it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot .
and with my albanian friends , we tried to stop it , but we failed .
we all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think .
we are all intimately connected .
it used to be that if you wanted to get a computer to do something new , you would have to program it .
so this was the challenge faced by this man , arthur samuel .
how can you write a program , lay out in excruciating detail , how to be better than you at checkers ?
and indeed it worked , and in fact , by 1962 , this computer had beaten the connecticut state champion .
i was the president of kaggle , a community of over 200,000 machine learning practictioners .
so from this vantage point , i was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past , can do today , and what it could do in the future .
perhaps the first big success of machine learning commercially was google .
google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm , and this algorithm is based on machine learning .
since that time , there have been many commercial successes of machine learning .
companies like amazon and netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy , movies that you might like to watch .
these are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand .
`` this is also how ibm was successful in getting watson to beat the two world champions at `` '' jeopardy , '' '' answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one . ''
if you want to be able to tell the difference between , say , a tree and a pedestrian , well , that 's pretty important .
so we now know that computers can learn , and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes do n't know how to do ourselves , or maybe can do them better than us .
they used an extraordinary algorithm called deep learning .
deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works , and as a result it 's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do .
( video ) richard rashid : now , the last step that i want to be able to take in this process is to actually speak to you in chinese .
jeremy howard : well , that was at a machine learning conference in china .
( applause ) thank you .
this is much like the way that humans learn .
for example , google announced last year that they had mapped every single location in france in two hours , and the way they did it was that they fed street view images into a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers .
the similar images actually have similar backgrounds , similar directions of the faces , even some with their tongue out .
all i uploaded was an image .
well , it 's not just that computers can see .
deep learning now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things .
this algorithm developed out of switzerland by people , none of whom speak or understand any chinese .
as i say , using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this , even compared to native human understanding .
this is very different from actually understanding the images .
perhaps not surprising now that i 'm going to tell you they can write .
here is some text that i generated using a deep learning algorithm yesterday .
each of these sentences was generated by a deep learning algorithm to describe each of those pictures .
so we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities .
similarly , here , this neuron segmentation .
so myself , as somebody with no previous background in medicine , i seem to be entirely well qualified to start a new medical company , which i did .
i want to give you an example .
so the nice thing is that the human and the computer can now work together .
and when it does so successfully , the human who is driving it can then point out the areas that are interesting .
so as we go through this process , we 're gradually telling the computer more and more about the kinds of structures we 're looking for .
the fronts and the backs of the cars are all mixed up .
in this case , even after we let the computer try to rotate this for a while , we still find that the left sides and the right sides pictures are all mixed up together .
it 's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects that 's separated out these together .
and using this kind of process for each of the different groups , we are now up to an 80 percent success rate in classifying the 1.5 million images .
so imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches ?
what are services ?
these are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do .
what does that mean ?
so if you think , oh , it 's all happened before , we 've seen the results in the past of when new things come along and they get replaced by new jobs , what are these new jobs going to be ?
it 's very hard for us to estimate this , because human performance grows at this gradual rate , but we now have a system , deep learning , that we know actually grows in capability exponentially .
but in five years ' time , computers will be off this chart .
in the industrial revolution , we saw a step change in capability thanks to engines .
the thing is , though , that after a while , things flattened out .
so i want us to start having this discussion now .
i wondered if this was an inevitable outcome , or could we do something about it .
it was just an idea .
but i went to work at an architecture firm , and eventually talked to my coworkers about it , and they loved the idea .
i was doing two and three meetings a week for two and a half years , and so was cathy and her staff and a handful of volunteers .
but there we were , and it was kind of weird , but it was really , really powerful .
from the beginning , our coalition was diverse .
people on the lower end of the economic spectrum loved it , too .
that 's what people in atlanta do .
we did n't call it sprawl at that time .
but when we look today in wonder and disgust , maybe , at the metropolis sprawl before us , we wonder if we 're stuck .
are these the inevitable and permanent outcomes ?
and if they are , ca n't we change them ?
we 're taking places like this and transforming them into this .
and this is all exciting and good .
good for us !
this is urgent .
the answer ca n't be to not build parks and transit and grocery stores .
we ca n't call it a success without them .
they 're my friends and neighbors .
we are the lives we 're talking about .
these places are n't inevitable .
( applause )
everyone is both a learner and a teacher .
now the students and i enjoyed the class , but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern , the teaching technology is n't .
in fact , i use basically the same technology as this 14th-century classroom .
note the textbook , the sage on the stage , and the sleeping guy in the back . ( laughter ) just like today .
so my co-teacher , sebastian thrun , and i thought , there must be a better way .
and that grew to 160,000 students from 209 countries .
we were thrilled to have that kind of audience , and just a bit terrified that we had n't finished preparing the class yet . ( laughter ) so we got to work .
we studied what others had done , what we could copy and what we could change .
benjamin bloom had showed that one-on-one tutoring works best , so that 's what we tried to emulate , like with me and my mom , even though we knew it would be one-on-thousands .
here , an overhead video camera is recording me as i 'm talking and drawing on a piece of paper .
now , from khan academy , we saw that short 10-minute videos worked much better than trying to record an hour-long lecture and put it on the small-format screen .
our typical video is two minutes , sometimes shorter , never more than six , and then we pause for a quiz question , to make it feel like one-on-one tutoring .
students learn best when they 're actively practicing .
`` one student wrote , `` '' now i 'm seeing bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere i look . '' '' and i like that kind of response . ''
that 's just what we were going for .
we did n't want students to memorize the formulas ; we wanted to change the way they looked at the world .
and we succeeded .
and it 's a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education , and in doing so , we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes .
most online classes , the videos are always available .
but if you can do it any time , that means you can do it tomorrow , and if you can do it tomorrow , well , you may not ever get around to it . ( laughter ) so we brought back the innovation of having due dates . ( laughter ) you could watch the videos any time you wanted during the week , but at the end of the week , you had to get the homework done .
this motivated the students to keep going , and it also meant that everybody was working on the same thing at the same time , so if you went into a discussion forum , you could get an answer from a peer within minutes .
now , i 'll show you some of the forums , most of which were self-organized by the students themselves .
`` from daphne koller and andrew ng , we learned the concept of `` '' flipping '' '' the classroom . ''
students watched the videos on their own , and then they come together to discuss them .
from eric mazur , i learned about peer instruction , that peers can be the best teachers , because they 're the ones that remember what it 's like to not understand .
sebastian and i have forgotten some of that .
of course , we could n't have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students , so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums .
it was crucial that the students see that we 're working hard for them and they 're all supporting each other .
they got this statement of accomplishment .
so what have we learned ?
sebastian 's teaching another class now .
it 's a really exciting time .
we 're gathering thousands of interactions per student per class , billions of interactions altogether , and now we can start analyzing that , and when we learn from that , do experimentations , that 's when the real revolution will come .
and you 'll be able to see the results from a new generation of amazing students .
( applause )
up until now , our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms .
communication between people , on the other hand , is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed .
we observe facial expressions , body language , and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another .
our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human-computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do , but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences .
and what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain , our center for control and experience .
when these neurons interact , the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse , which can be measured .
the majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain , and to increase the area that 's available for mental capacity , the brain surface is highly folded .
now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses .
each individual 's cortex is folded differently , very much like a fingerprint .
so even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain , by the time the structure has been folded , its physical location is very different between individuals , even identical twins .
the second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .
now this is quite time consuming and is n't the most comfortable process .
( applause ) so the device that you see is a 14-channel , high-fidelity eeg acquisition system .
it does n't require any scalp preparation , no conductive gel or paste .
it only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle .
and compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional eeg system , this headset only costs a few hundred dollars .
now on to the detection algorithms .
so the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal .
he just hangs out . he 's relaxed .
and the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain , because every brain is different .
`` evan grant : let 's do `` '' pull . '' '' tan le : okay , so let 's choose `` '' pull . '' '' so the idea here now is that evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen , and there 's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he 's doing that . ''
so let 's see if evan can actually try and imagine pulling .
ah , good job !
so we have a little bit of time available , so i 'm going to ask evan to do a really difficult task .
( laughter ) tl : but we can see that it actually works , even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time .
good job . good job .
so , as you can see , before , there is a leveling system built into this software so that as evan , or any user , becomes more familiar with the system , they can continue to add more and more detections , so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character .
obviously , you can experience the fantasy of magic and control the world with your mind .
and also , colors , lighting , sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you 're having , in real time .
`` and moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world , with robots and simple machines , for example — in this case , flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking `` '' lift '' '' with your mind . ''
the technology can also be applied to real world applications — in this example , a smart home .
and of course , also to the lighting — turning them on or off .
and finally , to real life-changing applications , such as being able to control an electric wheelchair .
in this example , facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands .
now smile to go straight .
tl : we really — thank you .
i got up this morning at 6:10 a.m .
i was awakened once during the night .
my heart rate was 61 beats per minute — my blood pressure , 127 over 74 .
i had zero minutes of exercise yesterday , so my maximum heart rate during exercise was n't calculated .
i had about 600 milligrams of caffeine , zero of alcohol .
and my score on the narcissism personality index , or the npi-16 , is a reassuring 0.31 .
people were tracking their food via twitter , their kids ' diapers on their iphone .
they were making detailed journals of their spending , their mood , their symptoms , their treatments .
they 're now down to well under a dollar a piece , and they 're going into all kinds of devices .
but what 's interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this .
this kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device — among early adopters at the moment — the fitbit .
i just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor .
and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
this is the strap that people use to transmit heart-rate data to their nike+ system .
the rest of it is the bedside console ; just for reference , this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago — i mean , really until now .
this just was presented at a health care conference in d.c .
now , we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world — these tiny sensors that gather data in nature , the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used , and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute .
here 's a biometric device : a pair of apple earbuds .
last year , apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation , heart rate and body temperature via the earbuds .
what should it be for ?
some people will say it 's for public health research .
some people will say it 's for avant-garde marketing research .
i 'd like to tell you that it 's also for self-knowledge .
so , if we want to act more effectively in the world , we have to get to know ourselves better .
february .
april .
let me tell you a story .
but i 'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything .
this happens one day : i 'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology : viruses and how they attack .
`` finally , my favorite student , she looks me straight in the eye , and she says , `` '' the reading sucked . '' '' and then she clarified . she said , `` '' you know what , i do n't mean that it sucks . it means that i did n't understand a word of it . ''
i 'm totally clueless .
i have no idea what to do next .
`` so the only thing i can think of is say , `` '' listen . let me tell you a story . ''
the main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses .
these guys are blown up a couple million times .
`` but what a lot of people do n't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick . '' '' now , the story that i start telling my kids , it starts out like a horror story . ''
once upon a time there 's this happy little bacterium .
do n't get too attached to him .
maybe he 's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere , and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good .
maybe he ate something bad for lunch , and then things get really horrible , as his skin rips apart , and he sees a virus coming out from his insides .
a virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its dna into it .
the next thing is , that virus dna made stuff that chopped up the bacteria dna .
and now that we 've gotten rid of the bacteria dna , the virus dna takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses .
the workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they 're following different instructions .
when a secret agent virus infects a bacterium , they do a little espionage .
here , this cloaked , secret agent virus is slipping his dna into the bacterial cell , but here 's the kicker : it does n't do anything harmful — not at first .
they 're just happily living together until a signal happens and — bam ! — all of the dna pops out .
it takes control of these cells , turns them into virus-making factories , and they all burst , a huge , extended bacteria family , all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts , the viruses taking over the bacterium .
so now you understand how viruses can attack cells .
there are two ways : on the left is what we call the lytic way , where the viruses go right in and take over the cells .
but if you 've graduated from high school , i can almost guarantee you 've seen this information before .
so when my students were first learning this , why did they hate it so much ?
well , there were a couple of reasons .
you know , in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness .
`` i used to work for an educational publisher , and as a writer , i was always told never to use stories or fun , engaging language , because then my work might not be viewed as `` '' serious '' '' and `` '' scientific . '' '' right ? i mean , because god forbid somebody have fun when they 're learning science . ''
so we have this field of science that 's all about slime , and color changes . check this out .
and then we have , of course , as any good scientist has to have , explosions !
but if a textbook seems too much fun , it 's somehow unscientific .
now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible .
`` if we want to summarize that story that i told you earlier , we could start by saying something like , `` '' these viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their dna into a bacterium . '' '' the way this showed up in the textbook , it looked like this : `` '' bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium . '' '' that 's great , perfect for 13-year-olds . ''
but here 's the thing . there are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there 's no way that we could ever give that to students , because it contains some language that is n't completely accurate .
`` so a professional science writer would circle that and say , `` '' that has to go . ''
`` we have to change it to something much more technical . '' '' and after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation , they 'd find fault with almost every word i 've used , and they 'd have to change anything that was n't serious enough , and they 'd have to change everything that was n't 100 percent perfect . ''
then it would be accurate , but it would be completely impossible to understand .
`` it 's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know , who gives us all the details nobody cares about , where you 're like , `` '' oh , i met my friend for lunch the other day , and she was wearing these ugly jeans . ''
`` i mean , they were n't really jeans , they were more kind of , like , leggings , but , like , i guess they 're actually kind of more like jeggings , like , but i think — `` '' and you 're just like , `` '' oh my god . ''
`` i 'm just trying to tell a story . '' '' because good storytelling is all about emotional connection . ''
but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across .
i think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education .
now , finally , i am often so disappointed when people think that i 'm advocating a dumbing down of science .
i 'm currently a ph.d. student at mit , and i absolutely understand the importance of detailed , specific scientific communication between experts , but not when we 're trying to teach 13-year-olds .
if a young learner thinks that all viruses have dna , that 's not going to ruin their chances of success in science .
there 's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple , understandable ways .
and i myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that i put on youtube .
the feedback that i get is sometimes misspelled and it 's often written in lolcats , but nonetheless it 's so appreciative , so thankful that i know this is the right way we should be communicating science .
there 's still so much work left to be done , though , and if you 're involved with science in any way i urge you to join me .
how should you start ?
( applause )
( laughter ) and i 'm an academic , so i put audiences to sleep for free . ( laughter )
but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children 's hospital up at stanford in palo alto .
and it 's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning , that pain is a disease .
but about 10 percent of the time , after the patient has recovered from one of those events , pain persists .
and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it , i want to show you how it feels for my patients .
now , i want you to imagine that i 'm stroking it with this .
( laughter ) a very different feeling .
imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather , but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling — and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain .
in fact , imagine something even worse .
imagine i were to stroke your child 's arm with this feather , and their brain [ was ] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch .
as you can see , she 's a beautiful , young woman .
she was 16 years old last year when i met her , and she aspired to be a professional dancer .
and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals , she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist .
now you would probably imagine , as she did , that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person 's life .
wrap it in an ace bandage , take some ibuprofen for a week or two , and that 's the end of the story .
but in chandler 's case , that was the beginning of the story .
but the worst part was , not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
the worst part was that she had allodynia , the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch .
misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame ?
well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house .
in your house , wires run in the wall , from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb .
and when you turn the switch on , the light goes on .
these cells , called glial cells , were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together , like the nerves .
it 's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch , the toilet flushed three doors down , or your dishwasher went on , or your computer monitor turned off .
the nervous system has plasticity .
well , what do we do about that ?
what can we do in a case like chandler 's ?
we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time .
and most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life .
and we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency , despair and depression that always accompanies severe , chronic pain .
`` so i have hope that in the future , the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized , who said , `` '' my philosophy : no pain , no pain . '' '' thank you very much . ''
so i work in marketing , which i love , but my first passion was physics , a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when i had a little less gray hair .
so he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us .
so quick show of hands — who studied some marketing in university ?
okay , lots of you .
so , hopefully this will bring back some happy , or possibly some slightly disturbing memories .
so , physics and marketing .
this is something that perhaps turkish airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign .
it 's the same with brands : the more massive a brand , the more baggage it has , the more force is needed to change its positioning .
now , who remembers heisenberg 's uncertainty principle ?
so this says that it 's impossible , by definition , to measure exactly the state — i.e. , the position — and the momentum of a particle , because the act of measuring it , by definition , changes it .
by measuring it , the act of measurement changes it .
the act of observation changes it .
it 's the same in marketing .
think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group , and almost none of them buy lots of junk food .
and yet , mcdonald 's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year .
think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets , who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit , but do n't shop like that any other day .
so luckily , the science — no , sorry — the marketing is getting easier .
luckily , with now better point-of-sale tracking , more digital media consumption , you can measure more what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they do .
what this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning , and it will strengthen it , but it will not conclusively prove it .
and only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water .
it only took one robust observation from copernicus to blow that idea out of the water .
and there are parallels for marketing — you can invest for a long time in a brand , but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers ' belief .
take bp — they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand , but then one little accident .
and tiger woods , for a long time , the perfect brand ambassador .
( laughter ) so the physics is that you can not prove a hypothesis , but it 's easy to disprove it — any hypothesis is shaky .
and lastly , to the slightly obscure world of entropy — the second law of thermodynamics .
the same is true of marketing .
if we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand .
but where we are today , things have changed .
with the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer , it 's impossible to control where it goes .
i actually saw him speak — he did a good job .
it makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force , which is ultimately good for your brand .
the message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed .
you ca n't fight it , so embrace it and find a way to work with it .
thank you .
( applause )
there 's a great big elephant in the room called the economy .
it turns out that b of a in september had 32 times .
everything else is mandated .
that 's the financial crisis .
they started competing .
you re-grow a set of teeth .
i mean , you understand where this story 's going .
i 'm driven by pure passion to create photographs that tell stories .
i can take you to paris for a view from the tournelle bridge .
i am a relentless collector of magical moments .
and as i pan my camera to the right , i noticed there was a mirror on the wall and i saw they were actually reflecting in it .
one of the things that 's great is i love to people-watch .
einstein described time as a fabric .
think of the surface of a trampoline : it warps and stretches with gravity .
i see time as a fabric as well , except i take that fabric and flatten it , compress it into single plane .
i am exploring the space-time continuum within a two-dimensional still photograph .
now when i do these pictures , it 's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind .
this can take us several months to complete .
the fun thing about this work is i have absolutely zero control when i get up there on any given day and capture photographs .
infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there .
new york city 's not exceptional .
our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change .
we just need courage .
the health of our patients , the health of us all , depends on it .
( applause )
so how do you know if your breasts are dense ?
mbi found 83 percent .
first , know your density .
i 'm ellen , and i 'm totally obsessed with food .
`` and she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the `` '' feed bag '' '' — which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the feed bag . ''
so that was kind of my first dream , was to start this company called feed , and here 's a screenshot of our website .
i think about eating a lot , and i really love it .
unfortunately , what is farmed ends up as what we eat .
here 's where it happens .
this is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player .
`` now he , the guy , takes all of this in , figuring , `` honestly , geez , what are my chances ? '' ''
but he comes up with that , you know .
add some water .
seven different salts .
he means he 's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land , but just panhandle at the ocean .
at least , that 's how it seems .
right now , talking to you , i 'm not even really a guy .
but i 'm still suggesting you and i should meet .
hell , ponytail alone .
i got a pencil you can borrow .
`` she just says , `` '' no thank you . '' '' you know ? ''
`` `` '' there 's no such thing as space men , '' '' she said . ''
close encounter two : brookline , massachusetts , 1984 .
as i walked out , her pace slowed .
here 's a question that matters .
loved to fight , lost his arm in one of these battles .
no problem , he just made a suit of armor , put it on , perfect prosthetic .
and of course these prosthetics have been getting more and more useful , more and more modern .
or hugh will say what type of cliff do i want to climb ?
they 've become artificial hips .
and then they 've evolved further to become not just nice to have but essential to have .
they get integrated into the muscle .
so how quickly you react to something depends on the diameter of a nerve .
those are the order of magnitude of changes you 're talking about .
this is a fourth sort of level of prosthetics .
so this functions as your hearing aid and also as your phone .
and for that we turn to a great philosopher who was a very smart man despite being a yankee fan .
and one of the things that we 've been doing is trying to figure out how to reprogram cells .
and once you can insert an entire human genome into a cell , then you begin to ask the question , would you want to enhance any of that genome ?
do you want to enhance a human body ?
how would you want to enhance a human body ?
and all of a sudden , it 's not just one little bit , it 's all these stacked little bits that allow you to take little portions of it until all the portions coming together lead you to something that 's very different .
and a lot of people are very scared by this stuff .
the answer lies in part with lord rees , astronomer royal of great britain .
and one of his favorite sayings is the universe is 100 percent malevolent .
and by the way , that 's happened five times on earth , and therefore it is very likely that the human species on earth is going to go extinct someday .
and it becomes a moral imperative because it 's going to be really hard to live on mars if we do n't fundamentally modify the human body .
you go from one cell , mom and dad coming together to make one cell , in a cascade to 10 trillion cells .
we do n't know , if you change the gravity substantially , if the same thing will happen to create your body .
so life one civilization is a civilization that begins to alter his or her looks .
and we 've been doing that for thousands of years .
you 've got tummy tucks and you 've got this and you 've got that .
( laughter ) seems odd .
maybe you breathe by having oxygen flow through your blood instead of through your lungs .
and some of them may be earth-like .
so if you want to start exploring beaches somewhere else , or you want to see two-sun sunsets , then you 're talking about something that is very different , because you have to change the timescale and the body of humans in ways which may be absolutely unrecognizable .
and that 's a life four civilization .
and let me give you two examples .
so this is the wonderful floyd romesberg , and one of the things that floyd 's been doing is he 's been playing with the basic chemistry of life .
maybe you make plants that are immune to all bacteria .
it means you can create alternate chemistries to us that could be chemistries adaptable to a very different planet that could create life and heredity .
the second experiment , or the other implication of this experiment , is that all of you , all life is based on 20 amino acids .
if you do n't substitute two amino acids , if you do n't say atxy , if you say atcg + xy , then you go from 20 building blocks to 172 , and all of a sudden you 've got 172 building blocks of amino acids to build life-forms in very different shapes .
the second experiment to think about is a really weird experiment that 's been taking place in china .
so this guy has been transplanting hundreds of mouse heads .
right ?
`` do you feel anything for this person ? '' '' we laugh about that today . ''
and boy , does that have implications .
second option : the new mouse recognizes minnie mouse .
and then the really interesting question is , if you can transplant this , is the only input-output mechanism this down here ?
well , i 'll tell you why .
and if that little thing goes , all of humanity goes .
( applause )
so let 's start with some good news , and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases ?
today , some 25 , 30 years later , we 're talking about a mortality rate that 's reduced by 85 percent .
heart disease used to be the biggest killer , particularly for men in their 40s .
aids , incredibly , has just been named , in the past month , a chronic disease , meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with hiv is expected not to live weeks , months , or a couple of years , as we said only a decade ago , but is thought to live decades , probably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether .
these are just remarkable , remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers .
early detection , early intervention , that 's the story for these successes .
unfortunately , the news is not all good .
let 's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide .
now this is , of course , not a disease , per se .
what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is .
that means one about every 15 minutes .
third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
it 's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatalities in this country .
if you look at disability , as measured by the world health organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years , it 's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist , except it 's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes , and as you can see , virtually 30 percent of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders , neuropsychiatric syndromes .
you 're probably thinking that does n't make any sense .
i mean , cancer seems far more serious .
but you can see actually they are further down this list , and that 's because we 're talking here about disability .
about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime .
a second , of course , is that , for some people , these become truly disabling , and it 's about four to five percent , perhaps one in 20 .
but what really drives these numbers , this high morbidity , and to some extent the high mortality , is the fact that these start very early in life .
and maybe at this point , when you know what i do , or maybe what i 've failed to do , you 'll think that i probably ought to be fired , and i could certainly understand that .
but what i want to suggest , and the reason i 'm here is to tell you that i think we 're about to be in a very different world as we think about these illnesses .
`` now , for some of you , you 're going to say , `` '' oh my goodness , here we go again . ''
we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports our own minds .
in a sense , it actually makes you feel that when you 're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition , something you can observe , that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex , mysterious organ that we 're beginning to try to understand .
now , already in the case of the brain disorders that i 've been talking to you about , depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , while we do n't have an in-depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses , we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences , or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders .
we call this the human connectome , and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain .
the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders , the one in five of us who struggle in some way , you find that there 's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired , but there are some predictable patterns , and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders .
here we 're talking about traffic jams , or sometimes detours , or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions .
you could , if you want , compare this to , on the one hand , a myocardial infarction , a heart attack , where you have dead tissue in the heart , versus an arrhythmia , where the organ simply is n't functioning because of the communication problems within it .
and it 's important , if you try to model this , you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical mass , loss of cortical gray matter , and what 's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark , and at some point , when you overshoot , you cross a threshold , and it 's that threshold where we say , this is a person who has this disease , because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions .
but look at this closely and you can see that actually they 've crossed a different threshold .
there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change .
the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier , long before the symptoms emerge .
but most important , go back to where we started .
if we waited until the heart attack , we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease .
we wait until the behavior becomes manifest .
are we going to be there soon ?
how about this word ?
now , one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people do n't usually have a kind of warm , fuzzy , snuggly image of the dictionary .
our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign .
so , there 's this guy , right ? victorian era .
and of course , a few of us are saying : okay , computers !
and ok , what about online dictionaries , right ?
online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen .
we have a pan that 's too small !
how can this be ? i mean , i love books . i really love books .
you know , there 're still going to be paper dictionaries , but it 's not going to be the dominant dictionary .
and i think this is a problem .
if you love a word , use it . that makes it real .
being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction .
but if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic , but maybe to count the cars that go by , then more eyeballs are better .
if you ask for help , you get more done . and we really need help .
see , i just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers , and this is more of a visual explanation .
and we do n't even know the shape of the language .
we just do n't know enough , and we do n't even know that we 're missing california .
so again , lexicography is not rocket science .
if you do n't know the provenance or the source of the artifact , it 's not science , it 's a pretty thing to look at .
does n't everyone want more meaning in their lives ?
each of us has a dream when we come here , a dream that usually has to be rewritten and always has to be repurposed .
i was one of the lucky ones .
but i do n't want you to think it was a cakewalk , that america opened its arms wide and welcomed me .
it 's still not doing that .
i came because i wanted to study english literature .
you see , as a child , i buried my nose in books , and i thought , why not make a living doing that as an adult ?
the door that i thought was open was actually just slightly ajar — this door of america that would open wide if you had the right name , the right skin color , the right networks , but could just slam in your face if you had the wrong religion , the wrong immigration status , the wrong skin color .
and i just could n't accept that .
in that work , i became and advocate for south asians and other immigrants .
and then in december of 2000 , i joined hundreds of other immigrants in a hall in brooklyn where we pledged our loyalty to a country that we had long considered home .
and soon after i had taken that formal step to becoming an american , the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , changed the immigration landscape for decades to come .
we also adopted by ballot referendum the office of immigrant affairs for the city of new york .
the attacks of september 11 sent shock waves through my community .
and now i was going to represent their concerns in government .
no job felt more perfect for me .
the second thing i learned is that when people like me , who understood that fear , who had learned a new language , who had navigated new systems , when people like us were sitting at the table , we advocated for our communities ' needs in a way that no one else could or would .
so in 2012 , half of the latino and asian-american voters did not vote .
they matter in local and state elections .
in 2015 , lan diep , the eldest son of political refugees from vietnam , ran for a seat in the san jose city council .
this year , he dusted off those campaign shoes and went back to run for that seat , and this time he won , by 12 votes .
every one of our votes matters .
and when people like lan are sitting at the policy table , they can make a difference .
she is a first-generation college student .
we have fought to be here .
we have come for political and religious freedom .
we have come in the pursuit of love .
her mother is part italian , part mexican and part german .
together they moved to arizona and built a life .
it 's not just my work . it 's also yours .
and it 's not going to be easy .
we never know what putting a new factor into an equation will do .
you 're scared that i 'm going to take away your place at the table , and i 'm scared that i 'm never going to get a place at the table .
thank you .
( applause )
so my name is taylor wilson .
and i would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point , that the bridge that t. boone pickens talked about will get us to .
so nuclear fusion is our energy future .
and the second point , making the case that kids can really change the world .
so you may ask — ( applause ) you may ask me , well how do you know what our energy future is ?
that is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor .
i decided i wanted to make a star .
now most of you are probably saying , well there 's no such thing as nuclear fusion .
well it does n't break even .
it does n't produce more energy out than i put in , but it still does some pretty cool stuff .
so this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that 's going on inside the sun .
and i 'm slamming it together so hard that that hydrogen fuses together , and in the process it has some byproducts , and i utilize those byproducts .
so this previous year , i won the intel international science and engineering fair .
( applause ) and i 've developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
so maybe i do n't want to admit to that .
this is me at cern in geneva , switzerland , which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world .
`` ( applause ) so in about seven years of doing nuclear research , i started out with a dream to make a `` '' star in a jar , '' '' a star in my garage , and i ended up meeting the president and developing things that i think can change the world , and i think other kids can too . ''
so thank you very much .
the woman i thought i was would have said yes .
but i had been commuting for two years between washington and princeton , new jersey , where my husband and my two teenage sons lived , and it was not going well .
i tried on the idea of eking out another two years in washington , or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me .
that was a decision based on love and responsibility .
but the real change came more gradually .
i am still completely committed to the cause of male-female equality , but let 's think about what that equality really means , and how best to achieve it .
i always accepted the idea that the most respected and powerful people in our society are men at the top of their careers , so that the measure of male-female equality ought to be how many women are in those positions : prime ministers , presidents , ceos , directors , managers , nobel laureates , leaders .
but that 's only half of real equality , and i now think we 're never going to get there unless we recognize the other half .
i suggest that real equality , full equality , does not just mean valuing women on male terms .
and to get there , we have to change our workplaces , our policies and our culture .
in the workplace , real equality means valuing family just as much as work , and understanding that the two reinforce each other .
and breadwinners who are also caregivers have a much wider range of experiences and contacts .
think about a lawyer who spends part of his time at school events for his kids talking to other parents .
he 's much more likely to bring in new clients for his firm than a lawyer who never leaves his office .
so you may think that the privileging of work over family is only an american problem .
in policy terms , real equality means recognizing that the work that women have traditionally done is just as important as the work that men have traditionally done , no matter who does it .
think about it : breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival .
at least if we get beyond a barter economy , somebody has to earn an income and someone else has to convert that income to care and sustenance for loved ones .
they love being mothers , but they also love their work , and they 're really good at what they do .
and what criteria should they use to make that decision ?
is it who makes the most money or who is most committed to her career ?
or who has the most flexible boss ?
the same-sex perspective helps us see that juggling work and family are not women 's problems , they 're family problems .
and sarah and emily are the lucky ones , because they have a choice about how much they want to work .
millions of men and women have to be both breadwinners and caregivers just to earn the income they need , and many of those workers are scrambling .
those societies also show you that breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other .
they routinely rank among the top 15 countries of the most globally competitive economies , but at the same time , they rank very high on the oecd better life index .
in fact , they rank higher than other governments , like my own , the u.s. , or switzerland , that have higher average levels of income but lower rankings on work-life balance .
so changing our workplaces and building infrastructures of care would make a big difference , but we 're not going to get equally valued choices unless we change our culture , and the kind of cultural change required means re-socializing men .
men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners , that to derive their self-worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder .
the feminist revolution still has a long way to go .
it 's certainly not complete .
we can decide to be a breadwinner , a caregiver , or any combination of the two .
when a man , on the other hand , decides to be a caregiver , he puts his manhood on the line .
and as many women hold that view as men do .
we know that lots of women still judge the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career .
so as parents and partners , we should be socializing our sons and our husbands to be whatever they want to be , either caregivers or breadwinners .
`` indeed , there are male college students now who are starting to say , `` i want to be a stay-at-home dad . '' ''
that was completely unthinkable 50 or even 30 years ago .
that means that it 's starting to seem like a character defect not to want to be a fully engaged father .
thirty years ago , carol gilligan , a wonderful psychologist , studied adolescent girls and identified an ethic of care , an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice .
he argues that the two great forces of human nature are self-interest and caring for others .
let 's make the feminist revolution a humanist revolution .
as whole human beings , we will be better caregivers and breadwinners .
the revolution for human equality can happen .
it is happening .
how far and how fast is up to us .
thank you .
can any of you remember what you wanted to be when you were 17 ?
i wanted to be a biker chick .
and on my seventeenth birthday , my parents , knowing how much i loved speed , gave me one driving lesson for my seventeenth birthday .
and on my seventeenth birthday , i accompanied my little sister in complete innocence , as i always had all my life — my visually impaired sister — to go to see an eye specialist .
so i used to get my eyes tested just for fun .
`` and he turned to my mother , and he said , `` '' you have n't told her yet ? '' '' on my seventeenth birthday , as janis ian would best say , i learned the truth at 17 . ''
i am , and have been since birth , legally blind .
and you know , how on earth did i get to 17 and not know that ?
`` well , if anybody says country music is n't powerful , let me tell you this : i got there because my father 's passion for johnny cash and a song , `` '' a boy named sue . '' '' i 'm the eldest of three . i was born in 1971 . ''
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ?
i ca n't see this clock and i ca n't see the timing , so holy god , woohoo ! ( laughter ) i might buy some more time .
but more importantly , let me tell you — i 'm going to come up really close here . do n't freak out , pat .
hey .
see this hand ?
every man in this room , even you , steve , is george clooney .
( laughter ) and every woman , you are so beautiful .
no special needs schools .
no limitations .
my ability and my potential .
and they decided to tell me that i could see .
so just like johnny cash 's sue , a boy given a girl 's name , i would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive , when they were no longer there to protect me , or just take it all away .
`` and do n't get me wrong , because when i first heard it — aside from the fact that i thought he was insane — i got that thump in my chest , just that `` '' huh ? '' '' but very quickly i recovered . it was like that . ''
`` and i swear to god , i walked out of his office , `` '' i will drive . i will drive . ''
`` you 're mad . i 'll drive . i know i can drive . '' '' and with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since i was such a child — he taught me how to sail , knowing i could never see where i was going , i could never see the shore , and i could n't see the sails , and i could n't see the destination . ''
and that wind in my face made me believe that he was mad and i would drive .
and for the next 11 years , i swore nobody would ever find out that i could n't see , because i did n't want to be a failure , and i did n't want to be weak .
so i rammed through life as only a casey can do .
and i was an archeologist , and then i broke things .
and then i managed a restaurant , and then i slipped on things .
and they did n't even know .
and temporarily , very unexpectedly , they dropped .
and i found myself in front of an hr manager in 1999 , saying something i never imagined that i would say .
i was 28 years old .
i had built a persona all around what i could and could n't do .
`` and i simply said , `` '' i 'm sorry . ''
`` i ca n't see , and i need help . '' '' asking for help can be incredibly difficult . ''
and you all know what it is . you do n't need to have a disability to know that .
we all know how hard it is to admit weakness and failure .
and can i tell you , operating in the sighted world when you ca n't see , it 's kind of difficult — it really is .
can i tell you , airports are a disaster .
i always end up in the gents ' toilets .
but can i just tell you , the little sign for a gents ' toilet or a ladies ' toilet is determined by a triangle .
have you ever tried to see that if you have vaseline in front of your eyes ?
and you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you 're not , or to be somebody that you are n't ?
and so after admitting i could n't see to hr , they sent me off to an eye specialist .
and i had no idea that this man was going to change my life .
and that eye specialist , he did n't bother testing my eyes .
god no , it was therapy .
`` i love accenture . i love accenture . i love my job . i love accenture . '' '' ( laughter ) to leave would be failure . ''
`` and then he said to me , `` '' what did you want to be when you were little ? '' '' now listen , i was n't going to say to him , `` '' well , i wanted to race cars and motorbikes . '' '' hardly appropriate at this moment in time . ''
he thought i was mad enough anyway .
`` and as i left his office , he called me back and he said , `` '' i think it 's time . i think it 's time ''
`` to stop fighting and do something different . '' '' and that door closed . ''
and my chest ached .
`` and i went home , and , because the pain in my chest ached so much , i thought , `` '' i 'll go out for a run . '' '' really not a very sensible thing to do . ''
i count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with .
and there i was crying away , and smash , bash on my rock .
and i did n't know what to do .
`` what am i going to be ? '' '' and i thought about my dad , and i thought , `` '' good god , i 'm so not sue now . '' '' and i kept thinking over and over in my mind , what had happened ? where did it go wrong ? why did n't i understand ? ''
and you know , the extraordinary part of it is i just simply had no answers .
i had lost my belief .
`` and then i remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me , `` '' what do you want to be ? what do you want to be ? ''
what did you want to be when you were little ? do you love what you do ?
do something different . what do you want to be ?
`` do something different . what do you want to be ? '' '' and really slowly , slowly , slowly , it happened . ''
`` you do n't get more different than that . '' '' and the moment , and i mean the moment , the moment that hit me , i swear to god , it was like woo hoo ! you know — something to believe in . ''
but you ca n't tell me , no , i ca n't be mowgli , because guess what ?
and i sprinted home , and i did n't fall , and i did n't crash .
i know how to be mowgli .
nine months later , after that day on snot rock , i had the only blind date in my life with a seven and a half foot elephant called kanchi .
and together we would trek a thousand kilometers across india .
but you know , i was believing in the wrong thing .
because i was n't believing in me , really me , all the bits of me — all the bits of all of us .
do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we 're not ?
and you know what , when you really believe in yourself and everything about you , it 's extraordinary what happens .
and you know what , that trip , that thousand kilometers , it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations .
and i set up kanchi , because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant , because disability is like the elephant in the room .
and i wanted to make you see it in a positive way — no charity , no pity .
that 's what i wanted to do .
and i never thought about noes anymore , or not seeing , or any of that kind of nothing .
but as i was traveling here , you 'll be very happy to know , i did use my white symbol stick cane , because it 's really good to skip queues in the airport .
and i got my way here being happily proud that i could n't see .
and the one thing is that a really good friend of mine , he texted me on the way over , knowing i was scared .
even though i present confident , i was scared .
`` he said , `` '' be you . '' '' and so here i am . ''
( applause ) and i have learned , you know what , cars and motorbikes and elephants , that 's not freedom .
being absolutely true to yourself is freedom .
i simply needed vision and belief .
and if you truly believe — and i mean believe from the bottom of your heart — you can make change happen .
losing of labels , because we are not jam jars .
`` it 's a haflinger horse cloned in italy , a real `` '' gold ring '' '' of cloning , because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings . ''
in other words , the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed .
but if you can clone that horse , you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud .
these were the first cloned calves , the first cloned grey wolves , and then , finally , the first cloned piglets : alexis , chista , carrel , janie and dotcom .
it 's funny the things you forget .
i do n't know about that , but i just know that i get too many marketing emails .
and i was really annoyed with them , and i thought , ok , i was about to write a strongly worded email , which i can do quite well .
`` so i replied to it , and i said , `` i literally can not wait ! ! ! ! '' ''
`` ( laughter ) `` what do you need from me ? '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' what 's the plan , dan ? ''
and that changed my mindset forever .
and on that axis i have life expectancy , the health of people .
and they were catching up indeed .
you see this enormous inequity in china , in the midst of fast economic growth .
i teach chemistry .
have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over ?
some people nodding yes .
recently , i showed this to my students , and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened .
check out this video that maddie from my period three class sent me that evening .
( clang ) ( laughs ) now obviously , as maddie 's chemistry teacher , i love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class .
but if instead we have the guts to confuse our students , perplex them , and evoke real questions , through those questions , we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction .
so , 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside , the truth is , i 've been teaching for 13 years now , and it took a life-threatening situation to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning , not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information .
this led to open-heart surgery . this is the actual real email from my doctor right there .
now , when i got this , i was — press caps lock — absolutely freaked out , okay ?
he said first , his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure , about what worked and what did n't work .
and third , through intense reflection , he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure , and then , with a steady hand , he saved my life .
we 're all teachers . we know learning is ugly .
and just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one of the one that we all skip , okay , trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at sacred heart cathedral in room 206 .
and rule number three : practice reflection .
as if what we are doing one day will save lives .
our students our worth it .
and each case is different .
so these are my daughters .
on the right we have little emmalou — southern family .
`` she 's going to be four years old , and anyone who knows a four-year-old knows that they love to ask , `` '' why ? '' '' yeah . why . ''
but the challenge is really for riley 's future teachers , the ones she has yet to meet .
but if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry , we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day , and spark their imagination .
( applause )
so , a big question that we 're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now : are we at risk of a nuclear attack ?
now , there 's a bigger question that 's probably actually more important than that , is the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility of a nuclear attack , eliminating the threat altogether .
we had a few nuclear weapons , two of which we dropped on japan , in hiroshima , a few days later in nagasaki , in august 1945 , killing about 250,000 people between those two .
but i want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since 1985 — going forward , of course — were part of the arsenals of the united states and the soviet union .
`` it 's a very difficult number to deal with , because what we 've done is we 've quote unquote `` '' decommissioned '' '' some of the warheads . ''
so we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world , but a very different set of circumstances .
chapter one is 1949 to 1991 , when the soviet union broke up , and what we were dealing with , at that point and through those years , was a superpowers ' nuclear arms race .
and basically , we lived for all those years , and some might argue that we still do , in a situation of being on the brink , literally , of an apocalyptic , planetary calamity .
it 's incredible that we actually lived through all that .
it stands for mutually assured destruction .
so the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you . that 's the way we lived .
during this chapter one , there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe , and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that , in fact , a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could , in some ways , mean the end of civilization as we know it .
so this was chapter one .
now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration , we engaged in america in a series — and in fact , in the soviet union — in a series of response planning .
it was absolutely incredible .
so what we offered ourselves was a collection of things . i 'm just going to go skim through a few things , just to jog your memories .
and actually — so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters .
or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground .
now , the bomb shelters at that point — let 's say you bought a prefab one — it would be a few hundred dollars , maybe up to 500 , if you got a fancy one .
yet , what percentage of americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house ?
what percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter ?
here is their first big public announcement .
they would propose — actually there were about six volumes written on this — a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the united states having three to four days warning that the soviets were going to attack us .
so the goal was to evacuate the target cities .
we would move people out of the target cities into the countryside .
and i 'm telling you , i actually testified at the senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate , and actually have three or four days ' warning .
it was just really , really frightening .
`` they would do a bombing run . they 'd go to your city , and they 'd say , `` '' here 's a map of your city . ''
so we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive .
and what happened was — when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era , which started back in 1945 .
although the scenario has changed very considerably , the fact is that we have n't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means .
so i 'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second .
and there 's four key ingredients to describing that .
and it 's particularly not secure in the former soviet union , now in russia .
they 're available to be bought , stolen , whatever .
they 're acquirable , let me put it that way .
from 1993 through 2006 , the international atomic energy agency documented 175 cases of nuclear theft , 18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium , the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon .
how much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb ?
so , what i 'd like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly enriched uranium .
the second thing is , what about the know-how ?
and there 's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know-how to actually make a nuclear weapon .
there 's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts .
there are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it .
all of this information is relatively available .
the third element of the nuclear terror threat is that , who would actually do such a thing ?
they are very dedicated and committed .
and they 're retaliation-proof .
since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference , since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us , it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work .
here is sulaiman abu ghaith , and sulaiman was a key lieutenant of osama bin laden .
`` he wrote many , many times statements to this effect : `` '' we have the right to kill four million americans , two million of whom should be children . '' '' and we do n't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm , for whatever their reasons . ''
what if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon ?
the fourth element is that the high-value u.s. targets are accessible , soft and plentiful .
this would be a talk for another day , but the level of the preparedness that the united states has achieved since 9/11 of '01 is unbelievably inadequate .
five to seven percent only are inspected — five to seven percent .
this is alexander lebed , who was a general that worked with yeltsin , who talked about , and presented to congress , this idea that the russians had developed — these suitcase bombs . they were very low yield — 0.1 to one kiloton , hiroshima was around 13 kilotons — but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage .
you take it wherever you want to take it , and you can detonate it .
you do n't want to build a suitcase bomb , and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist .
it could happen . but what it would mean and who would survive ?
you ca n't get an exact number for that kind of probability , but what i 'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .
anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves .
i think there 's a lot of people in the intelligence community — a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it 's almost inevitable , unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk , like better interdiction , better prevention , better fixing , you know , better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth .
i do n't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon , although even that is not completely off the table .
there 's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the earth many , many times over .
there are flash points in india and pakistan , in the middle east , in north korea , other places where the use of nuclear weapons , while initially locally , could very rapidly go into a situation where we 'd be facing all-out nuclear war .
`` this is a 10-kiloton bomb , slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima . and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information . i think — `` '' news you could use '' '' kind of concept here . ''
if you 're right where the bomb went off , you will be vaporized . and that 's — i 'm just telling you , this is not good .
two-mile radius , you have a 50 percent chance of being killed , and up to about eight miles away — now i 'm talking about killed instantly — somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent chance of getting killed .
the thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is — first of all , tens of millions of degrees fahrenheit at the core here , where it goes off , and an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat , acute radiation and blast effects .
my point now , though , is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here , if you 've survived the initial blast .
you have , when the blast goes off — and by the way , if it ever comes up , do n't look at it .
in that 10 to 15 minutes , all you have to do — and i mean this seriously — is go about a mile away from the blast .
if you ca n't get out of there , we want you to go into a shelter and stay there .
now , in a shelter in an urban area means you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible , or you have to be on a floor — on a high floor — if it 's a ground burst explosion , which it would be , higher than the ninth floor . so you have to be tenth floor or higher , or in the basement .
but basically , you 've got to get out of town as quickly as possible .
and if you 're in the direct fallout zone here , you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there , and that 's clear . but if you are sheltered , you can actually survive .
the difference between knowing information of what you 're going to do personally , and not knowing information , can save your life , and it could mean the difference between 150,000 to 200,000 fatalities from something like this and half a million to 700,000 fatalities .
`` you say `` '' nuclear '' '' to them , and they 're thinking , `` oh my god , we 're all gone . what 's the point ? it 's futile . '' ''
`` and we 're trying to tell them , `` '' it 's not futile . ''
the key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out , and not going into harm 's way .
so separation — hopefully with dirt or concrete , or being in a basement — distance and time is what will save you .
and shelter and place . you want to move [ only ] crosswind for 1.2 miles .
and finally , you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible .
and jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything , whether it 's war or terrorism , is abolition of nuclear weapons .
and you want something to work on once you 've fixed global warming , i urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable , inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world .
this was sent to me by somebody who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures , but the fact of the matter is that america 's gone through a very hard time .
we 've not been focused , we 've not done what we had to do , and now we 're facing the potential of bad , hell on earth .
so my life was constantly in a state of rushing .
but , as i grew up , i had this sinking realization , that i was n't gon na get to live any more than one life .
it did n't always work this way .
my father was born into this world of black and white .
`` `` '' follow the light , '' '' he said . ''
`` `` follow the light . '' ''
the loft on wooster street with the creaky hallways , the twelve-foot ceilings , white walls and cold floors .
they got married . had a baby .
moved to a house near a park .
but they kept the loft on wooster street for birthday parties and treasure hunts .
and the house near the park became a house under ash , so they escaped in backpacks , on bicycles to darkrooms but the loft of wooster street was built for an artist , not a family of pigeons , and walls that do not reach the ceiling do not hold in the yelling and the man with basketball hands put his weapons out to rest .
his hands no longer fit his camera , no longer fit his wife 's , no longer fit his body .
the sweet potato boy mashed his fists into his mouth until he had nothing more to say .
a year later he traveled across the country to follow a forest fire stayed for a week hunting it with his camera , it was ravaging the west coast eating 18-wheeler trucks in its stride .
on the other side of the country , i went to class and wrote a poem in the margins of my notebook .
maybe we are learning the art of letting go .
`` i was trying to remember all the guidebooks , and all i could remember was , `` '' only answer the question they 're asking . ''
and yet , america and africa have got a common interest .
i make large-scale figurative paintings , which means i paint people like this .
but i 'm here tonight to tell you about something personal that changed my work and my perspective .
to give you some background on me , i grew up the youngest of eight .
yes , eight kids in my family .
we had a regular car , too .
she even took a class with me in new york city .
that was my private world .
by 14 , i knew i really wanted to be an artist .
so i continued honing my skills .
`` i went to graduate school and i got an mfa , and at my first solo show , my brother asked me , `` what do all these red dots mean next to the paintings ? '' ''
here 's a painting from back around that time .
bathtubs and showers were the perfect enclosed environment .
i was having some success and recognition and i moved into an apartment with more than four outlets .
it had spread to her bones , and it was in her brain .
i just needed to ask her .
time slowed down , and the date was irrelevant .
she had this huge mug she made she loved to drink her coffee out of , and she loved irish soda bread for breakfast .
my brothers would come in the evenings and bring their kids , and that was the highlight of her day .
i could n't support her myself anymore , so we hired an aide to help me with the showers .
she was gone .
i 'm so grateful for them .
this was the most important thing .
so after the funeral , it was time for me to go back to my studio .
and here 's what happened .
that safe , very , very carefully rendered safe place that i created in all my other paintings , it was a myth .
and i was afraid , because i did n't want to paint anymore .
so i went into the woods .
by the morning it was lacquered with bugs .
but i did n't care . it did n't matter . it did n't matter .
this is the one with all the bugs in it .
i got curious again .
this is another one from the woods .
i started to be as curious as i was when i was a student .
i 'm going outside instead of inside .
and in that imperfection , you can find a vulnerability .
we 're going to lose our health , people we love .
these kinds of losses are out of our control .
they 're unpredictable , and they bring us to our knees .
and so i say , let them .
it 's what we all want .
let 's take the opportunity to find something beautiful in the unknown , in the unpredictable , and even in the awful .
all of these were released by us .
my mom made me leave my dolls in the minivan .
this was the beginning .
in my home , life was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil .
initially , the people i encountered on the platform were just as hostile as i expected .
it took time , but eventually these conversations planted seeds of doubt in me .
these realizations were life-altering .
in spite of overwhelming grief and terror , i left westboro in 2012 .
`` the world had access to my past because it was all over the internet — thousands of tweets and hundreds of interviews , everything from local tv news to `` '' the howard stern show '' '' — but so many embraced me with open arms anyway . ''
no nuance , no complexity , no humanity .
we even target people on our own side when they dare to question the party line .
this path has brought us cruel , sniping , deepening polarization , and even outbreaks of violence .
what gives me hope is that we can do something about this .
we have to talk and listen to people we disagree with .
it 's hard because it means extending empathy and compassion to people who show us hostility and contempt .
the impulse to respond in kind is so tempting , but that is n't who we want to be .
we can resist .
what was special was their approach .
it fundamentally changed the dynamic of our conversation .
at westboro , i learned not to care how my manner of speaking affected others .
instead , he would change the subject .
we can use that buffer .
and finally ...
make the argument .
my friends on twitter did n't abandon their beliefs or their principles — only their scorn .
but to me , she was missing the bigger picture — that we 're all just human beings .
we just have to decide that it 's going to start with us .
thank you .
it 's a journey into the foreign territory of somebody else 's life , a journey , an exploration that can take you places you never dreamed of going and still ca n't quite believe you 've been , especially if , like me , you 're an agnostic jew and the life you 've been exploring is that of muhammad .
what happened , that is , on the night in the year 610 when muhammad received the first revelation of the koran on a mountain just outside mecca ?
i was fully aware that for someone as secular as i am , just asking it could be seen as pure chutzpah .
( laughter ) and i plead guilty as charged , because all exploration , physical or intellectual , is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression , of crossing boundaries .
still , some boundaries are larger than others .
which might be why when i looked at the earliest accounts we have of that night , what struck me even more than what happened was what did not happen .
muhammad did not come floating off the mountain as though walking on air .
`` he did not run down shouting , `` '' hallelujah ! '' '' and `` '' bless the lord ! '' '' he did not radiate light and joy . ''
at best , he thought , it had to have been a hallucination — a trick of the eye or the ear , perhaps , or his own mind working against him .
at worst , possession — that he 'd been seized by an evil jinn , a spirit out to deceive him , even to crush the life out of him .
in fact , he was so sure that he could only be majnun , possessed by a jinn , that when he found himself still alive , his first impulse was to finish the job himself , to leap off the highest cliff and escape the terror of what he 'd experienced by putting an end to all experience .
he was overwhelmed not with conviction , but by doubt .
with the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake , we 're protected from real awe .
too human for some , like conservative muslim theologians who maintain that the account of his wanting to kill himself should n't even be mentioned , despite the fact that it 's in the earliest islamic biographies .
yet what , exactly , is imperfect about doubt ?
like fundamentalists of all religious stripes , they have no questions , only answers .
and yet we , the vast and still far too silent majority , have ceded the public arena to this extremist minority .
we 've allowed judaism to be claimed by violently messianic west bank settlers , christianity by homophobic hypocrites and misogynistic bigots , islam by suicide bombers .
and we 've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that no matter whether they claim to be christians , jews or muslims , militant extremists are none of the above .
they 're a cult all their own , blood brothers steeped in other people 's blood .
we have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers .
and this conscious defiance is why i , as an agnostic , can still have faith .
i 'm not convinced of this .
i can only have faith in it , commit myself , that is , to the idea of it , and i do this precisely because of the temptation to throw up my hands in resignation and retreat into silence .
because despair is self-fulfilling .
if we call something impossible , we act in such a way that we make it so .
in fact , most of us do , whether we 're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond , for that matter , what drives us is that , despite our doubts and even because of our doubts , we reject the nihilism of despair .
call this naive if you like .
call it impossibly idealistic if you must .
could muhammad have so radically changed his world without such faith , without the refusal to cede to the arrogance of closed-minded certainty ?
i think not .
after keeping company with him as a writer for the past five years , i ca n't see that he 'd be anything but utterly outraged at the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak and act in his name in the middle east and elsewhere today .
he 'd be appalled at the repression of half the population because of their gender .
he 'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism .
he 'd say what the koran says : anyone who takes a life takes the life of all humanity .
anyone who saves a life , saves the life of all humanity .
and he 'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process of making peace .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
i was looking at my phone . i thought , i could just delete this .
then i started to panic .
`` i said , `` '' solomon , attached to this email you 'll find a helpful chart . ''
`` `` '' the business is on . ''
and that 's what i 've been doing for three years on your behalf .
she sent me this , which is hysterical .
`` she said , `` '' kindly comply with my bankers instructions . ''
i 'm a grandmother .
got ta get through another year .
i 'm doing time here . this is not my home .
because i 've changed .
i 've been incarcerated for 27 years .
i was born and raised in philadelphia , p.a .
i 've been incarcerated for 27 years .
my name is debra brown .
this is not my home .
this poses a paradox .
why are there so many jobs ?
there are actually two fundamental economic principles at stake .
there 's a general principle here .
it increases their economic value .
probably something else will break anyway .
in 1900 , 40 percent of all us employment was on farms .
but people desire these things , and they 're willing to work hard for them .
( laughter ) but they have n't used that wealth equally well to foster human prosperity , human prospering .
norway has invested to build a society with opportunity and economic mobility .
and this brings me to the challenge that we face today , the challenge that automation poses for us .
many of them would be unemployable .
it 's foolish to say there 's nothing to worry about .
now , i started this talk with a paradox .
now , you may be thinking , professor autor has told us a heartwarming tale about the distant past , the recent past , maybe the present , but probably not the future .
these predictions strike me as arrogant .
but the future does n't hinge on my imagination .
thank you very much .
`` and my mum said , `` '' darling , remember that you ca n't see and you ca n't feel the picture and you ca n't feel the print on the page . '' '' and i thought to myself , `` '' but that 's what i want to do . ''
little did i know , lying curled up in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948 that i 'd been born at the right place and the right time , that i was in a country where i could participate in the technological revolution .
and so i want to tell you about the interaction between computer-based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person i am today .
it 's an interaction between volunteers , passionate inventors and technology , and it 's a story that many other blind people could tell .
but let me tell you a bit about it today .
it 's an ingenious system of six dots that are punched into paper , and i can feel them with my fingers .
i do n't know where julian morrow got that from .
when you leave the opera house , you 'll find there 's braille signage in the lifts .
look for it . have you noticed it ?
( laughter ) when i was at school , the books were transcribed by transcribers , voluntary people who punched one dot at a time so i 'd have volumes to read , and that had been going on , mainly by women , since the late 19th century in this country , but it was the only way i could read .
i could have family and friends read me material , and i could then read it back as many times as i needed .
and it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers .
i gave them a tape recorder , and they read into it .
in fact , in my office in 1990 , i had 18 miles of tape .
one of the reasons i agreed to give this talk today was that i was hoping that lois would be here so i could introduce you to her and publicly thank her .
but sadly , her health has n't permitted her to come today .
how very wrong i was .
see it up there ?
and you see it has no , what do you call it , no screen .
( laughter ) it 's a blind computer . ( laughter )
do n't laugh , it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time . ( laughter ) i think there 's more memory in my watch .
it was invented by russell smith , a passionate inventor in new zealand who was trying to help blind people .
optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font , but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers , he developed a machine that could read any font .
( laughter ) i no longer would be censored .
for example , i was too shy then , and i 'm actually too shy now , to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material .
that 's what it 's shrunk to .
one is another american inventor ted henter .
ted was a motorcycle racer , but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight , which is devastating if you 're trying to ride motorbikes .
but in 1989 , he teamed up with bill joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the net or from what was on the computer .
it 's called jaws , job access with speech , and it sounds like this .
( laughter ) you see , if i read like that , i 'd fall asleep .
i slowed it down for you .
i 'm going to ask that we play it at the speed i read it .
can we play that one ?
( jaws speaking ) ( laughter ) rm : you know , when you 're marking student essays , you want to get through them fairly quickly .
i still love being close to someone reading to me .
but when i 'm reading with synthetic voices , i love to come home and read a racy novel with a real voice .
now there are still barriers in front of we people with disabilities .
for example , australia , like about one third of the world 's countries , has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled or read for we blind persons .
for example , in spain , there are a 100,000 accessible books in spanish .
in argentina , there are 50,000 .
there are hundreds of thousands of accessible books in the united states , britain , canada , australia , etc. , but they ca n't be transported to the 60 countries in our world where english is the first and the second language .
and remember i was telling you about harry potter .
and that 's why , next month in morocco , a meeting is taking place between all the countries .
bless you . thank you very much .
we put together , very quickly , a washroom .
so how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective ?
this brings us to the second piece of bad news .
but what if your destination does n't have an exit on the highway ?
the drugs navigate throughout all of your body .
to me , it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole-body treatment to target a specific organ .
currently , the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer .
thank you very much .
the language i 'm speaking right now is on its way to becoming the world 's universal language , for better or for worse .
last i heard , there are two dozen universities in china right now teaching all in english .
and in addition to that , it 's been predicted that at the end of the century almost all of the languages that exist now — there are about 6,000 — will no longer be spoken .
the reason i 'm reciting those things to you is because i can tell that we 're getting to the point where a question is going to start being asked , which is : why should we learn foreign languages — other than if english happens to be foreign to one ?
why bother to learn another one when it 's getting to the point where almost everybody in the world will be able to communicate in one ?
so it 's not that it 's untrue completely .
`` so , `` '' la table , '' '' `` '' la mesa , '' '' you just have to deal with it . ''
it has been shown that if you are a speaker of one of those languages and you happen to be asked how you would imagine a table talking , then much more often than could possibly be an accident , a french or a spanish speaker says that the table would talk with a high and feminine voice .
so if you 're french or spanish , to you , a table is kind of a girl , as opposed to if you are an english speaker .
it 's hard not to love data like that , and many people will tell you that that means that there 's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages .
so for example , let 's take an english speaker .
up on the screen , that is bono .
i presume he has a worldview .
now , that is donald trump .
so here are three speakers of the english language .
what worldview do those three people have in common ?
what worldview is shaped through the english language that unites them ?
it 's not a matter of giving you a different pair of glasses on the world .
if it is n't going to change the way you think , what would the other reasons be ?
there are some .
one of them is that if you want to imbibe a culture , if you want to drink it in , if you want to become part of it , then whether or not the language channels the culture — and that seems doubtful — if you want to imbibe the culture , you have to control to some degree the language that the culture happens to be conducted in .
there 's no other way .
i have to go slightly obscure , but really you should seek it out .
`` there 's a movie by the canadian film director denys arcand — read out in english on the page , `` '' dennis ar-cand , '' '' if you want to look him up . ''
there 's one scene closest to the end , where they have to take a friend to an anglophone hospital .
and they speak it more slowly , they have accents , they 're not idiomatic .
suddenly these characters that you 've fallen in love with become husks of themselves , they 're shadows of themselves .
so that 's one reason .
bilingualism is healthy .
all those things have in common the consonants sitting in the middle like pillars .
`` so for example , `` the cat in the hat comes back , '' a book that i 'm sure we all often return to , like `` '' moby dick . '' '' one phrase in it is , `` '' do you know where i found him ? ''
you had to go to class .
it 's an awful lot of fun .
it wo n't change your mind , but it will most certainly blow your mind .
now the choosing begins .
but if your whole life has been engineered toward success , how will you handle the tough times ?
eventually , he quit .
i want to urge you to interview the scrapper .
we never owned a home , a car , a washing machine , and for most of my childhood , we did n't even have a telephone .
eleven years later , when the political landscape changed , he heard about a highly selective university admissions test .
having someone you can count on no matter what is essential to overcoming adversity .
so back to my original question .
hire the scrapper .
you know , i 've always wanted one of these .
( applause )
and third , layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed .
now , were it quite that easy , geologists would rejoice .
most pages are destroyed soon after being written .
thus , the volumes of earth history are incomplete and disheveled .
and you have to get yourself in a desert .
and we found this .
that 's over seven feet long .
and after three more hard , really brutal field seasons , the quarry came to look like this .
and there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me .
so can you imagine a big bull , 65-ton dreadnoughtus in the breeding season , defending a territory ?
and then came the long ...
nothing .
and then , in east africa , an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought .
sixty-six million years ago , an asteroid hits the earth and wipes out the dinosaurs .
this easily might not have been .
but this particular reality was not inevitable .
those two streams — they look identical .
but one is an anonymous trickle of water , and the other is the missouri river .
why study the ancient past ?
they did n't see it coming , and they did n't have a choice .
and the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet is both precarious and potentially fleeting .
only unlike the dinosaurs , we can see it coming .
thank you .
and now we 've evolved to the point where we ca n't survive without clothing .
i made a lot of my own toys .
they bend them to their will .
they change them to be the characters they want to be in those productions .
they 're super clever and genius .
and i take this to heart .
`` i learned that `` '' hrr hrr hrr '' '' — that head laugh that chewbacca does . ''
so i put together a no-face costume , and i wore it on the floor at comic-con .
i resolved i would not speak in this costume at all .
and i 'm feeling and i 'm walking the floor and it 's fantastic .
and about 15 minutes in something happens .
somebody grabs my hand , and they put a coin back into it .
understand , i ca n't see anything inside this costume .
thank you .
looked for something different for the second one .
it has a more transparent identity .
and they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters .
but apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed .
it tells where we have been , who we have met , and in many ways , even what we 're thinking about .
and the more scary part about this is our data now lasts forever , so your data can and will outlive you .
we have to really think .
so , the solution to this has been known for some time , and there 's many attempts to do it .
first , you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server .
this seems like common sense , right ?
if we want to have privacy online , what we have to do is we 've got to go out and get it ourselves .
what we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible .
we were a bit different .
well , it 's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server .
so here we have bob and alice , who want to communicate privately .
we have done the first step with protonmail , but this is really just the first step in a very , very long journey .
number three , a boy .
what 's next ?
( applause )
but this story only happened a few years ago .
there 's a historical marker .
`` `` not we , i . '' ''
`` `` how are you doing it ? '' ''
i 've got a white-knuckle grip on the door . you know what i 'm talking about ?
`` so , first i say , `` '' ma , why are we here ? '' '' `` you mean , like , in the car ? '' ''
`` `` look , the chevy — he 's coming this way . '' ''
she has amazing land speed for a woman her age , too .
`` `` i 'm with the little lady . damn ! '' ''
`` `` '' que ? '' '' which means `` '' what , '' '' and so much more . ''
some , they 're just right there , right there . put them right there .
the third thing was family .
cancer is a very clever disease .
we can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer as kind of supervillains in a comic book .
this is just one example of the many genetic tricks in the bag of our supervillain , cancer .
so , we have a supervillain with incredible superpowers .
actually , we can turn off a gene .
the key is a set of molecules known as sirna .
sirna are short sequences of genetic code that guide a cell to block a certain gene .
but , there is a problem .
it has to be packaged , protected through its journey through the body on its way to the final target inside the cancer cell .
but how do we carry that out ?
using molecular engineering , we can actually design a superweapon that can travel through the bloodstream .
first , let 's start with the nanoparticle core .
this is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell 's life .
we 're almost done .
and guess what ? our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object .
we have to sneak our nanoparticle past the tumor defense system .
second , this layer contains molecules which bind specifically to our tumor cell .
how about a driverless world ?
we 're number one , the united states is large and in charge .
that was the way the world worked .
this is how we landed for the most important meeting of the world 's leaders in china .
they look like they 're about to get into a cage match , right ?
that 's what putin wanted to talk about .
he 's increasingly calling the shots .
angela merkel has — she always does — that look , she always does that .
so if i 've convinced you of that , i want to do two things with the rest of this talk .
and then i want to talk about what we think right here in the united states and in new york .
we have large numbers of middle and working classes that feel like they 've not benefited from promises of globalization , so they do n't want to see it particularly .
they want their own preferences and order .
that 's why we are where we are .
let 's start easy , with the middle east .
one is because there was a willingness to provide some level of military security by the us and allies .
number two , it was easy to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground because oil was expensive .
and number three was no matter how bad the leaders were , the populations were relatively quiescent .
no , the kurds will do better , and iraq , israel , iran over time .
he 's playing a poor hand very well .
but long term — i did n't mean that .
in a g-zero world , this is going to be a very tense 10 years for mr. putin .
it 's not all bad . right ?
there are real leaders across asia , they have a lot of political stability .
those are the three most important economies in asia .
now look , there are problems in asia .
we see that kim jong un , just in the last couple of days , tested yet another nuclear weapon .
and that 's what they 're actually doing .
so much of what is happening in the middle east is washing up quite literally onto european shores .
you see brexit and you see the concerns of populism across all of the european states .
so europe was able to truly expand under the g7 , but under the g-zero , europe will get smaller .
core europe around germany and france and others will still work , be functional , stable , wealthy , integrated .
they had been more opposed to the united states for decades .
we see that in argentina .
we see it with the openness in cuba .
we will see it in brazil after the impeachment and when we finally see a new legitimate president elected there .
the only place you see that is moving in another direction is the unpopularity of mexican president peña nieto .
a lot of people have said it 's going to be africa 's decade , finally .
those countries can fall off the map .
so you 're really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the winners and the losers across africa .
those are awesome neighbors .
right ? i mean , the turks would love to have only 10,000 syrian refugees .
that 's not the situation .
here 's the challenge .
in a g-zero world , the way you lead is by example .
the election process this year is not proving a good option for leading by example .
hillary clinton says it 's going to be like the '90s .
`` he 's saying , `` '' our way or the highway . you do n't like it , lump it . '' '' right ? ''
are we prepared to truly lead by example ?
what would we have to do to fix this after november , after the next president comes in ?
another global financial crisis could do this .
thank you very , very much .
( applause )
and to me , this is research misconduct .
and this is not a difficult problem to fix .
i want to talk about sex for money .
i 'm not a police officer or a social worker .
every month my wages would just replenish my overdraft .
but it was n't going to happen anytime soon , and my rent needed paying .
in the years that have passed , i 've had a lot of time to think .
then i 'm going tell you about what we , as sex workers , actually want .
the first approach is full criminalization .
criminalization is a trap .
it 's hard to get a conventional job when you have a criminal record .
being criminalized leaves you exposed to mistreatment by the state itself .
imagine knowing if you 're busted carrying condoms , it 'll be used against you .
it 's a pretty strong incentive to leave them at home , right ?
what would you choose ?
let me tell you about mariana popa who worked in redbridge , east london .
but during a police crackdown on sex workers and their clients , she was forced to work alone to avoid being arrested .
she was stabbed to death in the early hours of october 29 , 2013 .
so if criminalizing sex workers hurts them , why not just criminalize the people who buy sex ?
if it 's a home or a hotel visit , i try to get a full name and details .
if i worked under the swedish model , a client would be too scared to give me that information .
can you afford to take the risk ?
can you afford not to ?
regulation sounds great on paper , but politicians deliberately make regulation around the sex industry expensive and difficult to comply with .
it creates a two-tiered system : legal and illegal work .
in this two-tiered system , the most vulnerable people are forced to work illegally , so they 're still exposed to all the dangers of criminalization i mentioned earlier .
fines and criminal records force people to keep selling sex , rather than enabling them to stop .
these are the groups most heavily profiled and punished through prohibitionist law .
these laws have political support precisely because they target people that voters do n't want to see or know about .
well , lots of people have understandable fears about trafficking .
folks think that foreign women kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery can be saved by shutting a whole industry down .
forced labor does occur in many industries , especially those where the workers are migrants or otherwise vulnerable , and this needs to be addressed .
when 23 undocumented chinese migrants drowned while picking cockles in morecambe bay in 2004 , there were no calls to outlaw the entire seafood industry to save trafficking victims .
the solution is clearly to give workers more legal protections , allowing them to resist abuse and report it to authorities without fear of arrest .
if someone needs to sell sex because they 're poor or because they 're homeless or because they 're undocumented and they ca n't find legal work , taking away that option does n't make them any less poor or house them or change their immigration status .
ask yourself : is it more degrading than going hungry or seeing your children go hungry ?
it 's the fact of poor migrant women selling sex specifically that has some feminists uncomfortable .
people have all kinds of complicated feelings when it comes to sex .
`` people get really hung up on the question , `` well , would you want your daughter doing it ? '' ''
that 's the wrong question .
why is n't she safer ?
new zealand decriminalized sex work in 2003 .
it 's crucial to remember that decriminalization and legalization are not the same thing .
decriminalization means the removal of laws that punitively target the sex industry , instead treating sex work much like any other kind of work .
we 're supported in our demands by global bodies like unaids , the world health organization and amnesty international .
we 've had complicated experiences and complicated responses to those experiences .
but our demands are not complicated .
we want full decriminalization and labor rights as workers .
well , nothing would have prepared us for the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face .
this means that his brain was not formed correctly because part of his skull was missing .
babies with this diagnosis typically die in utero or within a few minutes , hours or days of being born .
this helped me see thomas in a new light .
after six days , thomas died in ross 's arms surrounded by our family .
we called wrtc , who sent a van to our home and brought him to children 's national medical center .
his cord blood would go to duke university .
but i did find myself wondering , what 's happening now ?
i learned that they could even meet each other if they 'd both sign a waiver , almost like an open adoption .
and i was so excited , i thought maybe i could write a letter or i could get a letter and learn about what happened .
and i came up with an idea .
i explained who i was , and i asked if they could tell me why they requested infant retinas in march of 2010 , and i asked if my family could visit their lab .
she thanked me for the donation , and she explained that she is studying retinoblastoma , which is a deadly cancer of the retina that affects children under the age of five , and she said that yes , we were invited to visit her lab .
so next we talked on the phone , and one of the first things she said to me was that she could n't possibly imagine how we felt , and that thomas had given the ultimate sacrifice , and that she seemed to feel indebted to us .
`` so , never feel guilty about using this tissue . '' '' next , she explained to me how rare it was . ''
she had placed a request for this tissue six years earlier with the national disease research interchange .
after we hung up , i emailed her some pictures of thomas and callum , and a few weeks later , we received this t-shirt in the mail .
a few months later , ross , callum and i piled in the car and we went for a road trip .
the same way henrietta lacks is called hela , thomas was called res 360 .
it 's the same way that a military medal or a wedding certificate might be .
arupa also explained that she is using thomas 's retina and his rna to try to inactivate the gene that causes tumor formation , and she even showed us some results that were based on res 360 .
it was a child 's lab kit .
and they also offered him an internship .
one is that most of us probably do n't think about donating to research .
i know i did n't . i think i 'm a normal person .
but i did it .
and they need him in order to do their job .
and a life that once seemed brief and insignificant revealed itself to be vital , everlasting and relevant .
thank you .
so there are up to a million people there everyday .
here 's another story .
maybe you had a direct line .
i barely did it , because i found it boring and painful , and as a result , it took me another six weeks to get better .
both my mom and i required physical therapy , a process of doing a suite of repetitive exercises in order to regain the range of movement lost due to an accident or injury .
this means the majority of patients do n't do their exercises and therefore take a lot longer to get better .
my physical therapist has already set up a schedule for my particular therapy .
let 's see how this looks .
i control the bee by doing elbow extension and flexion , just like when i was seven years old after the cast was taken off .
we then make that a video game to give patients simple , motivating objectives to follow .
i feel more engaged and confident , as i 'm exercising alongside my therapist with the exercises my therapist thinks are best for me .
thank you .
it all began for him during world war ii , when at age 17 he found himself thrust into a forged documents workshop .
and it 's not a banal story — after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the '70s .
`` i had a `` '' normal '' '' dad like everybody else , apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ... ''
well , he was basically old enough to be my grandfather .
and , of course , he never talked about his past life when he was a forger .
in order to do that , i set out to forge their signature .
i started working on my mother 's signature , because my father 's is absolutely impossible to forge .
i went to hide in my bedroom , under the blankets , and then i waited for my father to come back from work with , one could say , much apprehension .
i remained under the blankets . he entered my room , sat on the corner of the bed , and he was silent , so i pulled the blanket from my head , and when he saw me he started laughing .
he was laughing so hard , he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand .
i was born in algeria .
`` there i would hear people say my father was a `` '' moudjahid '' '' and that means `` '' fighter . '' '' later on , in france , i loved eavesdropping on grownups ' conversations , and i would hear all sorts of stories about my father 's previous life , especially that he had `` '' done '' '' world war ii , that he had `` '' done '' '' the algerian war . ''
but knowing my father , and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent , i found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun .
these are real !
`` and then , suddenly , i went `` '' wow ! '' '' my father , a secret agent ? ''
it was very james bond .
i wanted to ask him questions , which he did n't answer .
and later , i told myself that one day i would have to question him .
i feared he 'd go and take his silences with him , and take his secrets with him .
i managed to convince him that it was important for us , but possibly also for other people that he shared his story .
he decided to tell it to me and i made a book , from which i 'm going to read you some excerpts later .
his parents were of russian descent .
the whole family came to settle in france in the '30s .
his parents were jewish , russian and above all , very poor .
and with his only diploma , his primary education certificate , he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner .
all day he would ask many questions to his boss to learn , to accumulate more and more knowledge , and at night , when no one was looking , he 'd put his experience to practice .
he was mostly interested in ink bleaching .
all this to tell you that if my father became a forger , actually , it was almost by accident .
finally they were all arrested and taken to the drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their argentinean papers .
`` well , they were out , but they were always in danger . the big `` '' jew '' '' stamp was still on their papers . ''
it was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .
in those times documents had hard covers , they were filled in by hand , and they stated your job .
`` and actually , without knowing it , my father had invented something we can find in every schoolchild 's pencil case : the so-called `` '' correction pen . '' '' ( applause ) but it was only the beginning . ''
that 's my father .
but demand was ever-growing and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents .
he told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch .
he started making rubber stamps .
this sense of responsibility for other people 's lives when he was just 17 — and also his guilt for being a survivor , since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not — stayed with him all his life .
there were obviously financial sacrifices because he always refused to be paid .
`` if he had accepted payment , he would n't be able to say `` '' yes '' '' or `` '' no '' '' depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause . ''
so he was a photographer by day , and a forger by night for 30 years .
how can one explain what one does at night in the lab , every single night ?
of course , there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that i understood much later .
one day my father introduced me to my sister .
he also explained to me that i had a brother , too , and the first time i saw them i must have been three or four , and they were 30 years older than me .
they are both in their sixties now .
she explained that the father that she 'd had would tell them he 'd come and pick them up on sunday to go for a walk .
and then he would not come .
then one day he totally disappeared .
time passed , and they thought he had surely forgotten them , at first .
in africa there were countries fighting for their independence : guinea , guinea-bissau , angola .
and then my father connected with nelson mandela 's anti-apartheid party .
he made false papers for persecuted black south africans .
there was also latin america .
then there was the vietnam war .
my father made false papers for the american deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the vietnamese .
europe was not spared either .
my father made false papers for the dissidents against franco in spain , salazar in portugal , against the colonels ' dictatorship in greece , and even in france .
my father watched , benevolently , of course , the demonstrations of the month of may , but his heart was elsewhere , and so was his time because he had over 15 countries to serve .
once , though , he agreed to make false papers for someone you might recognize .
he told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant and the least useful he 'd had to make in all his life .
all my childhood , while my friends ' dads would tell them grimm 's fairy tales , my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles .
and those heroes did not need an army behind them .
i understood much later that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep .
he said no .
i loved our neighborhood .
it was lively .
but it was n't simple .
i spent much of my childhood worried , worried about our safety .
and so did our mother .
but there were other novelties as well .
very quickly , i felt like i did n't belong .
it 's a kind of violence .
i have eternal imposter syndrome .
or , i am exceptional , which means i 've had to leave the people i love behind .
it 's the price that i and so many others pay for learning while black .
( applause ) it is possible to create emotionally and physically safe classrooms where students also thrive academically .
so what did that look like ?
well you can see where this is going .
i have a confession to make .
so think about it .
it 's a type of collaborative problem solving , usually among people who have different expertise and different points of view .
so when we look at why it is that pixar is able to do what it does , we have to ask ourselves , what 's going on here ?
pilots are often about being right .
so they selected that one .
at pixar , they understand that innovation takes a village .
`` bill said , `` '' i lead a volunteer organization . ''
they want to cocreate with me the future .
we 've studied many organizations that were really not organizations you 'd think of as ones where a lot of innovation happens .
because what was happening is that everybody was looking up and you were n't seeing the kind of bottom-up innovation we saw at pixar or google .
they began to transfer the organization 's growth to that level .
why do we cheat ?
and why do happy people cheat ?
`` and when we say `` '' infidelity , '' '' what exactly do we mean ? ''
is it a hookup , a love story , paid sex , a chat room , a massage with a happy ending ?
and yet , this extremely common act is so poorly understood .
but who knows what 's really going on under the sheets there , right ?
the fact is that monogamy had nothing to do with love .
but the definition of infidelity keeps on expanding : sexting , watching porn , staying secretly active on dating apps .
but now that marriage is a romantic arrangement , infidelity threatens our emotional security .
ironically , we used to turn to adultery — that was the space where we sought pure love .
`` and then another message : `` ca n't wait to hold you in my arms . '' ''
heather , she goes digging , and she finds hundreds of messages , and photos exchanged and desires expressed .
because of this romantic ideal , we are relying on our partner 's fidelity with a unique fervor .
and if the situation were reversed , nick would be in the same situation .
now , the typical assumption is that if someone cheats , either there 's something wrong in your relationship or wrong with you .
but millions of people ca n't all be pathological .
what if there are things that even a good relationship can never provide ?
if even happy people cheat , what is it about ?
affairs are an act of betrayal , and they are also an expression of longing and loss .
and with his truck and his tattoos , he 's quite the opposite of her .
and her story highlights for me that when we seek the gaze of another , it is n't always our partner that we are turning away from , but the person that we have ourselves become .
they feel alive .
death and mortality often live in the shadow of an affair , because they raise these questions .
desire runs deep .
they 'll be able to turn this into a generative experience .
so when an affair is exposed , what are some of the specific things that couples can do ?
and nick , he needs to hold vigil for the relationship .
but affairs are here to stay , and they 're not going away .
betrayal in a relationship comes in many forms .
sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner .
( laughter ) so , you 're wrong .
would you like to create a second one together ?
and we 've got such a long way to go with this .
it does n't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats .
the car seat 's moving all over the place .
yeah .
not especially responsible , not especially reciprocal and not especially enjoyable .
she shrugged .
`` `` '' i guess we girls are just socialized to be these docile creatures who do n't express our wants or needs . '' '' `` `` wait a minute , '' '' i replied . ''
she hemmed and hawed .
they are , however , engaging in other behavior .
young women have lots of reasons for participating .
sometimes , it was a way to get out of an uncomfortable situation .
`` 'you want me to uh ... ? ' '' '' you know , totally begrudging . ''
you would n't stand for it .
but it was n't always that boys did n't want to .
`` `` no one wants to be talked about like that . '' ''
that a girl 's most intimate part is open to public scrutiny , open to critique , to becoming more about how it looks to someone else than how it feels to her .
the shaving trend has sparked another rise in labiaplasty .
`` `` the barbie . '' ''
`` sara mcclellan , a psychologist at the university of michigan , coined what is my favorite phrase ever in talking about all of this : `` intimate justice . '' ''
intimate justice asks us to consider who is entitled to engage in an experience .
who is entitled to enjoy it ?
`` and how does each partner define `` '' good enough '' '' ? ''
so when young women report sexual satisfaction levels that are equal to or greater than young men 's — and they do in research — that can be deceptive .
but absence of pain — that 's a very low bar for your own sexual fulfillment .
it 's unrealistic .
here 's something , though .
and young women climax at the same rate as men .
`` so i asked a gay girl that i met , `` how 'd you know you were n't a virgin anymore ? '' ''
she finally decided that she was n't a virgin anymore after she 'd had her first orgasm with a partner .
and i thought — whoa .
the dutch girls embodied everything we say we want from our girls .
what was their secret ?
i want them to be able to revel in their bodies ' sensuality without being reduced to it .
it 's a lot to ask , but it 's not too much .
they 'll develop fixations like chasing their tails compulsively .
here 's an example of a cat named gizmo .
those are the things that often tend to help the most , especially when combined with psychopharmaceuticals .
five years ago , i had my dream job .
i was a foreign correspondent in the middle east reporting for abc news .
but by the time i got there , it was already nearly impossible to find stories about iraq on air .
afghanistan had already fallen off the agenda .
i saw the implications up front .
trust in the media has hit an all-time low .
but we can fix this .
it 's a choice .
news is adult education .
understanding complexity is the only way to know the real threats that are around the corner .
we all want to .
and they recapitulate that shape , even though that 's a circle of nine and that 's a circle of 36. it 's nuts .
( laughter ) and i 'm presenting it here at ted . why ?
one is that i 'm always on time , and i 'm not .
i was once late to my own speech on time management .
( laughter ) we all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony .
you know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise ?
do n't watch two hours of tv a day , right ?
we do n't build the lives we want by saving time .
here 's what i mean .
if you 've ever had anything like this happen to you , you know it is a hugely damaging , frightening , sopping mess .
`` `` could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people ? '' ''
and so the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater .
so of course this makes me even more intrigued , and when i finally do catch up with her , she explains it like this .
`` she says , `` '' listen laura , everything i do , every minute i spend , is my choice . '' '' and rather than say , `` i do n't have time to do x , y or z , '' she 'd say , `` '' i do n't do x , y or z because it 's not a priority . '' '' `` i do n't have time , '' often means `` it 's not a priority . '' ''
and granted , there may be horrible consequences for making different choices , i will give you that .
so how do we do that ?
the first , on the professional side : i 'm sure many people coming up to the end of the year are giving or getting annual performance reviews .
`` you look back over your successes over the year , your `` '' opportunities for growth . '' '' and this serves its purpose , but i find it 's more effective to do this looking forward . ''
so i want you to pretend it 's the end of next year .
you 're giving yourself a performance review , and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally .
so you can write next year 's performance review now .
i 'm sure many of you , like me , come december , get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper , on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter .
so this year 's kind of done , but i want you to pretend it 's the end of next year , and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you and the people you care about .
do n't send it .
but you can write it .
making a three-category list reminds us that there should be something in all three categories .
where you plan them in is up to you .
i mean , some people 's lives are just harder than others .
it is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class if you are caring for multiple children on your own .
you say you 're working 50 hours a week , maybe a main job and a side hustle .
well , are you sure ?
( laughter ) there was once a study comparing people 's estimated work weeks with time diaries .
( laughter ) you can guess in which direction , right ?
anyway , in 168 hours a week , i think we can find time for what matters to you .
and that 's even if you 're working way more than full-time hours .
so we have plenty of time , which is great , because guess what ?
we do n't even need that much time to do amazing things .
but when most of us have bits of time , what do we do ?
start deleting emails .
otherwise , we 're puttering around the house or watching tv .
but small moments can have great power .
breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying .
if family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule , maybe family breakfast could be a good substitute .
there is time .
even if we are busy , we have time for what matters .
( applause )
we are n't functioning so easily anymore .
i ca n't draw .
and it 's called music .
this is a project i did for the sundance film festival .
and so i repurposed this code to train a system on one person in our culture who would never need to be surveilled in that manner , which is britney spears .
but it does n't really tell us who we are .
and i started looking for a corpus of data that had a lot of descriptions written by ordinary americans .
and i looked at word analysis .
it reduces people to numbers .
that 's 17,000 a day , and i have them all .
jane fonda : yes we have .
which is a feel-good , calming , stress-reducing hormone .
and i do think that 's one reason why we live longer .
there 's actually kind of a love , an element of love in the relationship .
jf : well , there 's all kinds of friends .
they 're revelatory .
`` i mean how many times have i asked you , `` '' am i doing ok ? '' '' `` did i really screw up there ? '' ''
pm : you 're doing great .
they do n't ask for help .
and that 's really important .
lt : well , that 's what 's exciting about this subject .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple .
we do n't want iran to get the bomb .
the gray boxes that you see , these are real-time control systems .
now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
the gray boxes do n't run windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
but if we manage to place a good windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box , then we are in business .
and this is the plot behind stuxnet .
so we start with a windows dropper .
the payload goes onto the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the iranian nuclear program is delayed — mission accomplished .
that 's easy , huh ?
when we started our research on stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
the only thing that was known is it 's very , very complex on the windows part , the dropper part , used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities .
did n't make sense to me .
the dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it 's trying to infect is actually running on that target .
`` so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , `` '' well , we do n't know what the target is . ''
it could be , let 's say for example , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
`` so we better find out what the target is soon . '' '' so we extracted and decompiled the attack code , and we discovered that it 's structured in two digital bombs — a smaller one and a bigger one . ''
and we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information .
they probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
and if you have heard that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you this : the payload is rocket science .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
looks pretty much like old-style assembly language .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world — to potential real world targets .
so we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove .
in order to get target theories , we remember that it 's definitely hardcore sabotage , it must be a high-value target and it is most likely located in iran , because that 's where most of the infections had been reported .
now you do n't find several thousand targets in that area .
it basically boils down to the bushehr nuclear power plant and to the natanz fuel enrichment plant .
`` so i told my assistant , `` get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base . '' ''
and i phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data .
the rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge , that black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy — obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
the big digital warhead — we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
so for example , the number 164 really stands out in that code ; you ca n't overlook it .
and it even got better .
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a real good match .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
now do n't get me wrong here , it did n't go like this .
these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target , but from different angles .
it is natanz , and it is only natanz .
so we do n't have to worry that other targets might be hit by stuxnet .
here 's some very cool stuff that we saw — really knocked my socks off .
now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors — so for example , from pressure sensors and vibration sensors — and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
and as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually prerecorded by stuxnet .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .
obviously , this can not be done by a human operator .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
your plant can blow up .
but it gets worse .
it does n't have anything to do , in specifics , with centrifuges , with uranium enrichment .
it is generic .
and you do n't have — as an attacker — you do n't have to deliver this payload by a usb stick , as we saw it in the case of stuxnet .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
that 's the consequence that we have to face .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the middle east .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
( applause ) chris anderson : i 've got a question .
ralph , it 's been quite widely reported that people assume that mossad is the main entity behind this .
is that your opinion ?
ralph langner : okay , you really want to hear that ?
yeah . okay .
so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
ca : thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us . thank you , ralph .
( applause )
isabel wijsen : a green paradise .
mw : or ...
iw : so we decided to do something about it .
but that is a huge problem .
and you know what ?
our first attempts to get the government of bali on board failed .
mw : but how do we get into the airport ?
off we headed to the airport .
iw : but last year , we did exactly that .
iw : so to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world : go for it !
but that 's not all , because superconductors do n't like magnetic fields .
so , this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking .
we have frictionless motion . it is still levitating , but can move freely all around .
and that was the very first time that i found an opportunity to feel that i was able to express my own voice , and that 's what 's fueled me , then , to become a choreographer .
i feel like i 've got something to say and something to share .
i think it 's the most technologically literate thing that we have , and i 'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way of communicating ideas through the body to audiences that might move them , touch them , help them think differently about things .
so for me , choreography is very much a process of physical thinking . it 's very much in mind , as well as in body , and it 's a collaborative process .
it 's something that i have to do with other people .
you know , it 's a distributed cognitive process in a way .
yeah , you all have a body , right ?
so , we all understand what it feels like to know where the ends of your fingers are when you hold out your arms , yeah ?
we just do n't think about our bodies very much .
but how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking , kinesthetic intelligence , to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally ?
i 'll just be doing it .
i want to introduce you . this is paolo . this is catarina .
( applause ) they have no idea what we 're going to do .
but what 's important about it is how it is that they 're grasping information , how they 're taking information , how they 're using it , and how they 're thinking with it .
i 'm going to start really , really simply .
usually , dance has a stimulus or stimuli , and i thought i 'd take something simple , ted logo , we can all see it , it 's quite easy to work with , and i 'm going to do something very simply , where you take one idea from a body , and it happens to be my body , and translate that into somebody else 's body , so it 's a direct transfer , transformation of energy .
i can absolutely walk around it when i see it , yeah ?
it has a kind of a grammar . i know what i 'm going to do with it , and i can start to describe it , so i can describe it very simply . i can describe it in my arms , right ?
so all i did was take my hand and then i move my hand .
i can describe it , whoa , in my head , you know ? whoa .
`` if i were to take that letter `` '' t '' '' and flatten it down on the floor , here , maybe just off the floor , all of a sudden i could do maybe something with my knee , yeah ? whoa . so if i put the knee and the arms together , i 've got something physical , yeah ? and i can start to build something . ''
so what i 'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so is i 'm going to take that concept , i 'm going to make something , and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it , they 're going to snapshot it , they 're going to take aspects of it , and it 's almost like i 'm offloading memory and they 're holding onto memory ? yeah ?
and we 'll see what we come up with .
`` so just have a little watch about how they 're , how they 're accessing this and what they 're doing , and i 'm just going to take this letter `` '' t , '' '' the letter `` '' e , '' '' and the letter `` '' d , '' '' to make something . okay . here goes . ''
`` i 'm just working on my task . my task is this `` '' t. '' '' going to watch it from the side , whoa . ''
strike moment .
that 's it .
so what they 're doing , let 's see , something like that , so what they 're doing is grasping aspects of that movement and they 're generating it into a phrase .
i 'm not asking them to copy exactly .
i can watch that and that can tell me something about how it is that they 're moving .
yeah , they 're super quick , right ?
so i 've taken this aspect of ted and translated it into something that 's physical .
some dancers , when they 're watching action , take the overall shape , the arc of the movement , the kinetic sense of the movement , and use that for memory .
okay . from there i 'm going to do a very different thing .
so basically i 'm going to make a duet .
i want you to think about them as architectural objects , so what they are , are just pure lines .
they 're no longer people , just pure lines , and i 'm going to work with them almost as objects to think with , yeah ?
so what i 'm thinking about is taking a few physical extensions from the body as i move , and i move them , and i do that by suggesting things to them : if , then ; if , then . okay , so here we go .
just grab this arm .
yeah , down to the floor . can you go underneath ?
can you rotate ?
whoa , underneath , whoo-um . yeah ? underneath . jump .
kick , replace , change a leg . kick , replace , change the leg .
whoaa . just after it , maybe . whoaa , whaaay , ooh .
okay , let 's have a little go from the beginning of that .
yeah . just a little bit more , here we go , from that place .
separate . face the front . separate . face the front .
kick it out of the way . throw it into the audience . whoom .
let me just see that a little bit . ready , and go .
( clicks metronome ) okay , brilliant . okay , here we go . from the beginning , can we do our phrases first ? and then that .
ready and go ... um . ( clicks metronome ) ( clicks metronome ) the duet starts . ( clicks metronome ) ( clicks metronome ) so yeah , okay , good . okay , nice , very nice . ( applause ) so good . so — ( applause ) okay . so that was — ( applause ) well done . ( applause ) that was the second way of working .
the first one , body-to-body transfer , yeah , with an outside mental architecture that i work with that they hold memory with for me .
`` the second one , which is using them as objects to think with their architectural objects , i do a series of provocations , i say , `` '' if this happens , then that . ''
`` if this , if that happens — `` '' i 've got lots of methods like that , but it 's very , very quick , and this is a third method . ''
so i 'd like us just to do , we 're going to do a little mental dance , a little , in this little one minute , so what i 'd love you to do is imagine , you can do this with your eyes closed , or open , and if you do n't want to do it you can watch them , it 's up to you .
what i 'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it .
`` i 'm going to zone in on the `` '' e , '' '' and i 'm going to scale that `` '' e '' '' so it 's absolutely massive , so i 'm scaling that `` '' e '' '' so it 's absolutely massive , and then i 'm going to give it dimensionality . ''
i 'm going to think about it in 3d space . so now , instead of it just being a letter that 's in front of me , it 's a space that my body can go inside of .
if you reach with your elbow , where would it be ?
`` if i already then said about that space that you 're in , let 's infuse it with the color red , what does that do to the body ? if i then said to you , what happens if that whole wall on the side of `` '' e '' '' collapses and you have to use your weight to put it back up , what would you be able to do with it ? ''
so they 've been working on those mental architectures in the here .
i know , i think we should keep them as a surprise .
so here goes , world premiere dance . yeah ? here we go .
so , you 're going to do the first solo that we made , yeah blah blah blah blah , we go into the duet , yeah , blah blah blah blah . the next solo , blah blah blah blah , yeah , and both at the same time , you do the last solutions .
okay ? okay . ladies and gentlemen , world premiere , ted dance , three versions of physical thinking . ( applause ) well , clap afterwards , let 's see if it 's any good , yeah ? ( laughter ) so yeah , let 's clap — yeah , let 's clap afterwards .
here we go . catarina , big moment , here we go , one .
the one you made . ( clicks metronome ) ( clicks metronome ) well done . okay , good . super . so — ( applause ) so — ( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) so — three versions . ( applause ) oh . ( laughs ) ( applause ) three versions of physical thinking , yeah ?
three versions of physical thinking . i 'm hoping that today , what you 're going to do is go away and make a dance for yourself , and if not that , at least misbehave more beautifully , more often .
thank you very much . ( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause ) here we go . ( applause ) ( applause )
so when the moist breeze blows in off the sea , you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle 's shell .
( applause )
i want to start by doing an experiment .
i 'm going to play three videos of a rainy day .
so i want you think carefully which one the clip with the bacon is .
actually , i lied .
all of the sounds you hear are fake .
so let 's reverse-engineer together the creation of a sound effect .
so here 's what the underwater mic sounds like .
( water splashes ) and pitched it down another octave .
but once you 've created your sounds and you 've synced them to the image , you want those sounds to live in the world of the story .
and one the best ways to do that is to add reverb .
so this is the first audio tool i want to talk about .
( gunshot ) by adding reverb , we can make it sound like it was recorded inside a bathroom .
( gunshot reverbs church ) or in a canyon .
or , even more powerful in film , morgan freeman .
well , here 's a really big one .
but what does silence mean ?
but i want to make it clear : there is no such thing as silence .
but even if you were to enter a room with zero reverberation and zero external sounds , you would still be able to hear the pumping of your own blood .
there 's always some sort of noise .
( thunder ) church bells can remind us of the passing of time , or perhaps our own mortality .
( brass and wind instruments play ) so now we 've spoken about on-screen sounds .
but occasionally , the source of a sound can not be seen .
`` that 's what we call offscreen sounds , or `` '' acousmatic . '' '' acousmatic sounds — well , the term `` '' acousmatic '' '' comes from pythagoras in ancient greece , who used to teach behind a veil or curtain for years , not revealing himself to his disciples . ''
there 's a strong tradition of acousmatic sound .
richard wagner famously created the hidden orchestra that was placed in a pit between the stage and the audience .
so what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
but then the second group is even more interesting .
but novelty is n't about new positions .
now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology — think google maps , think gps — the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation .
so let 's take a look at the brain .
this is the blood vessels .
20 percent of the oxygen coming from your lungs , 20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart , is servicing this one organ .
that 's basically , if you hold two fists together , it 's just slightly larger than the two fists .
scientists , sort of at the end of the 20th century , learned that they could track blood flow to map non-invasively where activity was going on in the human brain .
so for example , they can see in the back part of the brain , which is just turning around there .
there 's the cerebellum ; that 's keeping you upright right now .
towards the front of the brain is the place in which all of the more complex thought , decision making — it 's the last to mature in late adulthood .
this is where all your decision-making processes are going on .
you can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained .
so the outer part of that brain is the neocortex .
and all of these blank areas are the areas in which the wires are running through .
let 's look at neurons .
these are support cells — astrocytes glia .
and the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input .
they 're storing it , they 're processing it .
and each neuron itself is largely unique .
they 're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement .
and they 're controlling basically everything that the nervous system has to do .
so if we zoom in to an even deeper level , all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes .
so we sent our lab technician out .
we were seeking normal human brains .
we are seeking normal human brains .
there 's a lot of criteria by which we 're selecting these brains .
we want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60 , they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain , no history of psychiatric disease , no drugs on board — we do a toxicology workup .
we 're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue , we can get consent to take the tissue within 24 hours of time of death .
one side note on the collection of brains : because of the way that we collect , and because we require consent , we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains .
this is magnetic resonance imaging — mri .
so we collect this mr .
and again , you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways , if you will .
the brain is removed from the skull , and then it 's sliced into one-centimeter slices .
and those are frozen solid , and they 're shipped to seattle .
and then what we get is our first mapping .
you could consider this state boundaries , if you will , those pretty broad outlines .
and so you can see here , old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied .
so again this is what they can see under the microscope .
you can see collections and configurations of large and small cells in clusters and various places .
and from there it 's routine . they understand where to make these assignments .
our scientists then use this to go back to another piece of that tissue and do what 's called laser scanning microdissection .
so the technician takes the instructions .
there 's a container underneath that 's collecting that tissue .
now this may look like a bunch of dots to you , but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass .
this has roughly 60,000 elements on it , so we repeatedly measure various genes of the 25,000 genes in the genome .
and when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it , we get a unique fingerprint , if you will , quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample .
now we do this over and over again , this process for any given brain .
we 're taking over a thousand samples for each brain .
it 's involved in learning and memory .
and it contributes to about 70 samples of those thousand samples .
so each sample gets us about 50,000 data points with repeat measurements , a thousand samples .
so roughly , we have 50 million data points for a given human brain .
it 's basically a large data set of information that 's all freely available to any scientist around the world .
they do n't even have to log in to come use this tool , mine this data , find interesting things out with this .
so here 's the modalities that we put together .
you 'll start to recognize these things from what we 've collected before .
here 's the mr. it provides the framework .
there 's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn , it allows you to zoom in , it allows you to highlight individual structures .
but most importantly , we 're now mapping into this anatomic framework , which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on .
and each gene gives us a fingerprint .
and remember that we 've assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome and have all of that data available .
two great examples are drugs , prozac and wellbutrin .
these are commonly prescribed antidepressants .
now remember , we 're assaying genes .
so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off , etc .
so if you want to understand the action of drugs , you want to understand how they 're acting in the ways you want them to , and also in the ways you do n't want them to .
in the side effect profile , etc. , you want to see where those genes are turned on .
and for the first time , we can actually do that .
we can do that in multiple individuals that we 've assayed too .
so now we can look throughout the brain .
and we get confirmation .
we get confirmation that , indeed , the gene is turned on — for something like prozac , in serotonergic structures , things that are already known be affected — but we also get to see the whole thing .
we also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before , and we see these genes turned on there .
it 's as interesting a side effect as it could be .
`` most of you are probably familiar with genome-wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying , `` '' scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect x . '' '' and so these kinds of studies are routinely published by scientists and they 're great . they analyze large populations . ''
they look at their entire genomes , and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked causally to genes .
it tells you the what , but it does n't tell you the where .
now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity .
but the fact is our genomes are greater than 99 percent similar .
we 're similar at the genetic level .
and those genes are interesting , but they 're very subtle .
so i think it 's an important message to take home today that even though we celebrate all of our differences , we are quite similar even at the brain level .
these are two genes that we found as good examples .
one is called reln — it 's involved in early developmental cues .
and so what you 're looking at here in donor one and donor four , which are the exceptions to the other two , that genes are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells .
it 's this dark purple precipitate within the cell that 's telling us a gene is turned on there .
those kinds of studies require much larger populations .
so i 'm going to leave you with a final note about the complexity of the brain and how much more we have to go .
i think these resources are incredibly valuable .
but we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point .
we 're certainly going to be looking at more .
i 'll just close by saying that the tools are there , and this is truly an unexplored , undiscovered continent .
this is the new frontier , if you will .
thanks .
i 'm here today to talk about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing answer .
my topic is the secrets of domestic violence , and the question i 'm going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks : why does she stay ?
i 'm not a psychiatrist , a social worker or an expert in domestic violence .
i had moved to new york city for my first job as a writer and editor at seventeen magazine .
i had my first apartment , my first little green american express card , and i had a very big secret .
my secret was that i had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who i thought was my soulmate , many , many times .
the man who i loved more than anybody on earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than i can even remember .
i do n't look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
i have a b.a . in english from harvard college , an mba in marketing from wharton business school .
my dog is a black lab , and i drive a honda odyssey minivan .
and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it 's a women 's issue .
over 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
i would have told you myself that i was the last person on earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact i was a very typical victim because of my age .
i was 22 , and in the united states , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the united states .
i was also a very typical victim because i knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns .
i met conor on a cold , rainy january night .
he did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
conor believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
and he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he 'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
which is why that ivy league degree and the wall street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him .
if you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where i lived , what jobs i took , who my friends were and where i spent christmas , i would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in conor at the beginning .
i also did n't know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
because i had made him feel so safe and loved that he did n't need to prove himself on wall street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in new england where he could start his life over with me by his side .
now , the last thing i wanted to do was leave new york , and my dream job , but i thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate , so i agreed , and i quit my job , and conor and i left manhattan together .
he kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
and he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he 'd experienced as a young boy .
he needed them to feel protected .
but those guns were really a message for me , and even though he had n't raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day .
conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
i was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and i got frustrated , and conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that i could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and i put on my mother 's wedding dress , and i married him .
and he was very , very sorry .
he had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
it happened twice more on the honeymoon .
the first time , i was driving to find a secret beach and i got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver 's side window .
conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
i was mistaken in thinking that i was unique and alone in this situation .
the answer is easy .
i did n't know he was abusing me .
even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as i drove down the highway , poured coffee grinds on my head as i dressed for a job interview , i never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
the other question everybody asks is , why does n't she just leave ?
because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship , after she 's gotten out , because then the abuser has nothing left to lose .
other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
and still we ask , why does n't she just leave ?
i was able to leave , because of one final , sadistic beating that broke through my denial .
i realized that the man who i loved so much was going to kill me if i let him .
so i broke the silence .
i told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and i 'm here today because you all helped me .
we tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods .
`` but since publishing `` '' crazy love , '' '' i have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives — joyous , happy lives — as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me . ''
because it turns out that i 'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
i have that black lab , and i have that minivan .
what i will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me .
`` right now , maybe you 're thinking , `` wow , this is fascinating , '' or , `` '' wow , how stupid was she , '' '' but this whole time , i 've actually been talking about you . ''
abuse could be affecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
i 'm still breaking the silence today .
talk about what you heard here .
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family .
recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene , deescalate it , show victims a safe way out .
thank you .
( applause )
so that 's what those great meditators have been doing .
we love to do jogging , fitness .
just this one example is worth a lot of work .
it 's easy to forget that last night , one billion people went to sleep without access to electricity .
one billion people .
but even in our own world , the developed world , we see the tension of stagnant economies impacting the lives of people around us .
as we as a society figure out how to manage the problems of the developed world and the problems of the developing world , we have to look at how we move forward and manage the environmental impact of those decisions .
our most recent move is the paris treaty , and the resulting climate agreements that are being ratified by nations around the world .
the unfortunate thing is that now , as we look at the independent analyses of what those climate treaties are liable to yield , the magnitude of the problem before us becomes clear .
it shows basically co2 emissions around the world over the next 30 years .
there are three things that you need to look at and appreciate .
the second thing you should notice is that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries , from china , from india , from the rest of the world , which includes south africa and indonesia and brazil , as most of these countries move their people into the lower range of lifestyles that we literally take for granted in the developed world .
it 's a function of the development path that they 've followed as a society .
it 's a function of where on the surface of the planet they are .
many , many , many things go into the choices of countries , and they each make a different choice .
the overwhelming thing that we need to appreciate is the choice that china has made .
the united states has an alternative .
eastern europe , still very heavily committed to natural gas and to coal , and with natural gas that comes from russia , with all of its entanglements .
china has many fewer choices and a much harder row to hoe .
it urbanized .
it urbanized by taking low-cost labor and low-cost energy , creating export industries that could fund a tremendous amount of growth .
if we look at china 's path , all of us know that prosperity in china has dramatically increased .
but the impact of all that wealth allowed people to get massively better nutrition .
but in 1980 , and even today , the number one killer in china is indoor air pollution , because people do not have access to clean cooking and heating fuels .
it 's not because they do n't know the alternatives ; it 's because rich countries can do what they choose , poor countries do what they must .
what can we do that changes this forecast that 's in front of us ?
`` it had to stand on its own two feet ; it could not be maintained for that many people if in fact , those countries had to go begging or had some foreign country say , `` '' i wo n't trade with you , '' '' in order to get the technology shift to occur . ''
that 's what the eia forecast tells us .
china 's building 800 gigawatts of coal , 400 gigawatts of hydro , about 200 gigawatts of nuclear , and on an energy-equivalent basis , adjusting for intermittency , about 100 gigawatts of renewables .
if you look at all the alternatives that are out there , there are really two that come near to meeting it .
first is this area of new nuclear that i 'll talk about in just a second .
right now , we 're basically waiting for a miracle .
this species , when you cut the bark , you find a very dark red resin that was very good to paint and dye fabric to make clothes .
`` the indigenous people called this species pau brasil , and that 's the reason why this land became `` '' land of brasil , '' '' and later on , brazil . ''
apart from all those products , the forest is very important for climate regulation .
in brazil , almost 70 percent of the evaporation that makes rain actually comes from the forest .
that 's the good news .
and of those , eight million were indigenous lands .
but it 's interesting to know that it 's quite the opposite .
maybe this is completely disconnected , as we just learned by having deforestation come down .
it 's more or less like we are forest heroes , but still deforestation champions .
so we ca n't be satisfied , not even close to satisfied .
i went to visit canada , in british columbia , together with the chiefs of the forest services of other countries that we have a kind of alliance of them , like canada , russia , india , china , u.s .
i will not get into that now .
so 11 billion tons is twice that .
now it 's a little bit less than 30 percent .
so if we can tackle directly the energy , the same way we could tackle deforestation , maybe we can have a chance .
i mean , it 's a person who sort of missed fitting in .
or a person who fits in badly .
i 'm going to tell you a misfit story .
somewhere in my early 30s , the dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep .
the prize was a trip to new york city to meet big-time editors and agents and other authors .
you know what i did the day the letter came to my house ?
i was thinking about all the ways i 'd already screwed my life up .
i was a misfit .
and i 'd had two lovely staycations in jail .
you know , homeless people are some of our most heroic misfits , because they start out as us .
so you see , i 'd missed fitting in to just about every category out there : daughter , wife , mother , scholar .
audience : how fancy ?
and i shoved a menu down my pants .
carole maso wrote the book that later became my art bible .
farrar , straus and giroux was like my mega-dream press .
but that did n't happen .
i mean , that 's how big a deal it was to me .
on the last night , i gave a big reading at the national poetry club .
i stood there and i kind of went deaf .
misfit people — we do n't always know how to hope or say yes or choose the big thing , even when it 's right in front of us .
it 's a shame we carry .
it 's the shame of not really believing we deserve to be in the room with the people we admire .
and yet , at home in the dark , back in my underwear , i could still hear their voices .
and i 'm a writer .
and i 'm a mother .
there 's a myth in most cultures about following your dreams .
it 's called the misfit 's myth .
that 's your beauty .
thank you .
i had very low , no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
sure . it 's the computer .
but 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs .
this is joyce who 's — in this picture — 21 .
we do n't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
and here is a surprise .
that does not hold for emotions .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
come talk to me about it , i 'll fill in some of the details if you want .
now , here 's a piece of chalk .
the oil will never run out .
thank you very much .
what can we do to the mosquito ?
they 're the only ones that are dangerous .
so , that 's what i have . thanks very much .
there is an ancient proverb that says it 's very difficult to find a black cat in a dark room , especially when there is no cat .
now i know this is different than the way most people think about science .
science , we generally are told , is a very well-ordered mechanism for understanding the world , for gaining facts , for gaining data , that it 's rule-based , that scientists use this thing called the scientific method and we 've been doing this for 14 generations or so now , and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard , cold facts out of the data .
i 'd like to tell you that 's not the case .
so there 's the scientific method , but what 's really going on is this . ( laughter ) [ the scientific method vs. farting around ] and it 's going on kind of like that .
so this difference first came to me in some ways in my dual role at columbia university , where i 'm both a professor and run a laboratory in neuroscience where we try to figure out how the brain works .
but at the same time , it 's my responsibility to teach a large course to undergraduates on the brain , and that 's a big subject , and it takes quite a while to organize that , and it 's quite challenging and it 's quite interesting , but i have to say , it 's not so exhilarating .
`` well , the course i was and am teaching is called cellular and molecular neuroscience - i . ( laughs ) it 's 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts , it uses this giant book called `` '' principles of neural science '' '' by three famous neuroscientists . ''
just to put that in some perspective , that 's the weight of two normal human brains .
when i go to a meeting , after the meeting day is over and we collect in the bar over a couple of beers with my colleagues , we never talk about what we know .
we talk about what we do n't know .
we talk about what still has to get done , what 's so critical to get done in the lab .
indeed , this was , i think , best said by marie curie who said that one never notices what has been done but only what remains to be done .
this was in a letter to her brother after obtaining her second graduate degree , i should say .
i have to point out this has always been one of my favorite pictures of marie curie , because i am convinced that that glow behind her is not a photographic effect . ( laughter ) that 's the real thing .
this is the stuff that 's exhilarating and interesting .
it is , if you will , the ignorance .
so i thought , well , maybe i should teach a course on ignorance , something i can finally excel at , perhaps , for example .
so i did start teaching this course on ignorance , and it 's been quite interesting and i 'd like to tell you to go to the website .
you can find all sorts of information there . it 's wide open .
and it 's been really quite an interesting time for me to meet up with other scientists who come in and talk about what it is they do n't know .
`` now i use this word `` '' ignorance , '' '' of course , to be at least in part intentionally provocative , because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and i clearly do n't mean any of those . ''
so i do n't mean stupidity , i do n't mean a callow indifference to fact or reason or data .
the ignorant are clearly unenlightened , unaware , uninformed , and present company today excepted , often occupy elected offices , it seems to me .
`` i mean a kind of ignorance that 's less pejorative , a kind of ignorance that comes from a communal gap in our knowledge , something that 's just not there to be known or is n't known well enough yet or we ca n't make predictions from , the kind of ignorance that 's maybe best summed up in a statement by james clerk maxwell , perhaps the greatest physicist between newton and einstein , who said , `` '' thoroughly conscious ignorance is the prelude to every real advance in science . '' '' i think it 's a wonderful idea : thoroughly conscious ignorance . ''
so that 's the kind of ignorance that i want to talk about today , but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts ?
we all have this sense that science is this mountain of facts , this accumulation model of science , as many have called it , and it seems impregnable , it seems impossible .
and indeed , the scientific literature grows at an alarming rate .
in 2006 , there were 1.3 million papers published .
so i 've been up here a little over 10 minutes , i 've already lost three papers .
so what do we do about this ? well , the fact is that what scientists do about it is a kind of a controlled neglect , if you will .
we just do n't worry about it , in a way .
but knowing a lot of stuff does n't make you a scientist .
knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get to more ignorance .
so this leads us to maybe think about , a little bit about , some of the models of science that we tend to use , and i 'd like to disabuse you of some of them .
we do n't have any such guarantee .
( laughter ) so i think the puzzle model does n't work .
we can chip away at this iceberg and figure out what it is , or we could just wait for it to melt , i suppose , these days , but one way or another we could get to the whole iceberg . right ?
so the knowledge generates ignorance .
this is really well said , i thought , by george bernard shaw .
`` this is actually part of a toast that he delivered to celebrate einstein at a dinner celebrating einstein 's work , in which he claims that science just creates more questions than it answers . [ `` '' science is always wrong . it never solves a problem without creating 10 more . '' '' ] i find that kind of glorious , and i think he 's precisely right , plus it 's a kind of job security . ''
`` i love that term , `` '' question propagation , '' '' this idea of questions propagating out there . ''
so i 'd say the model we want to take is not that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together and then we gain knowledge .
what are we using this collection of facts for ?
sometimes we call them bull sessions .
but nonetheless , it 's what the argument is about .
it 's the ignorance . it 's the what we do n't know .
so let 's put a point on the graph . there 's an undergraduate .
now you look at a master 's student , a little further along in their education , and you see they know a bit more , but it 's been narrowed somewhat .
and finally you get your ph.d. , where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing . ( laughter ) what 's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that because , of course , when it dips below the zero axis , there , it gets into a negative area .
let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions .
i 'm a neuroscientist , so how would we come up with a question in neuroscience ?
so , for example , we could say , well what is it that the brain does ?
well , one thing the brain does , it moves us around .
so that maybe is not that interesting .
so instead maybe we want to choose something a little more complicated to look at .
how about the visual system ?
there it is , the visual system .
i mean , we love our visual systems . we do all kinds of cool stuff .
indeed , there are over 12,000 neuroscientists who work on the visual system , from the retina to the visual cortex , in an attempt to understand not just the visual system but to also understand how general principles of how the brain might work .
but now here 's the thing : our technology has actually been pretty good at replicating what the visual system does .
they work differently than our visual systems in some cases , but nonetheless we 've been pretty good at making a technology work like our visual system .
turn around , and they fall over . it 's a serious problem .
but here 's a diagram of five molecules and sort of a chemical notation .
if there 's a real rose there , those molecules will be the ones , but even if there 's no rose there , you 'll have the memory of a molecule .
it might be easier to visualize them this way , so the gray circles are carbon atoms , the white ones are hydrogen atoms and the red ones are oxygen atoms .
so there are two really interesting questions here , it seems to me .
one is , how can a simple little molecule like that create a perception in your brain that 's so clear as a pear or a banana ?
i like to quote because i think dead people should n't be excluded from the conversation .
and i also think it 's important to realize that the conversation 's been going on for a while , by the way .
`` so erwin schrodinger , a great quantum physicist and , i think , philosopher , points out how you have to `` '' abide by ignorance for an indefinite period '' '' of time . ''
and it 's this abiding by ignorance that i think we have to learn how to do .
i guess it comes down to our education system , so i 'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education , because i think that 's where it really has to play out .
so for one , let 's face it , in the age of google and wikipedia , the business model of the university and probably secondary schools is simply going to have to change .
so what do we have to do ? we have to give our students a taste for the boundaries , for what 's outside that circumference , for what 's outside the facts , what 's just beyond the facts .
so we have this remarkably efficient system for beating any interest in science out of everybody 's head .
geneticists always say , you always get what you screen for .
evaluation is one thing . you hear a lot about evaluation in the literature these days , in the educational literature , but evaluation really amounts to feedback and it amounts to an opportunity for trial and error .
`` so i 'd say what we need is a test that says , `` '' what is x ? '' '' and the answers are `` '' i do n't know , because no one does , '' '' or `` '' what 's the question ? '' '' even better . ''
`` and maybe for the advanced placement classes , it could be , `` '' here 's the answer . what 's the next question ? '' '' that 's the one i like in particular . ''
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
let me tell you , this is not a tapir .
and then next we have to provide training , capacity building .
i am swimming against the tide .
we have to find ways to solve all these problems .
and also start with a little bit of statistics .
think about that number : 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries .
you know , sunday morning , you flick the paper , get your cappuccino .
enjoy it while it lasts .
my story starts — the story i want to share — starts in 1991 .
it was still 1991 .
actually , i underestimated the atrocities , i have to admit .
first independent newspaper in slovakia .
they come to us with a request for a loan .
we were the best that they could do .
we started our media lab , sounds like a real great story .
it 's actually just a drop in the sea .
and it 's why it was invented .
thank you .
all knowledge of the english language and the english alphabet has been lost .
this is no hypothetical question .
in fact , what archeologists have found is none of that .
well obviously this is a replica .
a priest ?
but the indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them .
in fact , the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people .
which of these hypotheses can be true ?
here 's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences .
my students said that i should really seriously consider getting some protection .
what other evidence is there that the script could actually encode language ?
and what seems to have happened here is that the indus traders , the merchants , were using this script to write a foreign language .
so as an example , here 's a word .
got it ?
so that was pretty exciting .
it looks like we 're getting somewhere .
so you might ask , why did we design this robot ?
and my goal is to understand how this works .
there are four main components behind animal locomotion .
a third component are central pattern generators .
and here we want to start simple .
why not have a real robot and real physics ?
so among all these animals , one of my favorites is the salamander .
and in fact , the same has been observed in cats .
but even better , we can do swimming .
i was there covering the 25th anniversary of the world 's worst nuclear accident , as you can see by the look on my face , reluctantly so , but with good reason , because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation as the bomb dropped on hiroshima , and the sarcophagus , which is the covering over reactor number four , which was hastily built 27 years ago , now sits cracked and rusted and leaking radiation .
so i was filming .
i just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast .
but then , i looked into the distance , and i saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse , and i 'm thinking , who could be living here ?
you have to have dosimeter at all times , clicking away , you have to have a government minder , and there 's draconian radiation rules and constant contamination monitoring .
the point being , no human being should be living anywhere near the dead zone .
but they are .
it turns out an unlikely community of some 200 people are living inside the zone .
the women in the zone , now in their 70s and 80s , are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and , it would seem , common sense , and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone .
they did so illegally .
`` otherwise , i 'm going home . '' '' now why would they return to such deadly soil ? ''
i mean , were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them , or both ?
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently .
another village might have six or seven residents .
she 's the self-declared mayor of kapavati village , population eight .
stalin 's enforced famines of the 1930s , the holodomor , killed millions of ukrainians , and they faced the nazis in the '40s , who came through slashing , burning , raping , and in fact many of these women were shipped to germany as forced labor .
so when a couple decades into soviet rule , chernobyl happened , they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy that was invisible .
wild boar , lynx , moose , they 've all returned to the region in force , the very real , very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans .
the dead zone , it turns out , is full of life .
pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes , their only company a bit of homemade moonshine vodka .
and there 's a patina of simple defiance among them .
`` `` they told us our legs would hurt , and they do . so what ? '' ''
it 's incredibly difficult to parse .
health studies from the region are conflicting and fraught .
the world health organization puts the number of chernobyl-related deaths at 4,000 , eventually .
home is a transient concept .
so it 's hard for us to understand , but home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka , and connection to the land is palpable .
and perhaps because these ukrainian women were schooled under the soviets and versed in the russian poets , aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time .
`` `` '' those who left are worse off now . ''
what sounds like faith , soft faith , may actually be fact , because the surprising truth — i mean , there are no studies , but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on earth for the last 27 years , have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation , by some estimates up to 10 years .
how could this be ?
home and community are forces that rival even radiation .
but the spirit and existence of the babushkas , whose numbers have been halved in the three years i 've known them , will leave us with powerful new templates to think about and grapple with , about the relative nature of risk , about transformative connections to home , and about the magnificent tonic of personal agency and self-determination .
isadora was famous somewhere around 1908 for putting up a blue curtain , and she would stand with her hands over her solar plexus and she would wait , and she would wait , and then , she would move .
this is a morning in vancouver in 2015 .
are we there yet ?
where are we ?
josh .
this subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book , which compares traditional , small , tribal societies with our large , modern societies , with respect to many topics such as bringing up children , growing older , health , dealing with danger , settling disputes , religion and speaking more than one language .
tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society .
they constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn .
tribal societies should n't be scorned as primitive and miserable , but also they should n't be romanticized as happy and peaceful .
when we learn of tribal practices , some of them will horrify us , but there are other tribal practices which , when we hear about them , we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves .
it happens mainly under two conditions .
to us americans , it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father , but what could those traditional societies do differently ?
they face a cruel situation of no choice .
their old people had to do it to their own parents , and the old people know what now is going to happen to them .
at the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly , the happy extreme , are the new guinea farming societies where i 've been doing my fieldwork for the past 50 years , and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world .
in those societies , older people are cared for .
and they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children , relatives and lifelong friends .
the variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society 's values .
first , as regards usefulness , older people continue to perform useful services .
one use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food .
another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren , thereby freeing up their own adult children , the parents of those grandchildren , to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren .
finally , older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern , literate societies , where our sources of information are books and the internet .
it 's their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience .
their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society 's treatment of the elderly .
the other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society 's cultural values .
cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the u.s .
older americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications .
they 're at a big disadvantage in hospitals .
there are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the u.s .
one is our protestant work ethic which places high value on work , so older people who are no longer working are n't respected .
another reason is our american emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence , so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent .
instead , the only american ads featuring white-haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning .
well , what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies ?
another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people .
changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past .
another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age , because older people , their children , and their friends , all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives .
we americans move on the average every five years .
hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth .
perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies .
the slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old , but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later .
today , though , those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight-digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator .
conversely , i at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life .
what can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the u.s. , and to make better use of their value ?
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children .
compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers , grandparents offer superior , motivated , experienced child care .
unlike other caregivers , grandparents do n't quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby .
a second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology .
for example , only americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression , the experience of living through a world war , and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs .
most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things , but millions of older americans do .
unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
younger people do n't .
a challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing .
some abilities , of course , decrease with age .
conversely , valuable attributes that increase with age include experience , understanding of people and human relationships , ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way , and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases , such as economics and comparative history , best left to scholars over the age of 60 .
hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising , administering , advising , strategizing , teaching , synthesizing , and devising long-term plans .
paradoxically nowadays , when we have more elderly people than ever before , living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before , old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before .
we can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies .
but what 's true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well .
but there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies , and perhaps to be learned from them .
their children are more self-confident , more independent , and more socially skilled than are our children .
those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
i hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as i found it to live in those societies .
i 'm not sure if any of you have noticed , but i 'm fat .
i 'm not even the more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous kind .
and this way of thinking is known as fatphobia .
like any form of systematic oppression , fatphobia is deeply rooted in complex structures like capitalism , patriarchy and racism , and that can make it really difficult to see , let alone challenge .
easy .
but we must question it , because the enormous value we place on how we look affects every one of us .
i was about a foot taller and a foot wider than most of the group .
when it came to doing our first performance , i was so excited about wearing a pretty pink tutu .
i was going to sparkle .
as the other girls slipped easily into their lycra and tulle creations , not one of the tutus was big enough to fit me .
i 've spent the last 20 years unpacking and deprogramming these messages , and it 's been quite the roller coaster .
( cheer ) thanks .
instead , we value mental health , self-worth and how we feel in our bodies as vital aspects to our overall well-being .
there are doctors , academics and bloggers who have written countless volumes on the many facets of this complex subject .
there are fat athletes who run marathons , teach yoga or do kickboxing , all done with a middle finger firmly held up to the status quo .
and these people have taught me that radical body politics is the antidote to our body-shaming culture .
reclaiming yourself can be one of the most gorgeous acts of self-love and can look like a million different things , from hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring to hormones to surgery and yes , even weight loss .
it 's simple : it 's your body , and you decide what 's best to do with it .
and reclaiming spaces en masse is not only a powerful artistic statement but a radical community-building approach .
`` this was so true of `` '' aquaporko ! '' '' — ( laughter ) the fat fem synchronized swim team i started with a group of friends in sydney . ''
the impact of seeing a bunch of defiant fat women in flowery swimming caps and bathers throwing their legs in the air without a care should not be underestimated .
when director kate champion , of acclaimed dance theater company force majeure , asked me to be the artistic associate on a work featuring all fat dancers , i literally jumped at the opportunity .
`` `` '' nothing to lose '' '' is a work made in collaboration with performers of size who drew from their lived experiences to create a work as varied and authentic as we all are . ''
and it was as far from ballet as you could imagine .
where did they do their dance training ?
`` are they going to have the stamina for a full-length production ? '' '' but despite the skepticism , `` '' nothing to lose '' '' became a sellout hit of sydney festival . ''
we received rave reviews , toured , won awards and were written about in over 27 languages .
but of course , work that pushes people 's buttons is not without its detractors .
i have been told that i 'm glorifying obesity .
because the real elephant in the room here is fatphobia .
by advocating for self-determination and respect for all of us , we can shift society 's reluctance to embrace diversity and start to celebrate the myriad ways there are to have a body .
imagine that you are a product designer .
let 's call him bob .
i can see from your face that you 're having some problems with this .
i do n't want to take you through the gory details , i just want to tell you about some of the amazing features of this product .
and the design is completely modular .
you have the surface barrier of the human skin , you have the very rapidly reacting innate immune system and then you have the highly targeted adaptive immune system .
the point is , that if one system fails , another can take over , creating a virtually foolproof system .
i can see i 'm losing you , bob , but stay with me , because here is the really killer feature .
what i 'm pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product .
the product is embedded in the larger system of the human body , and it works in complete harmony with that system , to create this unprecedented level of biological protection .
and bob may say something like , i sincerely appreciate the effort and passion that have gone into your presentation , blah blah blah — ( laughter ) but honestly , it 's total nonsense .
now , if you were the ceo of such a company , badgered by investors and buffeted by change , we might forgive you for not even worrying too much about what happens 30 years out .
that 's a one in three chance that your company will be taken over or will fail within just five years .
as a lapsed biologist , i decided to immediately call a real biologist , my friend simon levin , professor of biology and mathematics at princeton university .
together , we looked at a variety of biological systems , ranging from natural tropical rainforests through to managed forests and fisheries .
and we asked ourselves the question : what makes these systems resilient and enduring ?
we also went on to look at business , and found that these very same properties also characterized businesses that were resilient and long-lived , and we noted their absence from ones which were short-lived .

it was built by a korean artisan , because at the time , japan was not yet building temples .
the company failed , and it was taken over by a major construction company .
much more interesting , however , is the question : why did fujifilm — same product , same pressures from digital technology , same time — why was fujifilm able to survive and flourish ?
fujifilm used its capabilities in chemistry , material science and optics to diversify into a number of areas , ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals , to medical systems to biomaterials .
`` as the ceo , mr. komori , put it , the strategy succeeded because it had `` '' more pockets and drawers '' '' than the rivals . ''
fujifilm survived because it applied the principles of prudence , diversity and adaptation .
car production ground to a screeching halt .
from having no braking valves to complete recovery in five days .
now fortunately , few companies succumb to catastrophic fires .
and yes , technology disruption is not only a big deal in software and electronics .
well , change has to first start in the mind .
so what do you think ?
why ?
the great texts of the ancient world do n't survive to us in their original form .
they survive because medieval scribes copied them and copied them and copied them .
and so it is with archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
and archimedes codex c was just one of those seven .
he took apart the archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts .
he erased all of their texts , and then he cut the sheets down in the middle , he shuffled them up , and he rotated them 90 degrees , and he wrote prayers on top of these books .
the prayer book was discovered by this guy , johan ludvig heiberg , in 1906 .
why did he buy this book ?
and it was an expensive job , but actually it would n't be as much as you think because these people , they did n't come from money , they came from archimedes .
they came from particle physics , they came from classical philology , they came from book conservation , they came from ancient mathematics , they came from data management , they came from scientific imaging and program management .
the first problem was a conservation problem .
and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with : there was glue on the spine of the book .
and if you look at this photograph carefully , the bottom half of this is rather brown .
and that glue is hide glue .
now if you 're a conservator , you can take off this glue reasonably easily .
and it 's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on .
and so before we could start imaging archimedes , we had to take this book apart .
so it took four years to take apart .
( laughter ) another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax , because this was used in the liturgical services of the greek orthodox church and they 'd used candle wax .
so very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax .
so , tiny fragments we actually managed to put back in the right place .
then , having done that , we started to image the manuscript .
and we imaged the manuscript in 14 different wavebands of light .
so what we did was we processed the images together , and we put two images into one blank screen .
and in the image on the right you might be able to see some of the archimedes writing .
if you merge them together into one digital canvas , the parchment is bright in both images and it comes out bright .
and that 's what it looks like .
you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in and you zoom in , and you can just read it now .
( applause ) if you process the same two images in a different way , you can actually get rid of the prayer book text .
and this is terribly important , because the diagrams in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century b.c .
and there we are , i can give them to you .
with this kind of imaging — this kind of infrared , ultraviolet , invisible light imaging — we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries .
how were we going to do that ?
well we took the manuscript , and we decided to image it in x-ray fluorescence imaging .
and when it takes its place , it sheds electromagnetic radiation .
because the ink was written in iron .
and if we can map where this x-ray that comes out , where it comes from , we can map all the iron on the page , then theoretically we can read the image .
the thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this .
so we took it to the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory in california , which is a particle accelerator .
electrons go around one way , positrons go around the other .
they meet in the middle , and they create subatomic particles like the charm quark and the tau lepton .
but as the electrons go round at the speed of light , they shed x-rays .
and this is the most powerful light source in the solar system .
this is called synchrotron radiation , and it 's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing .
and lo and behold , we found that we could do it .
so what did we discover ?
`` well one of the unique texts in archimedes is called `` '' the stomachion . '' '' and this did n't exist in codices a and b . ''
and we knew that it involved this square .
and the important point about this is that it 's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics .
the really astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made , the scribe had made his book out of , and one of them was a manuscript containing text by hyperides .
he was an exact contemporary of demosthenes .
alexander the great went on to conquer the known world ; hyperides found himself on trial for treason .
but if you ca n't win , then you should fight for a noble cause , because then you 'll be remembered .
now i should say at this point that normally when you 're looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off , you do n't find unique texts .
and to find two in one manuscript is really something .
to find three is completely weird .
and we found three .
`` aristotle 's `` '' categories '' '' is one of the foundational texts of western philosophy . ''
and we found a third century a.d. commentary on it , possibly by galen and probably by porphyry .
( applause ) why did the owner of the manuscript do this ?
because institutions at the moment confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing .
what you want to do is to aggregate it all together .
because the web of the ancient manuscripts of the future is n't going to be built by institutions .
it 's going to be built by users , by people who get this data together , by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps from wherever they come from , all sorts of medieval romances from wherever they come from , people who just want to curate their own glorious selection of beautiful things .
and it 's an attractive and beautiful future , if only we can make it happen .
( applause ) now , let 's think about this for a minute .
there are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution .
because what 's really in it for the institution is this : now why do people go to the louvre ?
they go to see the mona lisa .
why do they go to see the mona lisa ?
now , there is no need for these restrictions at all .
why do n't we just let everybody have access to this data and curate their own collection of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things and increase the beauty and the cultural significance of the internet .
thank you very much indeed .
so if someone asked you for the three words that would sum up your reputation , what would you say ?
i caught up with him recently , where , over the course of several cups of tea , he told me how hosting guests from all over the world has enriched his life .
and so sebastian bought squeak to protect his reputation .
it 's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before .
this image here is from 2008 .
the pink dots represent host properties .
even four years ago , letting strangers stay in your home seemed like a crazy idea .
and now , 2012 .
but the real magic and the secret source behind collaborative consumption marketplaces like airbnb is n't the inventory or the money .
it 's using the power of technology to build trust between strangers .
this side of airbnb really hit home to sebastian last summer during the london riots .
former guests from around the world had seen that the riots were happening just down the street , and wanted to check if he needed anything .
now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard-wired in all of us .
we 're literally beginning to realize that we have wired our world to share , swap , rent , barter or trade just about anything . we 're sharing our cars on whipcar , our bikes on spinlister , our offices on loosecubes , our gardens on landshare . we 're lending and borrowing money from strangers on zopa and lending club .
we are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making to coding on skillshare , and we 're even sharing our pets on dogvacay .
now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption that 's enabling us to match wants with haves in more democratic ways .
meet 46-year-old chris mok , who has , i bet , the best job title here of superrabbit .
and then he happened to stumble across a post about taskrabbit .
they realized they 'd run out of dog food .
kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow .
now , later that evening , the two self-confessed tech geeks starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of ebay for errands existed .
six months later , leah quit her job , and taskrabbit was born .
yes , there 's actually a four-stage , rigorous interview process that 's designed to find the people that would make great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy rabbits .
now , when you think about it , it 's amazing , right , that over the past 20 years , we 've evolved from trusting people online to share information to trusting to handing over our credit card information , and now we 're entering the third trust wave : connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people-powered marketplaces .
i actually came across this fascinating study by the pew center this week that revealed that an active facebook user is three times as likely as a non-internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy .
virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another face to face .
now , with all of my optimism , and i am an optimist , comes a healthy dose of caution , or rather , an urgent need to address some pressing , complex questions .
how do we stop people who 've behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise ?
in a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan , or the rate of a mortgage , marketplaces that depend on transactions between relative strangers need some kind of device to let you know that sebastian and chris are good eggs , and that device is reputation .
you can see that over 200 people have given him an average rating over 4.99 out of 5 .
there are over 20 pages of reviews of his work describing him as super-friendly and fast , and he 's reached level 25 , the highest level , making him a superrabbit .
now — ( laughter ) — i love that word , superrabbit .
and interestingly , what chris has noted is that as his reputation has gone up , so has his chances of winning a bid and how much he can charge .
in other words , for superrabbits , reputation has a real world value .
now , i know what you might be thinking .
well , this is n't anything new . just think of power sellers on ebay or star ratings on amazon .
and it 's not just the breadth but the volume of reputation data out there that is staggering .
it 's a bit like when i moved from new york to sydney .
it was ridiculous . i could n't get a mobile phone plan because my credit history did n't travel with me .
now i 'm not suggesting that the next stage of the reputation economy is about adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score .
people 's lives are too complex , and who wants to do that ?
those guys are measuring influence , not behaviors that indicate our trustworthiness .
just because sebastian is a wonderful host does not mean that he can assemble ikea furniture .
there are actually a wave of startups like connect.me and legit and trustcloud that are figuring out how you can aggregate , monitor and use your online reputation .
now , i realize that this concept may sound a little big brother to some of you , and yes , there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve , but ultimately , if we can collect our personal reputation , we can actually control it more , and extract the immense value that will flow from it .
also , more so than our credit history , we can actually shape our reputation .
ultimately , when we get it right , reputation capital could create a massive positive disruption in who has power , trust and influence .
reputation will be the currency that says that you can trust me .
now the interesting thing is , reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .
let me give you one example from the world of recruiting , where reputation data will make the résumé seem like an archaic relic of the past .
now , stack overflow is basically a platform where experienced programmers can ask other good programmers highly detailed technical questions on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions .
this site receives five and a half thousand questions a day , and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers .
now thousands of programmers today are finding better jobs this way , because stack overflow and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window into how someone really behaves , and what their peers think of them .
people are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built .
when you talk to super-users , whether that 's superrabbits or super-people on stack overflow , or uberhosts , they all talk about how having a high reputation unlocks a sense of their own power .
on airbnb , the people often become more important than the spaces . on taskrabbit , it gives people control of their economic activity .
now at the end of my tea with sebastian , he told me how , on a bad , rainy day , when he has n't had a customer in his bookstore , he thinks of all the people around the world who 've said something wonderful about him , and what that says about him as a person .
he 's turning 50 this year , and he 's convinced that the rich tapestry of reputation he 's built on airbnb will lead him to doing something interesting with the rest of his life .
you know , there are only a few windows in history where the opportunity exists to reinvent part of how our socioeconomic system works .
i believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution that will be as significant as the industrial revolution .
thank you very much . ( applause ) ( applause )
yet we consider it a taboo .
i learned to be ashamed of my body .
hi everyone .
thank you .
and i want to share with you my latest art project .
it 's a children 's book for the ipad .
it 's a little quirky and silly .
`` it 's called `` '' pop-it , '' '' and it 's about the things little kids do with their parents . ''
you can make the baby poop .
you can do all those fun things .
but you know , i have a problem with children 's books : i think they 're full of propaganda .
it 's not the way i was brought up .
shake it , and you have a lesbian couple .
( laughter ) shake it , and you have a heterosexual couple .
you know , i do n't even believe in the concept of an ideal family .
i went to this very proper christian school taught by nuns , fathers , brothers , sisters .
and i 'd go at the end of the day to a traditional hindu house , which was probably the only hindu house in a predominantly islamic neighborhood .
( laughter ) we all had to fast during ramadan .
but i must say , i 'll never forget , when i was 13 years old , this happened .
and for the first time , i was affected by this communal unrest .
`` my little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in , and he says , `` '' rags , rags . ''
imagine history being taught differently .
remember that children 's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change ?
i have another idea .
it 's a children 's book about indian independence — very patriotic .
even my books on children have cute , fuzzy animals .
but they 're playing geopolitics .
and my argument [ is ] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage .
after all , children 's books are manuals on parenting , so you better give them children 's books that teach them perspectives .
and conversely , only when you teach perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone who is different from them .
i 'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .
( applause )
so we 're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
we all want to be stars — celebrities , singers , comedians — and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world 's culture .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
three things : tastemakers , communities of participation and unexpectedness .
( laughter ) this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that 's what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
jimmy kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .
because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
( video ) rebecca black : ♫ it 's friday , friday . got ta get down on friday . ♫ ♫ everybody 's looking forward to the weekend , weekend . ♫ ♫ friday , friday . gettin ' down on friday . ♫ ka : so you did n't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
`` rebecca black 's `` '' friday '' '' is one of the most popular videos of the year . ''
this is a chart of what it looked like .
and if you 're wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
( laughter ) but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
well tosh.0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
but what 's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process .
even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
( laughter ) unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon — either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
`` ( music ) so `` '' nyan cat '' '' is a looped animation with looped music . ''
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-hour version of this that 's been viewed four million times .
( laughter ) even cats were watching this video . ( laughter )
but what 's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie , geeky internet culture .
and then it went international . ( laughter )
an entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in new york city , i admit i was n't very interested .
( laughter ) ka : what does it mean ?
tastemakers , creative participating communities , complete unexpectedness , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity .
no one has to green-light your idea .
and these are not characteristics of old media , and they 're barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
dance is a language , and social dance is an expression that emerges from a community .
a social dance is n't choreographed by any one person .
it ca n't be traced to any one moment .
they are as old as our remembered history .
it was the same subversive spirit that created this dance : the cakewalk , a dance that parodied the mannerisms of southern high society — a way for the enslaved to throw shade at the masters .
the crazy thing about this dance is that the cakewalk was performed for the masters , who never suspected they were being made fun of .
the charleston was all about improvisation and musicality , making its way into lindy hop , swing dancing and even the kid n play , originally called the funky charleston .
now , social dance is about community and connection ; if you knew the steps , it meant you belonged to a group .
enter the twist .
it 's no surprise that the twist can be traced back to the 19th century , brought to america from the congo during slavery .
the story continues in the 1980s and '90s .
to move , to let loose , to express .
after all , what 's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iphone assembly line ca n't even afford to buy one ?
we must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways .
by focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets , we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility , as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone .
chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for ipods .
they choose to leave their homes in order to earn money , to learn new skills , and to see the world .
in the ongoing debate about globalization , what 's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves .
here are a few .
`` i told them that i studied and worked hard . if you tell them more , they wo n't understand anyway . '' '' wu chunming : `` '' even if i make a lot of money , it wo n't satisfy me . ''
certain subjects came up over and over : how much money they made , what kind of husband they hoped to marry , whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were .
other subjects came up almost never , including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life : 10 or 15 workers in one room , 50 people sharing a single bathroom , days and nights ruled by the factory clock .
everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances , and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural china .
`` when i asked lu qingmin , the young woman i got to know best , what exactly she did on the factory floor , she said something to me in chinese that sounded like `` qiu xi . '' ''
`` only much later did i realize that she had been saying `` '' qc , '' '' or quality control . ''
karl marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism , the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor .
unlike , say , a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets , the worker in an industrial factory has no control , no pleasure , and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work .
but like so many theories that marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the british museum , he got this one wrong .
journalistic coverage of chinese factories , on the other hand , plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make .
many articles calculate : how long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he 's making ?
for example , i recently wrote an article in the new yorker magazine , but i ca n't afford to buy an ad in it .
how long should i stay in this factory ?
how much will it take to buy an apartment or a car , to get married , or to put my child through school ?
the workers i got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor .
about a year after i met lu qingmin , or min , she invited me home to her family village for the chinese new year .
on the train home , she gave me a present : a coach brand change purse with brown leather trim .
after we got home , min gave her mother another present : a pink dooney & bourke handbag , and a few nights later , her sister was showing off a maroon lesportsac shoulder bag .
`` min 's sister said to her parents , `` in america , this bag sells for 320 dollars . '' ''
once , when min 's older sister 's friend got married , she brought a handbag along as a wedding present .
in 1941 , the burnished patina of an all-american baseball glove inspired the founder of coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather .
six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair .
`` they were fresh , functional , and women everywhere adored them . a new american classic was born . '' '' i wonder what karl marx would have made of min and her sisters . ''
their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated , surprising and funny than he could have imagined .
the first time i met min , she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory .
very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be .
when i first went to dongguan , i worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers .
by opening up their lives to me , they taught me so much about factories and about china and about how to live in the world .
i keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women i wrote about , ties that are not economic but personal in nature , measured not in money but in memories .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) chris anderson : thank you , leslie , that was an insight that a lot of us have n't had before .
but i 'm curious . if you had a minute , say , with apple 's head of manufacturing , what would you say ?
leslie chang : one minute ?
they usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade .
when you talk to workers , that 's what they want .
lc : oh definitely , definitely . i mean , you know , it was interesting , because i spent basically two years hanging out in this city , dongguan , and over that time , you could see immense change in every person 's life : upward , downward , sideways , but generally upward .
certainly , the factory conditions are really tough , and it 's nothing you or i would want to do , but from their perspective , where they 're coming from is much worse , and where they 're going is hopefully much better , and i just wanted to give that context of what 's going on in their minds , not what necessarily is going on in yours .
religion is more than belief .
i was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up .
i grew up in an enormously traditional family .
and i grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing was in keeping these rules that i 'd known my whole life .
i had help raising my little daughter .
we 've been working very , very , very hard for the last decade and more .
we got hate mail on a daily basis .
we received death threats .
and i began to expect this reaction from my own people .
i know what it feels like when you feel like someone 's trying to change you or criticize you .
they 're intelligent people . they 're lovely people .
in mormonism , we believe that after you die , if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals , you can be together as a family again .
`` i can not tell you the hundreds of people who have said , `` if you do n't like religion , just leave . '' ''
why would you try to change it ?
these laws get legally and culturally codified .
how many lives did that affect ?
why is that the assumption ?
religions ca n't be dismissed or ignored .
my groups are small , there 's hundreds of us , but we 've had huge impact .
and we can do it through unignorable acts of bravery , standing up for gender equality .
it 's time that half of the world 's population had voice and equality within our world 's religions , churches , synagogues , mosques and shrines around the world .
i 'm working on my people . what are you doing for yours ?
it 's not the worst thing in the world .
and it is a very weird thing , because proper nouns are the worst .
it 's not about mythology , or mythologizing myself to you .
this is a song that i wrote last year .
`` beatjazz is : 1. live looping , 2. jazz improvisation and 3 . `` `` gestural '' '' sound design . ''
accelerometers on each hand read hand position .
the color of the lights indicates which sound i am playing .
red = drums , blue = bass , green = chords , orange = leads , purple = pads the mouthpiece consists of ...
why ?
`` and `` beatjazzers '' become as common as d.j. 's . ''
to make the future rather than wait for it .
so we 've got quite a few of these to get through .
i 'm freezing .
it 's like a meat locker in here in this recording studio .
i ca n't hear you through the glass , honey !
yes , now remind me again , you 're recording not only my voice but my feelings and my memories ? right .
yes , bert , yes , i read about it .
no , right , i 'm ready .
so , like , hello , bert person of the future who is experiencing me .
all right , you want me to start talking now .
yeah , no , but , tell me again what the name of — bert ? bert .
oh , i 'm sorry , but you got to get into the spirit of it if you 're going to interview me .
pshh , you know how hard it is being a domestic worker ?
well , you have to have a sense of humor about it , that 's what i think .
well , i 've got this terrible dichotomy .
no , my one sister virginia gave me a fiver for the coach to dublin , and that 's how i ended up here .
he had me supporting the both of us .
i was 18 .
that julia roberts , if she 'd ever had to sleep with a man to put a few pounds in her pocket , i do n't think she 'd ever have made that film .
you know , i never was a wife or a nun , or a prostitute even , really , not really .
we 've all been there , right ?
but they loved it , and so did we .
did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent ?
now , when you 're faced with a problem , you fall back on what you know , and all we really knew was design .
could design make that happen ?
i want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve .
ok , i need you to take out your phones .
now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left .
now , how does it feel holding someone 's unlocked phone ?
that 's how most guests feel when they stay in a home .
the research showed , not surprisingly , we prefer people who are like us .
the right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases .
this is what happens when a guest first messages a host .
`` if you share too little , like , `` '' yo , '' '' acceptance rates go down . ''
we use the size of the box to suggest the right length , and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing .
we bet our whole company on the hope that , with the right design , people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias .
this is a graph that shows our rate of adoption .
there 's three things happening here .
the second is the efforts of our team .
and third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need .
in the early days , i was customer service , and those calls came right to my cell phone .
thankfully , out of the 123 million nights we 've ever hosted , less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic .
turns out , people are justified in their trust .
they donated their own blood for his operation .
let me read you his review .
javier and alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you .
how do sharing and transactions go together ?
so let 's be clear ; it is about commerce .
people share a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
what if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences ?
or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant ?
what would that look like ?
i see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation .
we did n't invent anything new .
there 's been many other websites like ours .
it blows my mind .
now , we know design wo n't solve all the world 's problems .
their beauty immerses us with color , taste , touch .
( music ) nature 's beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude . ( music )
we so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment , with clouds coming and going .
we all go back so far , and in this present moment , on this day , all the people you meet , all that life from generations and from so many places all over the world flows together and meets you here like a life-giving water , if you only open your heart and drink .
so these are just a few of an enormous number of gifts to which we can open your heart .
but what happened when we looked inside the pig 's heart , to the electrogram ?
it 's implanted with very conventional techniques .
and then , finally , a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation , which is the level which says you are having a heart attack .
what does that mean ?
anchor : for anyone who suffers from migraine headaches — and there are 30 million americans who do — tonight : a possible answer .
ss : researchers are hoping to present their studies to the fda this summer .
now , why do we use — add on , nearly , an epileptic focus ?
that would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the united states and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone .
and it 's a kind of rope-like structure that twirls and swirls like this .
my mother told me to take it smaller .
some of them were quite jagged .
i used a little tweezer which i made from a hair clip .
and then pushing the glass in with its own friction .
( applause ) ( laughter ) right . as you can see , bart simpson is having a little argument .
but i had to make a little barrier , going around it , out of cellophane , to stop it moving .
decided to make a paintbrush .
and i looked at it underneath the microscope .
so i have to be very quick .
i would say it probably measures ...
and then i went ...
they go in with their own friction .
and that 's 24-karat gold . and it 's constructed . i built it .
i would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
more recently , if you 've been following the kenyan press — ( laughter ) ( applause ) ( cheers ) — these are the attributes that they associated the kenyan mps with . but i want to challenge that .
they have been associated in ancient egyptian culture .
we have eight species of vultures that occur in kenya , of which six are highly threatened with extinction .
this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india , and they have taken a stand .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it 's not going to help you .
today , i want to show you a new kind of map .
and then the flamengo football team is also represented here .
( applause )
what do you call the leader of a republican country ?
at least for the people on the top .
why is google the search engine of choice for you ?
how does this work ?
you get why — to manipulate the search result .
but then , a couple of years go by , and the world 's most-googled anders , anders behring breivik , did what he did .
no powerpoint is used in two days .
( applause )
the government calls these units communications management units or cmus .
they 've included people like yassin aref .
aref and his family fled to new york from saddam hussein 's iraq as refugees .
second , because it would make me the first and only journalist to visit a cmu .
so how could i possibly be approved to visit ?
i was allowed to visit mcgowan as a friend , not a journalist .
journalists are not allowed here .
when a cmu prisoner has a visit , the rest of the prison is on lockdown .
during our visit , mcgowan spoke most and at length about his niece lily , his wife jenny and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them , to never be able to hold their hands .
prisoners were locked down in solitary for 22 hours a day .
it is about us .
thank you .
then there 's another kind of taker that we wo n't be addressing today , and that 's called a psychopath .
and i found that most people are right in the middle between giving and taking .
and , unexpectedly , the worst performers in each of these jobs were the givers .
`` in medical school , the lowest grades belong to the students who agree most strongly with statements like , `` i love helping others , '' which suggests the doctor you ought to trust is the one who came to med school with no desire to help anybody . ''
( laughter ) and then in sales , too , the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople .
ok , it would have been more before we talked about these data .
( laughter ) and that way justice gets served .
and so the logical conclusion is : it must be the matchers who are the best performers .
but they 're not .
in every job , in every organization i 've ever studied , the best results belong to the givers again .
they make up the majority of people who bring in the lowest revenue , but also the highest revenue .
i want to talk about how to do that , not just in businesses , but also in nonprofits , schools — even governments .
so you have to protect the givers in your midst .
and i learned a great lesson about this from fortune 's best networker .
he 's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount of his time helping other people .
and his secret weapon is the five-minute favor .
we can make it easier for people to ask for help .
but a lot of people do n't ask .
we 're actually pretty bad at figuring out who 's a taker , especially on first impressions .
there 's a personality trait that throws us off .
how could i ever say i 'm any one thing when i 'm constantly adapting to try to please other people ?
disagreeable people do less of it .
there are disagreeable givers in our organizations .
this is the person who 's nice to your face , and then will stab you right in the back .
givers are more likely to name people who are below them in a hierarchy , who do n't have as much power , who can do them no good .
and if we can spread that belief , we can actually turn paranoia upside down .
first of all , i 'm a geek .
we then put in framing .
and yet , all the press is focused on that .
she 's not a high-powered political staffer , nor a lobbyist .
she 'd probably tell you she 's quite unremarkable , but she 's having the most remarkable impact .
far from it .
a global citizen is someone who self-identifies first and foremost not as a member of a state , a tribe or a nation , but as a member of the human race , and someone who is prepared to act on that belief , to tackle our world 's greatest challenges .
`` `` '' what is a shrimp , and why do we have to keep throwing them on the barbie ? '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' and mum — this haircut . ''
`` as a `` '' why '' '' kid , i thought i could change the world , and it was impossible to convince me otherwise . ''
and when i was 12 and in my first year of high school , i started raising money for communities in the developing world .
we were a really enthusiastic group of kids , and we raised more money than any other school in australia .
`` `` '' smoky mountain '' '' was what they called it . ''
sure , they did n't create smoky mountain , but they may as well have .
and if we 're to try to help kids like sonny boy , it would n't work just to try to send him a few dollars or to try to clean up the garbage dump on which he lived , because the core of the problem lay elsewhere .
and as i worked on community development projects over the coming years trying to help build schools , train teachers , and tackle hiv and aids , i came to see that community development should be driven by communities themselves , and that although charity is necessary , it 's not sufficient .
and the best thing i could do is try to mobilize a large group of citizens back home to insist that our leaders engage in that systemic change .
that 's why , a few years later , i joined with a group of college friends in bringing the make poverty history campaign to australia .
( laughter ) but to our amazement , the australian government heard our collective voices , and they agreed to double investment into global health and development — an additional 6.2 billion dollars .
but here 's the thing : it did n't last .
what did we learn ?
we learned that one-off spikes are not enough .
we needed a sustainable movement , not one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician or the hint of an economic downturn .
and it needed to happen everywhere ; otherwise , every individual government would have this built-in excuse mechanism that they could n't possibly carry the burden of global action alone .
we could only think of one way .
so in 2012 , we cofounded an organization that had exactly that as its goal .
this is about citizens taking action .
and research data tells us that of the total population who even care about global issues , only 18 percent have done anything about it .
it 's not that people do n't want to act .
so we had to somehow recruit and activate millions of citizens in dozens of countries to put pressure on their leaders to behave altruistically .
and as we did so , we discovered something really thrilling , that when you make global citizenship your mission , you suddenly find yourself with some extraordinary allies .
see , extreme poverty is n't the only issue that 's fundamentally global .
so , too , is climate change , human rights , gender equality , even conflict .
well , we used the universal language : music .
but there was a twist : you could n't buy a ticket .
activism is the currency .
i had no interest in citizenship purely as some sort of feel-good thing .
for me , citizenship means you have to act , and that 's what we required .
and amazingly , it worked .
we 're already everywhere .
and this is where i believe we can learn a lot from davinia , who started taking action as a global citizen back in 2012 .
it was n't rocket science .
she volunteered her time in her local community .
now , maybe that does n't sound like a lot to you .
how will that achieve anything ?
well , it achieved a lot because she was n't alone .
and here 's dr. raj shah , the head of usaid , making that announcement .
global citizens like davinia helped persuade the world bank to boost their investment into water and sanitation .
global citizens together with rotarians called on the canadian , uk , and australian governments to boost their investment into polio eradication .
they got together and committed 665 million dollars .
`` indeed , the powerful american politician tip o'neill once said , `` all politics is local . '' ''
that 's what always got politicians elected : to seek , gain and hold onto power through the pursuit of local or at very best national interests .
i took a meeting with a then-australian foreign minister who shall remain nameless — [ alexander downer ] ( laughter ) and behind closed doors , i shared with him my passion to end extreme poverty .
`` we can do this . '' '' and he paused , looked down on me with cold , dismissive eyes , and he said , `` '' hugh , no one gives a funk about foreign aid . '' '' except he did n't use the word `` '' funk . '' '' he went on . ''
parochialism offers this false dichotomy because it pits the poor in one country against the poor in another .
it pretends we can isolate ourselves and our nations from one another .
the most we could do in those days was fire off a letter and wait for the next election .
both the problems and the tools to solve them are right before us .
the world has changed , and those of us who look beyond our borders are on the right side of history .
so we run this amazing festival , we 've scored some big policy wins , and citizens are signing up all over the world .
but have we achieved our mission ?
we have such a long way to go .
global citizens will partner with the world 's leading ngos to end diseases like polio and malaria .
over all these years , i 've tried to reconnect with sonny boy .
sadly , i 've been unable to .
i 'm a global citizen .
i collaborate with bacteria .
so what you 're seeing here is the bacteria metabolizing , and as they do so they create an electrical charge .
and this attracts metals from their local environment .
one of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water .
and the desalination process is one where we take out salts .
we can use it for drinking and agriculture .
we take the water from the sea and we apply pressure .
this takes energy , producing clean water .
but the process is very expensive and it 's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe .
and singapore proposes by 2060 to produce [ 900 ] million liters per day of desalinated water .
and this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play .
so i 'd like you to image a mining industry in a way that one has n't existed before ; imagine a mining industry that does n't mean defiling the earth ; imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine .
thank you .
it really just is n't working , and that means that patients that badly need new therapies are not getting them , and diseases are going untreated .
we seem to be spending more and more money .
so what 's going on here ?
they are cells in dishes and animal testing .
now let 's talk about the first one , cells in dishes .
so , cells are happily functioning in our bodies .
we take them and rip them out of their native environment , throw them in one of these dishes , and expect them to work .
what about animal testing ?
well , animals do and can provide extremely useful information .
they teach us about what happens in the complex organism .
however , more often than not , animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans when they 're treated with a particular drug .
so if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies , we need to become cell architects .
and at the wyss institute , we 've done just that .
and i have one right here .
it 's beautiful , is n't it ? but it 's pretty incredible .
there 's been many people trying to grow cells in the lab .
they 've even tried to grow little mini-organs in the lab .
we 're not trying to do that here .
we 're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry , the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies .
we have three fluidic channels .
and we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip that stretch and contract the membrane , so the cells experience the same mechanical forces that they did when we breathe .
there 's air flowing through the top channel , and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel .
now the chip is really beautiful , but what can we do with it ?
let me show you .
we could , for example , mimic infection , where we add bacterial cells into the lung .
then we can add human white blood cells .
well now you 're going to see this happening live in an actual human lung on a chip .
and you can see here , we can actually visualize a single white blood cell .
it sticks , it wiggles its way through between the cell layers , through the pore , comes out on the other side of the membrane , and right there , it 's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green .
it tells us that these cells from the small airways in our lungs , actually have these hairlike structures that you would expect to see in the lung .
yeah . mucus . yuck .
mucus traps particulates , viruses , potential allergens , and these little cilia move and clear the mucus out .
and that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis .
cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis .
we did n't stop with the lung on a chip .
and we 've put intestinal human cells in a gut on a chip , and they 're under constant peristaltic motion , this trickling flow through the cells , and we can mimic many of the functions that you actually would expect to see in the human intestine .
now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome .
now , the true power of this technology , however , really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them .
we 're not going to ever recreate a whole human in these chips , but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what 's going to happen in humans .
does it get cleared by the liver ?
is it metabolized in the liver ?
is it excreted in your kidneys ?
we could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment , such as chemicals in regular household cleaners .
we could also use the organs on chips for applications in bioterrorism or radiation exposure .
we could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as sars .
organs on chips could also change the way we do clinical trials in the future .
you wo n't find many clinical trials in which children are involved , yet every day , we give children medications , and the only safety data we have on that drug is one that we obtained from adults .
this could really change the way we do clinical trials .
and this is the team and the people that are doing this .
we have engineers , we have cell biologists , we have clinicians , all working together .
it 's really a convergence of disciplines , where biology is influencing the way we design , the way we engineer , the way we build .
it 's pretty exciting .
we 're establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise in large-scale digital manufacturing .
now let me show you our instrument .
this is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab , and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we 're going to require in order to link 10 or more organ chips together .
it does something else that 's very important .
so a cell biologist like me can come in , take a chip , put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there , put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a c.d. , and away you go .
it would be a personalized chip just for you .
( applause )
that 's my dad , frank , in the middle .
and one of my favorite things was picking names .
why not take advantage of this special ceremonial time ?
well , they delay because they 're afraid .
a face without a name might help them feel just a little less attached .
how can that be ?
how can it be that 2.6 million babies die around the world before they 're even one month old ?
that 's the population of vancouver .
and the shocking thing is : why ?
now , i remember recently seeing an updated pie chart .
but you ca n't fix what you ca n't define .
i trained as a cancer doctor , an oncologist .
i got into it because i wanted to help people feel better .
but too often my treatments made them feel worse .
i still remember young women being driven to my clinic by their moms — adults , who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers .
and the tools we did have could n't differentiate between the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard and those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve .
and that precision let us hit hard the cancer cells , while sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells .
everything changed .
now , i told you i trained as a cancer doctor .
it was a terrible time .
aids was a death sentence .
but we know that antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee that she will not transmit the virus to the baby .
so what do we do ?
well , a one-size-fits-all approach , kind of like that blast of chemo , would mean we test and treat every pregnant woman in the world .
that would do the job .
but it 's just not practical .
so instead , we target those areas where hiv rates are the highest .
so ...
but what if we applied a precision public health approach ?
in the absence of treatment , mom has a seven times higher chance that her next baby will die .
we can do that because then we 'll know .
why could n't we more effectively tackle malnutrition ?
why would n't we prevent cervical cancer in women ?
but you know , we all live in two worlds : the rich world and the poor world .
or was it as a mother of an autistic child ?
well , it turns out , i 'm all of these .
so let me tell you my story .
all that i am stems from when i got onto a train in vienna , part of the kindertransport that saved nearly 10,000 jewish children from nazi europe .
i 'm only alive because so long ago , i was helped by generous strangers .
and then , i just got on with it .
for years , i was the first woman this , or the only woman that .
and in those days , i could n't work on the stock exchange , i could n't drive a bus or fly an airplane .
indeed , i could n't open a bank account without my husband 's permission .
my generation of women fought the battles for the right to work and the right for equal pay .
we disguised the domestic and part-time nature of the staff by offering fixed prices , one of the very first to do so .
all this , before it ever got near a computer .
that was programming in the early 1960s .
but in my case , it came in the midst of family trauma and indeed , crisis .
because whenever i found a gap in services , i tried to help .
so it 's just as well that i 'm a workaholic .
i believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility .
work is not just something i do when i 'd rather be doing something else .
i learned that tomorrow 's never going to be like today , and certainly nothing like yesterday .
and that made me able to cope with change , indeed , eventually to welcome change , though i 'm told i 'm still very difficult .
when you hear abiola , you remember annulled elections and you think : dashed hopes .
in the southwestern part of nigeria , the plant is known as gbe'borun .
it was shortly after i had relocated from the us to nigeria .
that , i would say , was my spark moment .
it was the use of the plant for handicrafts .
that way , you create access .
( applause )
so let 's talk about effectiveness .
i do n't really believe it is .
today , i want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens .
i spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with taliban recruiters , trying to understand how the taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children were actively signing up to their cause .
we 've obtained a propaganda video made by the taliban .
young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies .
i made contact with a child from swat who studied in a madrassa like this .
how do the taliban in your area get people to join them ?
hazrat ali : they first call us to the mosque and preach to us .
then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the koran .
ha : they teach us to use machine guns , kalashnikov , rocket launchers , grenades , bombs .
soc : would you like to carry out a suicide attack ?
soc : i , in my research , have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children , and i think it 's a five-step process .
step one is that the taliban prey on families that are large , that are poor , that live in rural areas .
they rely very heavily on teachers , who i have personally seen distort the message to these children as and when it suits their purpose to .
step three : the taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in .
the children are virtual prisoners ; they can not leave , they can not go home .
step five : i believe the taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda .
and the basic message is that the western powers do not care about civilian deaths , so those people who live in areas and support governments that work with western powers are fair game .
that 's why pakistani civilians , over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone , are fair game .
now these children are primed to become suicide bombers .
they 're ready to go out and fight because they 've been told that this is effectively their only way to glorify islam .
he killed 22 .
this boy is called messoud .
he killed 28 .
do you want to carry out a suicide attack ?
boy : i would love to .
soc : what blessing would you get from carrying out a suicide attack ?
`` i will answer , `` '' my lord ! only to make you happy ! ''
if my intention was to eradicate evil for islam , then i will be rewarded with paradise .
singer : ♫ on the day of judgment ♫ ♫ my god will call me ♫ ♫ my body will be put back together ♫ ♫ and god will ask me why i did this ♫ soc : i leave you all with this thought : if you grew up in these circumstances , faced with these choices , would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious afterlife ?
thank you .
this is a song that was recorded there .
( music ) this is not talking heads , in the picture anyway .
`` ( music : `` '' a clean break ( let 's work ) '' '' by talking heads ) so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood . ''
so the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
other places around the country had similar rooms .
since then , i 've played other places that are much nicer .
i 've played the disney hall here and carnegie hall and places like that .
and it 's been very exciting .
but i also noticed that sometimes the music that i had written , or was writing at the time , did n't sound all that great in some of those halls .
we managed , but sometimes those halls did n't seem exactly suited to the music i was making or had made .
is that a kind of model for creativity ?
do we all make things with a venue , a context , in mind ?
okay , africa .
the music works perfectly in that setting .
there 's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc. , etc .
and it would be a mess in a context like this . this is a gothic cathedral .
`` ( music : `` '' spem in alium '' '' by thomas tallis ) in a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect . ''
it actually improves it .
this is the room that bach wrote some of his music for . this is the organ .
it 's not as big as a gothic cathedral , so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate .
this is the kind of rooms that mozart wrote in .
i think we 're in like 1770 , somewhere around there .
they 're smaller , even less reverberant , so he can write really frilly music that 's very intricate — and it works .
this is la scala .
and the size of the room is not that big .
it 's smaller than this .
but wagner made an innovation .
`` ( music : `` '' lohengrin / prelude to act iii '' '' by richard wagner ) okay . ''
obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
they had to be very quiet .
it meant that there could be extreme dynamics , which there were n't in some of these other kinds of music .
that was bob 's last record , yeah .
according to scott joplin , the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs .
there 's certain sections of the song — the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked .
so the bands started to improvise new melodies .
`` ( music : `` '' royal garden blues '' '' by w.c. handy / ethel waters ) these are played mainly in small rooms . ''
people are dancing , shouting and drinking .
so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that .
same thing goes true for — that 's the beginning of the century — for the whole of 20th-century popular music , whether it 's rock or latin music or whatever .
[ live music ] does n't really change that much .
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music .
microphones enabled singers , in particular , and musicians and composers , to completely change the kind of music that they were writing .
so far , a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music , but singers , like frank sinatra , could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone .
and he 's singing right into your ear .
the effect is just electric .
it 's like the guy is sitting next to you , whispering who knows what into your ear .
so at this point , music diverged .
and they no longer have to be exactly the same .
and , as with jazz , the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .
so the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections .
and another new form of music was born .
they wrote what is now called arena rock , which is medium-speed ballads .
it 's more a social situation than a musical situation .
and in some ways , the music that they 're writing for this place works perfectly .
so there 's more new venues .
one of the new ones is the automobile .
i grew up with a radio in a car .
but now that 's evolved into something else .
the car is a whole venue .
automobile music , you can share with your friends .
presumably , this is just for christian music .
( laughter ) and in some ways it 's like carnegie hall , or when the audience had to hush up , because you can now hear every single detail .
in other ways , it 's more like the west african music because if the music in an mp3 player gets too quiet , you turn it up , and the next minute , your ears are blasted out by a louder passage .
so that does n't really work .
so i asked myself : okay , is this a model for creation , this adaptation that we do ?
and does it happen anywhere else ?
well , according to david attenborough and some other people , birds do it too — that the birds in the canopy , where the foliage is dense , their calls tend to be high-pitched , short and repetitive .
and birds like this savannah sparrow , they tend to have a buzzing ( sound clip : savannah sparrow song ) type call .
and it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .
other birds , like this tanager , have adapted within the same species .
the tananger on the east coast of the united states , where the forests are a little denser , has one kind of call , and the tananger on the other side , on the west ( sound clip : scarlet tanager song ) has a different kind of call . ( sound clip : scarlet tanager song )
yeah . i think it 's evolutionary .
but the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there .
this is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional romantic view .
but this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
the writer , thomas frank , says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests , that voters , like a lot of us , assume , that if they hear something that sounds like it 's sincere , that it 's coming from the gut , that it 's passionate , that it 's more authentic .
so that , if somebody can fake sincerity , if they can fake passion , they stand a better chance of being selected in that way , which seems a little dangerous .
maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds .
we adapt .
we sing .
and like the birds , the joy is still there , even though we have changed what we do to fit the context .
thank you very much .
( applause )
this man ran across four lanes of freeway traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident that could have killed me .
and the whole thing left me really shaken up , obviously , but it also left me with this kind of burning , gnawing need to understand why he did it , what forces within him caused him to make the choice that i owe my life to , to risk his own life to save the life of a stranger ?
but first let me tell you what happened .
and i discovered why you 're not supposed to do that .
and then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety and made sure i was going to be all right , he drove off again .
( applause ) i tell you all of this because the events of that night changed the course of my life to some degree .
where does it come from , and how does it develop , and what are the extreme forms that it can take ?
the actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent definition of altruism , which is a voluntary , costly behavior motivated by the desire to help another individual .
but then the question becomes , why do some people seem to have more of it than others ?
and in particular , they have difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions like this one .
and whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions , psychopaths ' amygdalas are underreactive to these expressions .
finally , psychopaths ' amygdalas are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent .
but remember that my main interest is not understanding why people do n't care about others .
it 's understanding why they do .
so the real question is , could extraordinary altruism , which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion and the desire to help other people , emerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psychopathy ?
they are better at recognizing other people 's fear .
but i should add that what makes extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they 're more compassionate than average .
because to have compassion for people that you love and identify with is not extraordinary .
`` what is it that makes you so special ? '' '' and what do they say ? ''
`` they say , `` '' nothing . ''
`` i 'm just the same as everybody else . '' '' and i think that 's actually a really telling answer , because it suggests that the circles of these altruists do n't look like this , they look more like this . ''
they have no center .
`` your study here is going to find out that i 'm just the same as you . '' '' i think the best description for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility , which is that quality that in the words of st. augustine makes men as angels . ''
and i think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person .
and it 's led to increases in all kinds of altruism .
so what 's at the root of all these amazing changes ?
and i do n't know exactly why this is , but i think it may be that we now just know so much more about the suffering of strangers in distant places , and so we now care a lot more about the suffering of those distant strangers .
( applause )
we 've got a real problem with math education right now .
basically , no one 's very happy .
well actually , i think the answer is staring us right in the face : use computers .
i believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work .
so to explain that , let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education .
it 's done by geologists , engineers , biologists , all sorts of different people — modeling and simulation .
but in education it looks very different — dumbed-down problems , lots of calculating , mostly by hand .
lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world , except if you 're learning it .
so let 's zoom out a bit and ask , why are we teaching people math ?
`` well , i think there are about three reasons : technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies , what i call `` '' everyday living '' '' — to function in the world today , you 've got to be pretty quantitative , much more so than a few years ago : figure out your mortgages , being skeptical of government statistics , those kinds of things — and thirdly , what i would call something like logical mind training , logical thinking . ''
it 's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that .
what is it that we want to ask ? what is it we 're trying to find out here ?
and this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world , beyond virtually any other part of doing math .
people ask the wrong question , and surprisingly enough , they get the wrong answer , for that reason , if not for others .
once you 've done that , then there 's the computation step .
turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form .
and then finally , turn it back to the real world .
did it answer the question ?
and also verify it — crucial step .
now here 's the crazy thing right now .
in math education , we 're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand .
instead , we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one , two and four — conceptualizing problems , applying them , getting the teacher to run them through how to do that .
see , crucial point here : math is not equal to calculating .
now it 's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years .
there was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand .
we 've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that i could ever imagine with computers .
so i think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating .
but that math liberation did n't get into education yet .
it 's the thing you 'd like to avoid if you can , like to get a machine to do .
computers allow us to do that — and this is not a small problem by any means .
so we better be damn sure — and by the way , they did n't even have fun doing it , most of them — so we better be damn sure that we know why we 're doing that and it has a real purpose .
and i think there are some cases .
so i think practicality is one case where it 's worth teaching people by hand .
see , the thing we 're doing right now is we 're forcing people to learn mathematics .
it 's a major subject .
i was somewhat interested in ancient greek , but i do n't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient greek .
so i have this distinction between what we 're making people do and the subject that 's sort of mainstream and the subject that , in a sense , people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that .
well one of them is , they say , you need to get the basics first .
`` so my usual question is , what do you mean by `` '' basics ? '' '' basics of what ? ''
are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it , or design it for that matter ?
i do n't think so .
i think you need to separate the basics of what you 're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation .
a hundred years ago , it 's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things .
but automation in cars allowed that to separate , so driving is now a quite separate subject , so to speak , from engineering of the car or learning how to service it .
so there 's another thing that comes up with basics .
my daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this .
`` she enjoys making what she calls `` '' paper laptops . '' '' ( laughter ) so i asked her one day , `` '' you know , when i was your age , i did n't make these . ''
`` so another one that comes up is `` '' computers dumb math down . '' '' that somehow , if you use a computer , it 's all mindless button-pushing , but if you do it by hand , it 's all intellectual . ''
this one kind of annoys me , i must say .
do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they do n't really understand , for reasons they do n't get ?
might have been 50 years ago , but it is n't anymore .
when they 're out of education , they do it on a computer .
now , of course , like any great tool , they can be used completely mindlessly , like turning everything into a multimedia show , like the example i was shown of solving an equation by hand , where the computer was the teacher — show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand .
why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway ?
let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate .
but you see , when you 're using a computer , you can just substitute .
do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers ?
i do n't think so — quite the opposite .
it 's called programming .
if you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it .
so programming is the way i think we should be doing that .
i ca n't think of any other subject where that 's recently been possible .
so calculus has traditionally been taught very late .
well , it 's damn hard doing the calculations , that 's the problem .
but actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group .
this was an example i built for my daughter .
we were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number .
and of course , it turns into a circle .
very simple example .
and yet , that 's a really important practical view of the world .
so one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams .
in the end , if we test everyone by hand in exams , it 's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters .
and one of the reasons it 's so important — so it 's very important to get computers in exams .
how many years of protection do i need ?
now i 'm not for one minute suggesting it 's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams , but i think it 's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people 's real understanding .
so i believe [ there is ] critical reform we have to do in computer-based math .
`` in fact , i even talk about us moving from what we often call now the `` '' knowledge economy '' '' to what we might call a `` '' computational knowledge economy , '' '' where high-level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is . ''
and let 's understand : this is not an incremental sort of change .
and you know if you walk across a chasm , you end up making it worse than if you did n't start at all — bigger disaster .
no , what i 'm suggesting is that we should leap off , we should increase our velocity so it 's high , and we should leap off one side and go the other — of course , having calculated our differential equation very carefully .
calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years .
now i 'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math , but what i am sure is it 's the mainstream subject of the future .
we are used to invitations , but this invitation really thrilled us .
the swiss embassy in berlin is special .
they were n't as sophisticated as those used by the americans and the british .
and people did communicate .
we also organized guided tours to experience and sound out the power constellations on-site .
let 's look at an actual example .
it 's a vicious circle .
it 's not poverty , not racism , not exclusion that are new .
we were recently in australia .
but the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity .
europe is now facing a stream of migrants .
the other half of your artistic duo is also here .
i had just gotten engaged to marry the love of my life .
but this time it was n't fine .
i would walk straight into door frames .
he had his laboratory tests , which always came back normal .
maybe this is what it 's like to be on the other side of 25 .
sometimes i would find that i could n't draw the right side of a circle .
the symptoms were real , he said , but they had no biological cause .
i was training to be a social scientist .
i felt like i could n't just reject my neurologist 's diagnosis .
i thought i had a rare disease , something doctors had never seen .
if my husband goes for a run , he might be sore for a couple of days .
it does n't matter what you once were ; you ca n't do it anymore .
in the us , where i 'm from , it 's about one million people .
twenty-five percent of us are homebound or bedridden , and 75 to 85 percent of us ca n't even work part-time .
the cure was marriage and motherhood .
doctors thought it was a new form of polio .
why has this idea had such staying power ?
the problem is that this can cause real harm .
nine years later , 12 of them were dead and 30 had become disabled .
here 's the good part : despite everything , i still have hope .
so many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms .
and recently , we used to think that stomach ulcers were just caused by stress , until we discovered that h. pylori was the culprit .
me has never benefited from the kind of science that other diseases have had , but that 's starting to change .
what also gives me hope is the resilience of patients .
we experimented on ourselves .
i still had to make ridiculous choices : will i sit in the garden for 15 minutes , or will i wash my hair today ?
i had a sick body ; that was all .
i came together with patients around the world , and we started to fight .
but i am so grateful for how far i have come .
i probably would have already taken my own life , as so many others have done .
how many lives could we have saved , decades ago , if we had asked the right questions ?
even once the true cause of my disease is discovered , if we do n't change our institutions and our culture , we will do this again to another disease .
doctors , scientists and policy makers are not immune to the same biases that affect all of us .
`` we need to listen to patients ' stories , and we need to be willing to say , `` '' i do n't know . '' '' `` `` i do n't know '' '' is a beautiful thing . ''
so would n't it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do , as we 're walking around being able to point a phone at anything , and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human brain , and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas .
so the best way of explaining it is to just show it .
so let me start with this .
what we have here is a painting of the great poet rabbie burns , and it 's just a normal image , but if we now switch inputs over to the phone , running our technology , you can see effectively what tamara 's seeing on the screen , and when she points at this image , something magical happens .
matt mills : now , what 's great about this is , there 's no trickery here .
there 's nothing done to this image .
and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does .
not only that , but as i move the object around , it 's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly .
now , this has applications everywhere , whether in things like art in museums , like you just saw , or in the world of , say , advertising , or print journalism .
voice : ... to the grass , and it 's very important that you adapt and you , you have to be flexible , you have to be willing to change direction at a split second , and she does all that . she 's won this title .
mm : and that linking of the digital content to something that 's physical is what we call an aura , and i 'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk .
so , what 's great about this is it is n't just a faster , more convenient way to get information in the real world , but there are times when actually using this medium allows you to be able to display information in a way that was never before possible .
so what i have here is a wireless router .
then connect the power . finally , the yellow ethernet cable .
congratulations . you have now completed setup .
( applause ) the incredible work that made that possible was done here in the u.k. by scientists at cambridge , and they work in our offices , and i 've got a lovely picture of them here .
tamara , would you like to jump in ?
( music ) ( dinosaur roaring ) ( laughter ) mm : i should leap in . ( music ) ( dinosaur roaring )
what 's great about this is , the tools to do this are free .
they 're open , they 're available to everyone within our application , and educators have really got on board with the classrooms .
child : oh , that is so cool .
teacher : and then , have you got it again ?
second child : it 's magic .
( laughter ) mm : ( laughs ) so , it 's not magic .
so , as sort of — i 'm told it 's called a stadium wave , so we 're going to start from this side of the room on the count of three , and go over to here .
okay , so are you all ready ?
audience : whooooooo !
on the emotional side , we have people who 've done things like send postcards and christmas cards back to their family with little messages on them .
we 're all very , very familiar with the internet .
in the last 20 years , it 's really changed the way that we live and work , and the way that we see the world , and what 's great is , we sort of think this is the next paradigm shift , because now we can literally take the content that we share , we discover , and that we enjoy and make it a part of the world around us .
it 's completely free to download this application .
oh , there we are . we can save it now .
it 's just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint , and the great thing is , if you 're a professional user , — so , a newspaper — the tools are pretty much identical to what we 've just used to create this demonstration .
mm : okay . so , i 'm told we 're ready , which means we can now point at the image , and there you all are .
mm on video : one , two , three . go !
mm : well done . we 've been aurasma . thank you .
( applause )
the problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that archie does n't really understand .
the symptoms are this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin .
he does n't know how to cure it .
and he 's operating in a hostile environment .
and people do terrible things in wars .
the german camp guards , they 've got bored .
they 've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random for fun .
on one particular occasion , one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners ' lavatory while it was full of prisoners .
so the situation seemed pretty desperate .
but archie cochrane was a resourceful person .
now some of you will be wondering what marmite is .
marmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the british .
it looks like crude oil .
it tastes ...
zesty .
he gives half of them vitamin b12 .
he has n't been able to shave — a sort of billy connolly figure .
and he ca n't understand how this barbarism can be tolerated , and he vents his frustrations .
and then he goes back to his quarters , breaks down and weeps because he 's convinced that the situation is hopeless .
i 'm not even telling you the story because i think we should be running more carefully controlled randomized trials in all aspects of public policy , although i think that would also be completely awesome .
i 'm telling you this story because archie cochrane , all his life , fought against a terrible affliction , and he realized it was debilitating to individuals and it was corrosive to societies .
and he had a name for it .
now i can describe the symptoms of the god complex very , very easily .
so the symptoms of the complex are , no matter how complicated the problem , you have an absolutely overwhelming belief that you are infallibly right in your solution .
and doctors suffer from the god complex a lot .
now i 'm an economist , i 'm not a doctor , but i see the god complex around me all the time in my fellow economists .
i see it in our business leaders .
and you know , with the future billions that we 've been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way .
imagine for a moment that , instead of tim harford in front of you , there was hans rosling presenting his graphs .
so three pieces of data for each country — three pieces of data .
he 's at mit .
cesar has trolled the database of over 5,000 different products , and he 's used techniques of network analysis to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products .
and it 's wonderful , wonderful work .
you show all these interconnections , all these interrelations .
cesar and i tried to write a piece for the new york times magazine explaining how this works .
and what we learned is cesar 's work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .
five thousand products — that 's still nothing . five thousand products —
in about the length of this session , you would have counted all 5,000 .
now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in walmart .
there are 100,000 there . it would take you all day .
it 's even more difficult in edinburgh because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan .
this is how complex the economy we 've created is .
and i 'm just counting toasters here .
i 'm not trying to solve the middle east problem .
this perhaps is why we find the god complex so tempting .
`` we tend to retreat and say , `` '' we can draw a picture , we can post some graphs , we get it , we understand how this works . '' '' and we do n't . ''
now i 'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here .
i 'm not trying to say we ca n't solve complicated problems in a complicated world .
we clearly can .
but the way we solve them is with humility — to abandon the god complex and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works .
and we have a problem-solving technique that works .
i realize that 's an ambiguous statement .
this baby is a human body : it evolved .
what is evolution ?
and it 's not just biological systems that produce miracles through trial and error .
you could use it in an industrial context .
so let 's say you wanted to make detergent .
you create a spray of detergent .
it falls to the floor .
you scoop it up . you put it in cardboard boxes .
you find yourself a mathematician ; you find yourself a physicist — somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid .
and he will , or she will , calculate the optimal design of the nozzle .
now unilever did this and it did n't work — too complicated .
but the geneticist professor steve jones describes how unilever actually did solve this problem — trial and error , variation and selection .
you try out all 10 ; you keep the one that works best .
you see how this works , right ?
and after 45 generations , you have this incredible nozzle .
it looks a bit like a chess piece — functions absolutely brilliantly .
and the moment you step back from the god complex — let 's just try to have a bunch of stuff ; let 's have a systematic way of determining what 's working and what 's not — you can solve your problem .
the u.s. economy is still the world 's greatest economy .
i could give you all kinds of facts and figures about the u.s. economy , but i think the most salient one is this : ten percent of american businesses disappear every year .
that is a huge failure rate .
ten percent of americans do n't disappear every year .
which leads us to conclude american businesses fail faster than americans , and therefore american businesses are evolving faster than americans .
i sometimes wonder .
obviously trial and error is very important .
obviously experimentation is very important .
you think it 's obvious ?
stop giving them lists of questions every single one of which has an answer .
and if you ca n't find the answers , you must be lazy or stupid .
i want to fix our education system .
i have no idea how to do it .
i have half a dozen ideas .
we 're going to test them out . they 'll probably all fail .
then we 'll test some other ideas out .
because it 's so hard to admit our own fallibility .
it 's so uncomfortable .
and archie cochrane understood this as well as anybody .
nevertheless , archie managed to get permission to do this .
`` and after the trial had been running for a little while , he gathered together all his colleagues around his table , and he said , `` '' well , gentlemen , we have some preliminary results . ''
and it turns out that you 're right and i 'm wrong .
it is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home .
but cochrane would do that kind of thing .
`` and the reason he would do that kind of thing is because he understood it feels so much better to stand there and say , `` '' here in my own little world , i am a god , i understand everything . ''
`` i do not want to have my conclusions tested . '' '' it feels so much more comfortable simply to lay down the law . ''
and you sometimes need to be shocked out of that .
it 's incredibly painful .
and since i started talking about this subject and researching this subject , i 've been really haunted by something a japanese mathematician said on the subject .
so shortly after the war , this young man , yutaka taniyama , developed this amazing conjecture called the taniyama-shimura conjecture .
in fact , it turns out it 's equivalent to proving fermat 's last theorem .
and shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958 , yutaka taniyama killed himself .
his friend , goro shimura — who worked on the mathematics with him — many decades later , reflected on taniyama 's life .
`` he said , `` '' he was not a very careful person as a mathematician . ''
but he made mistakes in a good direction .
( applause )
we do not invest in victims , we invest in survivors .
and in ways both big and small , the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women .
six years ago , i started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict .
none of the women i had grown up with in maryland had graduated from college , let alone considered business school .
but they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent .
i want to introduce you to some of those entrepreneurs i 've met and share with you some of what they 've taught me over the years .
business , she said , was critical to her country 's future .
`` and that 's really how i became an entrepreneur . '' '' think about this : here were girls who braved danger to become breadwinners during years in which they could n't even be on their streets . ''
and at a time of economic collapse when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors just to survive , these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many .
`` i went on to bosnia , and early on in my interviews i met with an imf official who said , `` '' you know , gayle , i do n't think we actually have women in business in bosnia , but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road . ''
and she was just the start .
i met women running essential oils businesses , wineries and even the country 's largest advertising agency .
the biases , whether intentional or otherwise , are pervasive , and so are the misleading mental images .
most people say women .
`` and if you see the word `` '' entrepreneur , '' '' most people think men . ''
they want to move from micro to medium and beyond .
and in many places , they 're there .
in the u.s. , women-owned businesses will create five and a half million new jobs by 2018 .
in south korea and indonesia , women own nearly half a million firms .
they are often ignored because they 're harder to help .
and as the world bank recently noted , women are stuck in a productivity trap .
recently i was at the state department in washington and i met an incredibly passionate entrepreneur from ghana .
she had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to africa , europe , the middle east and far beyond — capital that would help her to employ more than the 20 people that she already has working for her , and capital that would fuel her own country 's economic climb .
theory and empirical evidence have already taught us .
because — and i say this as somebody who worked in finance — 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade .
how wonderful would it be if we were prepared to replace all of our lofty words with our wallets and invest 500 billion dollars unleashing women 's economic potential ?
and not one country in all the world has eliminated its economic participation gap — not one .
we have so much room to grow .
so you see , this is not about doing good , this is about global growth and global employment .
it is about how we invest and it 's about how we see women .
first of all , for exceptions , there are a lot of them and they 're important .
and when we talk about women , they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to be ignored .
and finally , there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional .
so why would n't we celebrate and elevate these change makers and job creators rather than overlook them ?
this topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life .
my mom was a single mom who worked at the phone company during the day and sold tupperware at night so that i could have every opportunity possible .
we shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores , and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work , we even applied for food stamps .
`` and she told me , `` never import other people 's limitations . '' ''
the women in my family are not exceptions .
the women in this room and watching in l.a .
we are not a special interest group .
and for far too long , we have underestimated ourselves and been undervalued by others .
it is time for us to aim higher when it comes to women , to invest more and to deploy our dollars to benefit women all around the world .
we can make a difference , and make a difference , not just for women , but for a global economy that desperately needs their contributions .
together we can make certain that the so-called exceptions begin to rule .
thank you very much .
`` he said , `` '' i think the most important thing to happen in 2006 was that living and thinking green hit main street . ''
that would be the answer .
in 2001 , this building received an award .
it 's been well known that the dead sea is dying .
( applause )
so just bear with me . we 'll go real fast , you know ?
and people simply do not have enough to survive .
so what 's worldchanging ?
talk about the kinds of things we 're scoping out .
most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly .
one place we 're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones . right ?
and those things lead to things like this .
you know , brazilian music scene is n't just answering the major labels .
and it 's all about this question , in a very artistic and indirect kind of way .
here 's a fog-catcher , which , if you live in a moist , jungle-like area , will distill water from the air that 's clean and drinkable .
here 's a way of transporting water .
this is a merry-go-round invented by the company roundabout , which pumps water as kids play . you know ?
we believe in thinking differently .
a few years ago , gateway came out with flat-screen tvs .
`` our newest brain , our homo sapien brain , our neocortex , corresponds with the `` '' what '' '' level . ''
he was n't first , he did n't get rich , he did n't get famous , so he quit .
it 's because they wanted to be first .
in fact , people will do the things that prove what they believe .
they showed up for themselves .
we followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
because there are leaders and there are those who lead .
i 'm five years old , and i am very proud .
inside , it 's a smelly , gaping hole in the ground , but outside , it 's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun .
this makes me feel so proud , so important , that i appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and i devise missions for us .
so we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free .
she acquired a nurse 's uniform , and she snuck in every night to sit by my side .
five years later , an unexpected silver lining .
only , we do n't know that it 's a homeless shelter .
and in that moment , i feel like a millionaire .
and he tells us to pay , but we do n't speak english .
then our neighbor pops her head in , and she turns red with rage when she realizes that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza .
on our 10 year anniversary of being in the u.s. , we decided to celebrate by reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the u.s .
his family lost everything , and at age 11 , he had to live in motels with his dad , motels that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the bill .
and one time , when he finally got his box of frosted flakes back , it was crawling with roaches .
but he did have one thing .
once upon a time , scarlet was used as bait in dog fights .
sometimes brian and i walk through the park with scarlett , and she rolls through the grass , and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude .
( applause )
cities are the crucible of civilization .
they have been expanding , urbanization has been expanding , at an exponential rate in the last 200 years so that by the second part of this century , the planet will be completely dominated by cities .
two hundred years ago , the united states was less than a few percent urbanized .
it 's now more than 82 percent .
the planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago .
this is going to affect everything .
everybody in this room , if you stay alive , is going to be affected by what 's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon .
so we have this kind of dual nature .
( laughter ) so here 's the problem : this is what we all want .
the 10 billion people on the planet in 2050 want to live in places like this , having things like this , doing things like this , with economies that are growing like this , not realizing that entropy produces things like this , this , this and this .
and scientific theory means quantifiable — relying on underlying generic principles that can be made into a predictive framework .
that 's the quest .
is that conceivable ?
are there universal laws ?
the first is : are cities part of biology ?
is london a great big whale ?
is edinburgh a horse ?
we use them metaphorically — the dna of a company , the metabolism of a city , and so on — is that just bullshit , metaphorical bullshit , or is there serious substance to it ?
and if you have a serious theory , you should be able to predict when google is going to go bust .
that is , you ask any generic question about this — how many trees of a given size , how many branches of a given size does a tree have , how many leaves , what is the energy flowing through each branch , what is the size of the canopy , what is its growth , what is its mortality ?
we have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions .
and that is one of the main reasons life is so resilient and robust — scalability .
we 're going to discuss that in a moment more .
but you know , at a local level , you scale ; everybody in this room is scaled .
that 's called growth .
here 's how you grew .
and you see , you 're very familiar with this .
you grow very quickly and then you stop .
and here it is for the growth of a rat , and those points on there are data points .
and you see , it stops growing .
this is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us , particularly illustrated in that left-hand corner : hockey sticks .
so let 's first talk about biology .
what is plotted here is metabolic rate — how much energy you need per day to stay alive — versus your weight , your mass , for all of us bunch of organisms .
and it 's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10 , otherwise you could n't get everything on the graph .
and what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line .
despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe , there 's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this .
it 's particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms , each subsystem , each cell type , each gene , has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history .
and yet , despite all of that darwinian evolution and natural selection , they 've been constrained to lie on a line .
something else is going on .
before i talk about that , i 've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve , this straight line .
it says that , if it were linear , the steepest slope , then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy .
now any physiological variable you can think of , any life history event you can think of , if you plot it this way , looks like this .
there is an extraordinary regularity .
and the reason for this is because of networks .
and you 're very familiar with these networks .
and here 's the summary of what i 'm saying .
if you take those networks , this idea of networks , and you apply universal principles , mathematizable , universal principles , all of these scalings and all of these constraints follow , including the description of the forest , the description of your circulatory system , the description within cells .
heart rates are slower ; you live longer ; diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower , etc .
the question is : is any of this true for cities and companies ?
here 's just a symbolic picture of that .
that is that the number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size .
it scales in the same way everywhere .
and any infrastructure you look at — whether it 's the length of roads , length of electrical lines — anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way .
but even more surprising is if you look at socio-economic quantities , quantities that have no analog in biology , that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to 10,000 years ago .
and the bottom one is you lot — super-creatives plotted in the same way .
but most important in this , the exponent , the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate , is bigger than one — it 's about 1.15 to 1.2 .
here it is , which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita , unlike biology — higher wages , more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger , more patents per capita , more crime per capita .
and here , they 're all plotted together .
just to show you what we plotted , here is income , gdp — gdp of the city — crime and patents all on one graph .
and you can see , they all follow the same line .
and here 's the statement .
it goes up by 15 percent , and you have a 15 percent savings on the infrastructure .
this , no doubt , is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities .
because they think that all those wonderful things — like creative people , wealth , income — is what attracts them , forgetting about the ugly and the bad .
this 15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet — japan , chile , portugal , scotland , does n't matter .
something universal is going on .
the universality , to repeat , is us — that we are the city .
so there it is , i 've said it again .
so if it is those networks and their mathematical structure , unlike biology , which had sublinear scaling , economies of scale , you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger .
if it 's social networks with super-linear scaling — more per capita — then the theory says that you increase the pace of life .
the bigger you are , life gets faster .
on the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of european cities , showing that increase .
that would be bad for economies and cities .
and it 's destined to collapse for many reasons — kind of malthusian reasons — that you run out of resources .
and how do you avoid that ? well we 've done it before .
what we do is , as we grow and we approach the collapse , a major innovation takes place and we start over again , and we start over again as we approach the next one , and so on .
the catch , however , to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster .
so the image is that we 're not only on a treadmill that 's going faster , but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster .
we have to accelerate on a continuous basis .
and the question is : can we , as socio-economic beings , avoid a heart attack ?
so lastly , i 'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies .
see companies , they scale .
it 's the same plot .
we could use sales , anything you like .
there it is : after some little fluctuations at the beginning , when companies are innovating , they scale beautifully .
and i 'm only showing you a little bit of this .
in that interpretation , by bureaucracy and administration , and they do it beautifully , may i say .
so if you tell me the size of some company , some small company , i could have predicted the size of walmart .
there 's walmart . does n't look very sigmoidal .
that 's what we like , hockey sticks .
let 's go up to 2008 .
that red line is from the theory .
there they are . that 's 23,000 companies .
they all start looking like hockey sticks , they all bend over , and they all die like you and me .
thank you .
blah blah blah blah , blah blah , blah blah blah blah blah blah .
blah blah blah , blah .
so what the hell was that ?
well , you do n't know because you could n't understand it .
now , how many people know what this is ?
okay . thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius charles m. schulz , we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves create an entire emotional life , one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans for over 50 years .
`` there is no other typographic information or visual information on the front , and the name of the book is `` '' only what 's necessary . '' '' so this is sort of symbolic about the decisions i have to make every day about the design that i 'm perceiving , and the design i 'm creating . ''
clarity gets to the point .
`` we ask ourselves this . [ `` '' when should you be clear ? '' '' ] now , something like this , whether we can read it or not , needs to be really , really clear . ''
this is a rather recent example of urban clarity that i just love , mainly because i 'm always late and i am always in a hurry .
mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition .
mystery demands to be decoded , and when it 's done right , we really , really want to .
and the friends ' names each have a connotation in japanese to a color .
so i created this sort of abstract representation of this , but there 's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story , and there 's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket .
the four fingers are now four train lines in the tokyo subway system , which has significance within the story .
and then you have the colorless subway line intersecting with each of the other colors , which basically he does later on in the story .
he catches up with each of these people to find out why they treated him the way they did .
what does this mean ?
`` this is an approach i wanted to take to a book of essays by david sedaris that had this title at the time . [ `` '' all the beauty you will ever need '' '' ] now , the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing . ''
it came to the author 's boyfriend in a dream .
we 're just seeing this strange thing and we know we love david sedaris , and so we 're hoping that we 're in for a good time .
this led me to graffiti .
i 'm fascinated by graffiti .
i think anybody who lives in an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time , and there 's all different sorts of it .
`` now whether you look at this and think , `` '' oh , that 's a charming urban affectation , '' '' or you look at it and say , `` '' that 's illegal abuse of property , '' '' the one thing i think we can all agree on is that you can not read it . ''
there is another kind of graffiti that i find far more interesting , which i call editorial graffiti .
`` he is probably best known as the author of `` '' the black dahlia '' '' and `` '' l.a . confidential . '' '' his most recent novel was called this , which is a very mysterious name that i 'm sure a lot of people know what it means , but a lot of people do n't . ''
and it 's a story about a japanese-american detective in los angeles in 1941 investigating a murder .
i 'm going to go right into the slides .
and so then i put this big billboard behind it .
and so we finally ended up making it .
we used it at loyola on the chapel , and it did n't work .
this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries .
it 's up there .
it looks like i got a baldessari painting for free .
this is for michael eisner — disney .
if any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
i do n't understand why this keeps happening .
you 've got to date around .
`` and most importantly , true love will find you when you least expect it . '' '' now as it turns out , i 'm somebody who thinks a lot about data , as you 'll soon find . ''
so that was n't going to work .
i 'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36 , which was only four percent of the population , so now i 'm dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men .
so that basically meant there were 35 men for me that i could possibly date in the entire city of philadelphia .
so i decided to sign on .
but that actually was n't the biggest problem .
i talked a lot about javascript .
these algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates — what turned out to be truly awful dates .
and we went in , and right off the bat , our conversation really was n't taking flight , but he was ordering a lot of food .
so i said fine , i 've got a new plan .
these things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers .
who are all of the other women on these dating sites ?
i found smileygirl1978 .
remember , i 'm somebody who said that i speak fluent japanese and i know javascript and i was okay with that .
he made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
what they do is very similar to our creative process .
the reason for that is that everybody 's an expert on consciousness .
they 're just strongly held opinions .
how is that possible ? many people just think it is n't possible at all .
and there 's a passage in it which i would love to share with you .
how many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color ?
how do you know that 's what you did ?
can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?
because there 's another way of seeing it .
if you 're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles , some black circles , there 's another way of seeing it .
we do n't have any trouble seeing the cube , but where does the color change ?
and i supposed that that was just a flat truth , always true .
now , if you think you see some pale yellow — i 'll run this a few more times .
this one because it 's so large and yet it 's pretty hard to see .
thanks very much for your attention .
so it was taken for granted that i attend some of the best universities , which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity .
unfortunately , most of the people in the world are not so lucky .
in some parts of the world , for example , south africa , education is just not readily accessible .
in south africa , the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority .
and as a consequence , today there is just not enough spots for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education .
when the gates opened , there was a stampede , and 20 people were injured and one woman died .
what might not be quite as obvious to people is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition has been increasing at almost twice the rate , for a total of 559 percent since 1985 .
this makes education unaffordable for many people .
this , of course , is not true for the students who graduate from the top institutions , but for many others , they do not get the value for their time and their effort .
tom friedman , in his recent new york times article , captured , in the way that no one else could , the spirit behind our effort .
so to understand this , let 's look at one of those classes , the machine learning class offered by my colleague and cofounder andrew ng .
ezekiel emanuel : fifty million people are uninsured .
we get unbelievable segregation .
scott klemmer : so bush imagined that in the future , you 'd wear a camera right in the center of your head .
mitchell duneier : mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...
rg : hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine .
paul offit : ... vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus .
dan jurafsky : does lufthansa serve breakfast and san jose ? well , that sounds funny .
daphne koller : so this is which coin you pick , and this is the two tosses .
andrew ng : so in large-scale machine learning , we 'd like to come up with computational ...
since we opened the website in february , we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries .
whether it 's akash , who comes from a small town in india and would never have access in this case to a stanford-quality course and would never be able to afford it .
i 'm really glad to say — recently , we 've been in correspondence with ryan — that this story had a happy ending .
so what made these courses so different ?
after all , online course content has been available for a while .
it started on a given day , and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis and do homework assignments .
and these would be real homework assignments for a real grade , with a real deadline .
you can see the deadlines and the usage graph .
let 's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses .
you can break up the material , for example , into these short , modular units of eight to 12 minutes , each of which represents a coherent concept .
so , for example , some students might benefit from a little bit of preparatory material that other students might already have .
so this format allows us to break away from the one-size-fits-all model of education , and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum .
perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort is that we need to have students who practice with the material in order to really understand it .
for example , even our videos are not just videos .
( video ) sp : ... these four things . prospect theory , hyperbolic discounting , status quo bias , base rate bias . they 're all well documented .
so they 're all well documented deviations from rational behavior .
( laughter ) so they get to try again , and this time they got it right .
this is a kind of simple question that i as an instructor might ask in class , but when i ask that kind of a question in class , 80 percent of the students are still scribbling the last thing i said , 15 percent are zoned out on facebook , and then there 's the smarty pants in the front row who blurts out the answer before anyone else has had a chance to think about it , and i as the instructor am terribly gratified that somebody actually knew the answer .
here , every single student has to engage with the material .
one needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions , and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions .
in addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video , we can also grade math , mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations .
this is from stanford 's computer science 101 class , and the students are supposed to color-correct that blurry red image .
and so , the student tries again , and now they got it right , and they 're told that , and they can move on to the next assignment .
specifically , what 's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities , the social sciences , business and others .
so we tried to convince , for example , some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy .
that did n't go over really well .
it turns out that previous studies show , like this one by saddler and good , that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy for providing reproducible grades .
around each one of our courses , a community of students had formed , a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor .
what you see here is a self-generated map from students in our princeton sociology 101 course , where they have put themselves on a world map , and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort .
and the really amazing thing is , because there were so many students , it means that even if a student posed a question at 3 o'clock in the morning , somewhere around the world , there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem .
which is not a level of service i have ever offered to my stanford students .
students also self-assembled , without any kind of intervention from us , into small study groups .
so you can turn the study of human learning from the hypothesis-driven mode to the data-driven mode , a transformation that , for example , has revolutionized biology .
you can use these data to understand fundamental questions like , what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not ?
this is a distribution of wrong answers to one of andrew 's assignments .
the answers happen to be pairs of numbers , so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot .
each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer .
now , if two students in a class of 100 give the same wrong answer , you would never notice .
but when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer , it 's kind of hard to miss .
so andrew and his students went in , looked at some of those assignments , understood the root cause of the misconception , and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket , which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively .
the first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom .
so how do we do that ?
second , it would enable lifelong learning .
but what if we were smarter about how we designed satellites ?
( applause )
now , level 1 numeracy skills — that 's low-end gcse score .
it 's the ability to deal with fractions , percentages and decimals .
so can you guess what happened to this number ?
it went up to 49 .
`` but i preferred , actually , the reaction of a schoolchild when i presented at a school this information , who raised their hand and said , `` '' how do we know that the person who made that number is n't one of the 49 percent either ? '' '' ( laughter ) so clearly , there 's a numeracy issue , because these are important skills for life , and a lot of the changes that we want to introduce in this century involve us becoming more comfortable with numbers . ''
oecd this year released some figures looking at numeracy in young people , and leading the way , the usa — nearly 40 percent of young people in the us have low numeracy .
if you look at the far end of this graph , you can see the netherlands and korea are in single figures .
so there 's definitely a numeracy problem that we want to address .
now , as useful as studies like these are , i think we risk herding people inadvertently into one of two categories ; that there are two kinds of people : those people that are comfortable with numbers , that can do numbers , and the people who ca n't .
it 's not an immutable pairing .
but actually , i was a late convert to the world of statistics myself .
if you look at the etymology of the word statistics , it 's the science of dealing with data about the state or the community that we live in .
and i think as social animals , we share this fascination about how we as individuals relate to our groups , to our peers .
and there 's been some really wonderful surveys carried out recently by ipsos mori in the last few years .
so there 's this big variation between what we think , our perception , and the reality as given by statistics .
and they had every right to be angry , because in fact , i 'd have to have closer to 200 dots before i could color one in , in terms of what the official figures tell us .
and rather like numeracy , this is not just an english problem .
and so , they asked saudi arabians , for every 100 adults in your country , how many of them are overweight or obese ?
the official figures show , actually , it 's nearer to three-quarters .
( laughter ) so again , a big variation .
the official figure is seven .
so extraordinary variations , and surprising to some , but not surprising to people who have read the work of daniel kahneman , for example , the nobel-winning economist .
individual experiences , certainly , can influence our perceptions , but so , too , can things like the media reporting things by exception , rather than what 's normal .
and that has enormous repercussions for decision making .
so at the statistics office while this was all going on , i thought this was really interesting .
so i had an idea , which was to think about this same sort of approach but to think about it in a very local sense .
so i devised a quiz : how well do you know your area ?
and i was very conscious in designing this .
and the numbers are there , but they sit in the background .
and so because this is tedxexeter , i thought we would have a quick look at the quiz for the first few questions of exeter .
`` you drag the slider to highlight your icons , and then just click `` '' submit '' '' to answer , and we animate away the difference between your answer and reality . ''
and it turns out , i was a pretty terrible guess : five .
we 've had online applications that allow you to put in a post code and get statistics back for years .
it turns out , the reaction was , um ...
was more than i could have hoped for .
and that 's why we should be fascinated by numbers .
thank you very much .
although for two years , we were like prisoners at home .
my husband and i used to run an architecture studio in the old town main square .
since the ceasefire in late 2015 , large parts of homs have been more or less quiet .
the economy is completely broken , and people are still fighting .
when i look at my destroyed city , of course , i ask myself : what has led to this senseless war ?
they all have played their role .
and that reason is architecture .
they blew up city streets and relocated monuments .
they called them improvements , and they were the beginning of a long , slow unraveling .
`` conflict is much easier between pre-categorized areas — where the `` '' others '' '' live . ''
we have severely destroyed cities , such as homs , aleppo , daraa and many others , and almost half of the population of the country is now displaced .
what are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes ?
there is a neighborhood here in homs that 's called baba amr that has been fully destroyed .
architecture is not the axis around which all human life rotates , but it has the power to suggest and even direct human activity .
in that sense , settlement , identity and social integration are all the producer and product of effective urbanism .
in order for a place to give , its architecture should be giving , too .
we can learn from this .
thank you for listening .
that looks like a coastline .
and more than that , it 's engendering new kinds of change .
but they will have a dark side .
in fact , some years ago , bill joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over , etc .
we have to accept that there will be hazards .
ice cover waxed and waned .
successions of new species emerged , evolved and became extinct .
some journeyed to the moons and planets .
( applause )
today i 'm going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle , that you can carry with you anywhere , that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes , and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers on about a dollar of electricity .
but when i say the word electric vehicle , people think about vehicles . they think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles , and the vehicles that you use every day .
but if you come about it from a different perspective , you can create some more interesting , more novel concepts .
i 've got some of the pieces in my pocket here .
this motor has enough power to take you up the hills of san francisco at about 20 miles per hour , about 30 kilometers an hour , and this battery , this battery right here has about six miles of range , or 10 kilometers , which is enough to cover about half of the car trips in the u.s. alone .
so today we 're going to show you one example of how you can use this .
( music ) [ 6 mile range ] [ top speed near 20mph ] [ uphill climbing ] [ regenerative braking ] ( applause ) ( cheers ) so we 're going to show you what this thing can do .
it 's incredible just how light this thing is .
i mean , this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go .
so i 'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles .
they 're demographics , education , debt and inequality .
then growth gets better and better .
what about the electronic revolution ?
so for example , have you ever noticed how some people get bitten by mosquitos way more often than others ?
we have n't demonstrated this in humans yet but maybe it 's just a matter of time before we find out . ( laughter ) so microbes are performing a huge range of functions .
they help educate our immune system .
well , it would n't look exactly like this , but it 's a helpful guide for understanding biodiversity .
different parts of the world have different landscapes of organisms that are immediately characteristic of one place or another or another .
and what it turns out to be is that those , as the different regions of the body , have very different microbes in them .
so you probably heard that we 're pretty much all the same in terms of our human dna .
so how do they do all this stuff ?
well , it depends on what you think of as our bodies .
is it our cells ?
so they outnumber us 10 to one .
now , you might think , well , we 're human because of our dna , but it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes , depending on what you count exactly , but as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes .
so babies that come out the regular way , all of their microbes are basically like the vaginal community , whereas babies that are delivered by c-section , all of their microbes instead look like skin .
and you 've seen children develop physically .
so what we are going to look at is we 're going to look at this one baby 's stool , the fecal community , which represents the gut , sampled every week for almost two and a half years .
and you can see he 's starting to approach the adult fecal community .
but something amazing is about to happen here .
the implication is that microbes can affect mammalian behavior .
so you might be wondering whether we can also do this sort of thing across species , and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person and transplant them into mice you 've raised germ-free , those mice will also become fatter than if they received the microbes from a lean person , but we can design a microbial community that we inoculate them with that prevents them from gaining this weight .
so , a couple of years ago , we started this project called american gut , which allows you to claim a place for yourself on this microbial map .
we also release them , de-identified , to scientists , to educators , to interested members of the general public , and so forth , so anyone can have access to the data .
on the other hand , when we do tours of our lab at the biofrontiers institute , and we explain that we use robots and lasers to look at poop , it turns out that not everyone wants to know .
so why might we want to do this ?
well , it turns out that microbes are not just important for finding out where we are in terms of our health , but they can actually cure disease .
this is one of the newest things we 've been able to visualize with colleagues at the university of minnesota .
so here 's that map of the human microbiome again .
what we 're looking at now — i 'm going to add in the community of some people with c. diff .
would the good microbes do battle with the bad microbes and help to restore their health ?
so let 's watch exactly what happens there .
he was saving lives with this machine .
with that guy 's data ?
happily , we 're not machines , and we can do it .
ab : 1824 , ok .
oh , i did this row already .
now , let me recap .
but , i know myself too , i feel this virtual esprit de corps , if you will , with all of them .
i 'm mckenna pope . i 'm 14 years old , and when i was 13 , i convinced one of the largest toy companies , toymakers , in the world , hasbro , to change the way that they marketed one of their most best-selling products .
so allow me to tell you about it .
he wanted to be a chef really badly .
in the commercials , and on the boxes for the easy-bake ovens , hasbro marketed them specifically to girls .
and the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials , and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens and it would be in bright pink and purple , very gender-specific colors to females , right ?
and this got me thinking , god , i wish there was a way that i could change this , that could i have my voice heard by hasbro so i could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it .
change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks , through facebook , through twitter , through youtube , through reddit , through tumblr , through whatever you can think of .
so this petition started to take off — humongously fast , you have no idea .
i was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets , and it was amazing .
it was literally one of the best moments of my life .
`` it was like `` '' willy wonka and the chocolate factory . '' '' that thing was amazing . ''
so , let 's see .
`` how about from whiteboy77ags : `` people always need something to ( female dog ) about . '' ''
`` from jeffrey gutierrez : `` omg , shut up . you just want money and attention . '' ''
so it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because i thought , people do n't care , people think it 's a waste of time , and people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family .
it hurt me , and it made me think , what 's the point of making change in the future ?
but then i started to realize something .
come on , say it with me . one , two , three : haters gon na hate .
you can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it .
and that spark that you 've been hearing about all day today , you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire .
and we 've been studying the evolution of this system .
really quick syllabus .
the two groups are not talking to each other .
i 'm going to try to go through 12 , really quickly .
back to that shell : the shell is a self-assembling material .
color without pigments : this peacock is creating color with shape .
and we use all of them , even the toxic ones .
they can be put in a glove compartment , ok .
ok , so that 's the healing one .
sensing and responding : feedback is a huge thing .
this is a huge and important one , number 11 .
and really , that 's what other organisms do as well .
i 'd like you to come back with me for a moment to the 19th century , specifically to june 24 , 1833 .
an elderly , white-haired man stands up .
they 're even more shocked by what he says .
coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs .
he politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist .
what were scientists called before ?
what had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment ?
prior to this meeting , those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs .
think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils , like charles darwin , for example , or , the hired help of a nobleman , like joseph priestley , who was the literary companion to the marquis of lansdowne when he discovered oxygen .
these were brilliant , driven men who accomplished amazing things .
john herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere , and , in his spare time , co-invented photography .
richard jones became an important economist who later influenced karl marx .
and whewell not only coined the term scientist , as well as the words anode , cathode and ion , but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides .
in the cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813 , the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts .
it was time for a new revolution , which they pledged to bring about , and what 's so amazing about these guys is , not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams , but they actually carried them out , even beyond their wildest dreams .
however , in 1809 , david ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different , deductive method .
the problem was that an influential group at oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics , this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too .
the members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed .
for example , ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports .
harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains .
in the days before pocket calculators , the numbers that most professionals needed — bankers , insurance agents , ship captains , engineers — were to be found in lookup books like this , filled with tables of figures .
these tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part-time workers known as — and this is amazing — computers , but these calculations were really difficult .
i mean , this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year .
babbage 's difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables .
it was capable of iteration , conditional branching and parallel processing , and it was programmable using punched cards , an idea babbage took from jacquard 's loom .
[ new scientific institutions ] founded in bacon 's time , the royal society of london was the foremost scientific society in england and even in the rest of the world .
by the 19th century , it had become a kind of gentleman 's club populated mainly by antiquarians , literary men and the nobility .
these new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results .
members were encouraged to bring their wives , daughters and sisters to the meetings of the british association , and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one , they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well .
the british association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members .
[ external funding for science ] up to the 19th century , natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies .
on the advice of the philosophical breakfast club , the british association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy , the tides , fossil fish , shipbuilding , and many other areas .
eventually , the royal society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit , and this has become — fortunately it 's become — a major part of the scientific landscape today .
they did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution .
thank you .
everyone i met , i felt i knew them for as long as i could remember .
this is where it began .
this is a police photo . that 's actually my car .
and the situation is that a car full of paramedics on their way home from the hospital after work have run across the wreckage , and they 've advised the police that there were no survivors inside the car , that the driver 's dead , that i 'm dead .
and when they do , they find that behind the glass , they find me .
and my skull 's crushed and my collar bone is crushed ; all but two of my ribs , my pelvis and both arms — they 're all crushed , but there is still a pulse .
and if you look , you 'll see that there 's only one way you can score three .
it 's essentially there 's no sign of life from outside at all .
now to put this into a broader context , i want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien watching the earth from outer space , and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television is the earth channel , and your favorite show is the human show .
and this is how we began .
the show began with tremendous special effects , because there were catastrophic climate shifts — which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today .
now you also continue to watch as consciousness evolved to the point that here in india , in madhya pradesh , there 's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found .
and the reason it connects us with consciousness today is that all of us still today , the very first shape we draw as a child is a circle .
there 's the egyptian god horus , which symbolizes prosperity , wisdom and health .
and that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the united states , which has on it an eye of providence .
until it was stripped from me , i never thought about it .
each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation , which means that india , unless something changes , is accumulating a need for millennia of rehabilitation .
all of these represent gaps between potential mind and actual mind .
our children are becoming depressed at an alarming rate .
if you look at some of these other items — concussions .
half of e.r . admissions from adolescents are for concussions .
we 're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation when we are potentially confronting the next great catastrophic climate shift .
so what you 'd be wondering , watching the human show , is are we going to confront and address the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way by growing our consciousness , or are we going to continue to retreat ?
and that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of cedars-sinai medical center and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind .
it 's not my eeg at cedars ; it 's your eeg tonight and last night .
this is how i was when i returned from the hospital after nearly four months .
the horseshoe shape you can see on my skull is where they operated and went inside my brain to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life .
i 'm not able to follow a line of text in a book .
but the system has moved me on because , as my family started to discover , there is no long-term concept in the health care system .
that is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain being destroyed by the stroke .
so my family , as we moved forward and discovered that the health care system had moved us by , had to try to find solutions and answers .
and during that process — it took many years — one of the doctors said that my recovery , my degree of advance , since the amount of head injury i 'd suffered , was miraculous .
the first c is cognitive training .
unlike the smashed glass of my car , plasticity of the brain means that there was always a possibility , with treatment , to train the brain so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness .
indeed , the mind can redefine itself , and this is demonstrated by two specialists called hagen and silva back in the 1970 's .
the global perspective is that up to 30 percent of children in school have learning weaknesses that are not self-correcting , but with appropriate treatment , they can be screened for and detected and corrected and avoid their academic failure .
but what i discovered is it 's almost impossible to find anyone who provides that treatment or care .
full-scale i.q . is the mental processing — how fast you can acquire information , retain it and retrieve it — that is essential for success in life today .
and you can see here there are three columns .
untestable — that 's when i 'm in my coma .
in the health care system , if you touch average , you 're done .
it meant that when i was given two and a half hours to take a test that anyone here would take in 50 minutes , i might score an f .
but they felt the evidences that there was important , valuable information in the book , and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it .
`` but they asked one question . they said , `` '' is this repeatable ? '' '' that was a fair question because my memoir was simply how i found solutions that worked for me . ''
and here 's another person in , call it , high school and college .
and this person is particularly interesting .
i wo n't go into the intrascatter that 's in the subtests , but they still had a neurologic issue .
but that person could be identified as having a learning disability .
and with accommodation , they went on to college and had a full life in terms of their opportunities .
the craniomandibular system is critical to that .
this affected my entire body .
that 's why the same between the before and after that this shows , it 's hard to see the difference .
there 's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it , and around that pipe are the nerves drawing their nutrient supply from the blood .
that 's basically it .
this is a level of pain that 's only known to other people who suffer vascular migraines .
using this technology , this is mapping in three dimensions .
a vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body .
and here , by great fortune , one of my father 's clients had a husband who worked at the alfred mann foundation for scientific research .
and i 'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed .
i 've brought with me , from southern california , the fm device .
it weighs less than a gram .
five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin .
the main unit will then go inside the brain .
is this science fiction ? no , because i 'm wearing the first application of this technology .
a radio device is controlling every step i take , and a sensor picks up my foot for me every time i walk .
in my coma , one of the presences i sensed was someone i felt was a protector .
and the following morning , my mother came to explain that i 'd not always been in this bed , in this room , that i 'd been working in film and television and that i had been in a crash and that , yes , i was married , but marcy had been killed instantly in the crash .
i believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness , that the human show can stay on the air for millennia to come .
thank you very much .
and he was walking around .
i did n't expect that person that i was going to meet to be him .
the thing that amazed me is the painstaking detail with which he has written every hospital he has been to , every treatment he got , every near-miss he had , and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations .
simon lewis : i knew when i was timing this that there would n't be time for me to do anything about — well this is it . this is the control unit .
that little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on .
when i press it again , it 'll chirp three times , and that 'll mean that it 's armed and ready to go .
and it works . it works .
and what i would love to add because i did n't have time ...
what does it do ? well actually , i 'll show you down here .
underneath my heel , there is a sensor that detects when my foot leaves the ground — what 's called the heel lift .
this thing blinks all the time ; i 'll leave it out , so you might be able to see it .
but this is blinking all the time . it 's sending signals in real time .
and it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation .
but there 's millions of deaf people in the world , and the cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now .
and the other thing is they 're working on artificial retinas for the blind .
because the first generation is exoskeletal , it 's wrapped around the leg , around the affected limb .
i must tell you , they 're an amazing — there 's a hundred people who work in that building — engineers , scientists , and other team members — all the time .
alfred mann has set up this foundation to advance this research because he saw there 's no way venture capital would come in for something like this .
he 's done a lot of very cutting-edge science .
thank you . thank you .
( applause )
that 's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement , filled with cans of food and water .
instead , it looks like this .
not missiles , but microbes .
now , part of the reason for this is that we 've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents .
but we 've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic .
we 're not ready for the next epidemic .
let 's look at ebola .
i followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication .
and as you look at what went on , the problem was n't that there was a system that did n't work well enough , the problem was that we did n't have a system at all .
in fact , there 's some pretty obvious key missing pieces .
the case reports came in on paper .
we did n't have a medical team ready to go .
and a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers .
there was no one there to look at treatment approaches .
as an example , we could have taken the blood of survivors , processed it , and put that plasma back in people to protect them .
there 's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go , they move in , they save the day , but that 's just pure hollywood .
the failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than ebola let 's look at the progression of ebola over this year .
about 10,000 people died , and nearly all were in the three west african countries .
the first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers .
the second is the nature of the virus .
ebola does not spread through the air .
and by the time you 're contagious , most people are so sick that they 're bedridden .
if it had gotten into a lot more urban areas , the case numbers would have been much larger .
so next time , we might not be so lucky .
the source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like ebola , or it could be bioterrorism .
so there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse .
so this is a serious problem .
but in fact , we can build a really good response system .
we have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they 're moving .
we have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen .
and we need preparedness .
do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies ?
what are the key pieces ?
first , we need strong health systems in poor countries .
taking advantage of the military 's ability to move fast , do logistics and secure areas .
the world bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic , global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars and we 'd have millions and millions of deaths .
so i think this should absolutely be a priority .
thank you .
( applause )
you have no limitations , basically .
so is everything lost ? well , maybe not .
pieces of rocks landed on the earth .
but that also means that we can go to mars and try to find traces of our own origin .
but for that to happen , mars needed to be habitable at the time when conditions were right .
so was mars habitable ?
i am using it a little bit differently .
what are the signatures of life ?
but when we get to the summit , we actually find the lake we came for .
but this picture is very deceiving .
anywhere on earth , 11 is considered to be extreme .
it would be a different type of life .
this can be our legacy , but only if we dare to explore .
i 've worked in broadcast .
and i wanted to do a piece about hunger .
now , i knew i could n't make people feel hungry , but maybe i could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical .
until one day she came back to my office and she was bawling , she was just crying .
so here 's the real line . you can see how long it was , right ?
voice : ok , he 's having a seizure .
like , that guy is at his feet .
and even though , through his peripheral vision , he can see that he 's in this lab space , he should be able to see that he 's not actually on the street , but he feels like he 's there with those people .
`` things like , `` '' it 's so real , '' '' `` '' absolutely believable , '' '' or , of course , the one that i was excited about , `` '' a real feeling as if you were in the middle of something that you normally see on the tv news . '' '' so , it works , right ? this stuff works . ''
and it does n't really matter where you 're from or what age you are — it 's really evocative .
now , do n't get me wrong — i 'm not saying that when you 're in a piece you forget that you 're here .
but it turns out we can feel like we 're in two places at once .
we can have what i call this duality of presence , and i think that 's what allows me to tap into these feelings of empathy .
and interestingly , we broke some news with this story .
they were lying on the floor laughing .
we 're all kind of with her . i have no idea .
it literally is that basic a way of making a sound .
you could be stamping on somebody , it 's having the same effect .
nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh .
and wherever you find it , it 's associated with interactions .
so i 'm going to play you a couple of those .
so is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter ?
you 're learning about laughter throughout your entire early adult life .
ice .
and now they 're all off .
we 're going to be okay .
and in fact , all of us are doing this all the time .
it 's not something specific to humans — it 's a really ancient behavior which really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better .
when i was 15 in 2005 , i completed high school and i moved from canada — saskatoon — to zawiya , my parents ' hometown in libya , a very traditional city .
and i found myself in conversation after conversation with classmates and colleagues , professors , friends , even relatives , beginning to question my own role and my own aspirations .
we would n't be here if it were n't for her .
so why were n't we learning about her ?
and there 's this amazing thing that happens in war , a cultural shift almost , very temporary .
we were n't holding hands or a medium .
we were part of decision making .
and i wanted and needed for that change to be permanent .
i used scripture .
policies were changed .
so really , the united nations just copied us .
but we have to be at the table .
it is not easy , challenging distorted religious messaging .
but we have to do it .
we have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights , the principles of our faith , not for us , not for the women in your families , not for the women in this room , not even for the women out there , but for societies that would be transformed with the participation of women .
and the only way we can do that , our only option , is to be , and remain , at the table .
that 's it . that 's enough .
i love you all . you 're wonderful .
it 'll render the human condition radically different from what it is today .
therefore you will do well to act on the side , no matter how far into the laboratory you may go , to serve as teachers during the span of your career .
if you are a bit short in mathematical skills , do n't worry .
many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi-literate .
i found out that in science and all its applications , what is crucial is not that technical ability , but it is imagination in all of its applications .
you may have heard the military dictum for the gathering of armies : march to the sound of the guns .
and i thank you for having me here tonight .
the boy is petting the elephant .
that 's a big airplane .
fei-fei li : this is a three-year-old child describing what she sees in a series of photos .
she might still have a lot to learn about this world , but she 's already an expert at one very important task : to make sense of what she sees .
our society is more technologically advanced than ever .
we send people to the moon , we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like .
yes , we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves , but without smart vision , they can not really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag on the road , which can be run over , and a rock that size , which should be avoided .
security cameras are everywhere , but they do not alert us when a child is drowning in a swimming pool .
`` `` '' why is this so hard ? '' '' you may ask . ''
just like to hear is not the same as to listen , to take pictures is not the same as to see , and by seeing , we really mean understanding .
in fact , it took mother nature 540 million years of hard work to do this task , and much of that effort went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains , not the eyes themselves .
you and i weave together entire stories of people , places and things the moment we lay our gaze on them .
how hard can this be ?
now you have to add another shape and viewpoint to the object model .
so about eight years ago , a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking .
no one tells a child how to see , especially in the early years .
they learn this through real-world experiences and examples .
if you consider a child 's eyes as a pair of biological cameras , they take one picture about every 200 milliseconds , the average time an eye movement is made .
so by age three , a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world .
so instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms , my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences in both quantity and quality .
some very friendly colleagues advised me to do something more useful for my tenure , and we were constantly struggling for research funding .
once , i even joked to my graduate students that i would just reopen my dry cleaner 's shop to fund imagenet .
in both quantity and quality , this was an unprecedented scale .
we were thrilled to have put together imagenet , and we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it , so in the ted fashion , we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free .
it takes input from other nodes and sends output to others .
moreover , these hundreds of thousands or even millions of nodes are organized in hierarchical layers , also similar to the brain .
that 's an enormous model .
powered by the massive data from imagenet and the modern cpus and gpus to train such a humongous model , the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected .
this is like a small child learning to utter a few nouns .
soon , another developmental milestone will be hit , and children begin to communicate in sentences .
a large airplane sitting on top of an airport runway .
( video ) computer : a cat lying on a bed in a blanket .
( video ) computer : a young boy is holding a baseball bat .
( video ) computer : a person sitting at a table with a cake .
what the computer does n't see is that this is a special italian cake that 's only served during easter time .
this is my son leo .
when machines can see , doctors and nurses will have extra pairs of tireless eyes to help them to diagnose and take care of patients .
cars will run smarter and safer on the road .
little by little , we 're giving sight to the machines .
first , we teach them to see .
then , they help us to see better .
how do you get around it , though ?
and what happens next ?
well , the internet has empowered us .
and technology has set us free — this is free wifi .
we took them away from their newspaper for three days .
four years ago today , exactly , actually , i started a fashion blog called style rookie .
`` my name 's tavi gevinson , and the title of my talk is `` '' still figuring it out , '' '' and the ms paint quality of my slides was a total creative decision in keeping with today 's theme , and has nothing to do with my inability to use powerpoint . ( laughter ) so i edit this site for teenage girls . i 'm a feminist . ''
but they 're not strong characters who happen to be female .
the problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand , and women are mad at themselves for not being that simple , when , in actuality , women are complicated , women are multifaceted — not because women are crazy , but because people are crazy , and women happen to be people . ( laughter ) so the flaws are the key .
i 'm not the first person to say this .
`` congrats , guys . ( laughs ) but i do n't feel that — i still feel that there are some types of women who are not represented that way , and one group that we 'll focus on today are teens , because i think teenagers are especially contradictory and still figuring it out , and in the '90s there was `` '' freaks and geeks '' '' and `` '' my so-called life , '' '' and their characters , lindsay weir and angela chase , i mean , the whole premise of the shows were just them trying to figure themselves out , basically , but those shows only lasted a season each , and i have n't really seen anything like that on tv since . ''
i was ending middle school , starting high school — i 'm a sophomore now — and i was trying to reconcile all of these differences that you 're told you ca n't be when you 're growing up as a girl .
you ca n't be smart and pretty .
you ca n't care about clothes if it 's not for the sake of what other people , usually men , will think of you .
became easier once i understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion , a conversation , a process , and this is a spread from a zine that i made last year when i — i mean , i think i 've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since .
but , yeah .
so i said on my blog that i wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing , their photography , whatever , to be a member of our staff .
and this is an excerpt from my first editor 's letter , where i say that rookie , we do n't have all the answers , we 're still figuring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and rookie , i think we 've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
`` i mean , we have articles called `` on taking yourself seriously : how to not care what people think of you , '' but we also have articles like , oops — i 'm figuring it out ! ''
so what i you to take away from my talk , the lesson of all of this , is to just be stevie nicks .
thank you . ( applause )
after climbing a steep hill and wiping the sweat from his brow , he described what he saw beneath him .
if everything had been labeled , nothing would have been visible .
now we 've got momentum . this is the tipping point .
this robot uses onboard sensors , cameras and laser scanners , to scan the environment .
what i want to show you next is a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory , where this robot was able to go for longer distances .
the first problem is it 's pretty big .
and this makes for a very short mission life .
and we invented the flying phone .
and it can travel up to six meters per second .
this is probably the first planned mid-air collision , at one-twentieth normal speed .
these are going at a relative speed of two meters per second , and this illustrates the basic principle .
the basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups , or swarms .
so , similarly , in our lab , we try to create artificial robot swarms .
so this video illustrates the basic idea .
so again , it 's not because all the robots know where they 're supposed to go .
and this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity .
they 're asked to form a circular shape , and no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation , or how many robots you pull out , each robot is simply reacting to its neighbor .
most of the land that we can cultivate has already been cultivated .
so what can robots do ?
but there is a new , technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value , and it 's called the blockchain .
now , that 's a pretty bold statement , but if you take nothing else away from this talk , i actually want you to remember that while blockchain technology is relatively new , it 's also a continuation of a very human story , and the story is this .
`` he passed away at the end of 2015 , but north pioneered what 's called `` '' new institutional economics . '' '' and what he meant by institutions were really just formal rules like a constitution , and informal constraints , like bribery . ''
we had some informal constraints in place , but we enforced all of our trade with violence or social repercussions .
so what is the blockchain ?
blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer-to-peer network .
it 's basically a public registry of who owns what and who transacts what .
this creates an immutable , unforgeable record of all of the transactions across this network .
this record is replicated on every computer that uses the network .
i think it 's closest in description to something like wikipedia .
so let 's take the first example , not knowing who we 're dealing with .
say i want to buy a used smartphone on ebay .
do they have great reviews and ratings , or do they have no profile at all ?
blockchains allow for us to create an open , global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source .
having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and the digital world means we can do all kinds of human trade in a totally new way .
i want some degree of transparency .
it 's a shared database , and even though it has multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time , it has one single truth .
so we can create that using blockchains .
what if you do n't send me the smartphone ?
blockchains allow us to write code , binding contracts , between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer .
so if we look at the smartphone example , you could think about escrow .
so rather than all of our uncertainties slowing us down and requiring institutions like banks , our governments , our corporations , we can actually harness all of that collective uncertainty and use it to collaborate and exchange more and faster and more open .
and one of the reasons is that it 's not just an economic evolution .
bettina warburg : i think that 's a really good question .
bw : thanks .
it 's the idea that if you see a problem , you work to fix it , and not just complain about it .
and so it 's no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government .
so keep that in mind .
so what does civic hacking look like ?
( applause )
most of us think of motion as a very visual thing .
and if we used the same software on the right video , it lets us see each breath that this infant takes , and we can use this as a contact-free way to monitor her breathing .
so a couple years ago , i started working with the folks that created that software , and we decided to pursue a crazy idea .
those vibrations are just usually too subtle and too fast for us to see .
that 's one ten-thousandth of a centimeter , which spans somewhere between a hundredth and a thousandth of a pixel in this image .
so you can squint all you want , but motion that small is pretty much perceptually invisible .
`` ( music : `` '' mary had a little lamb '' '' ) ( applause ) so how is this possible ? ''
how can we get so much information out of so little motion ?
and so a lot of our early experiments looked like this .
mary had a little lamb ! little lamb ! little lamb !
and this is what things sounded like from inside , next to the bag of chips .
( audio ) mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , that lamb was sure to go .
we push and pull and poke and prod things .
and that 's something that video still wo n't let us do , at least not traditionally .
so there 's nothing special about this camera .
in fact , i 've actually done this with my cell phone before .
so that 's it : just five seconds of regular video , while we bang on this surface , and we 're going to use the vibrations in that video to learn about the structural and material properties of our object , and we 're going to use that information to create something new and interactive .
i never got to meet him .
he perished in the holocaust .
it was printed in 1983 by chuck hull , who invented 3d printing .
you all know your shoe size .
how many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples ?
when i met amanda for the first time , she could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist down , but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable .
it was n't made to measure .
and we did . we built her an amazing suit .
it does n't stop there .
and as we sit here today , you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners , or your dental restorations .
good for g.e. , right ?
google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone , the ara .
a real moonshot , powered by 3d printing .
what if we could , for the first time , make incredible delectables like this beautiful ted teddy here , that are edible ?
many people think that 3d printing will be the end of manufacturing as we know it .
that will take new tools .
so many people ask me , will we have a 3d printer in every home ?
i think it 's the wrong question to ask .
now , these are not my grandfather 's shoes .
( applause )
last year , i went on my first book tour .
i 'm not multinational .
how can a human being come from a concept ?
my parents came from countries that did n't exist when they were born .
speaking with colum mccann that day , the penny finally dropped .
`` `` '' all identity is experience , '' '' i thought . ''
`` `` '' i 'm not a national , '' '' i proclaimed onstage . ''
`` `` i 'm a local . i 'm multi-local . '' ''
my experience is where i 'm from .
adichie 's dangerous single story , the myth of the nation of france ?
so , where are you a local ?
what kind of rituals are these ?
where do they occur ?
`` `` '' r '' '' number one , rituals . ''
now , think of your relationships , of the people who shape your days .
`` `` '' r '' '' number two , relationships . ''
so let 's try it .
his parents , born in nigeria , came to germany on scholarships .
my question really is , where is all the female superhero stuff ?
where are the costumes ? where are the toys ?
it 's , in short , how we learn what we know about other people and about the world .
how big of a problem ?
i 'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from malawi , eileen piri .
my uncle , my aunt , my brother or sister , can not force me to marry .
i 'll marry when i want .
sometimes , they would share clothes , and even shoes .
not only did it hurt her , even me .
i was going through a hard time as well .
in these initiation camps , you are taught how to sexually please a man .
imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day .
for my little sister , she ended up being pregnant .
a hard thing to change , but a good thing to try .
it was very hard , but we pushed .
( applause ) in my community , that was the first time a community , they had to call the bylaws , the first bylaw that protected girls in our community .
we did not stop there .
now , in malawi , 18 is the legal marriage age , from 15 to 18 .
we can do more .
girls face issues , difficult issues , at the community level every day .
male advocates , they have to jump in , to step in and work together .
i 'd like to take you on the epic quest of the rosetta spacecraft .
in the center of this cloud , our sun formed and ignited .
and they then become the comets as we see them in the sky .
we are only 20 , 30 , 40 kilometers away from the comet .
so what 's important to remember ?
so it 's a very fresh comet .
rosetta made a few historic firsts .
normally , you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are .
we recognized features — boulders , craters — and that 's how we know where we are respective to the comet .
here you see in white the trajectory , and the way this works .
on the way there , we flew by earth and we took a few pictures to test our cameras .
that 's one of the cameras on the lander , and it just looks under the solar arrays , and you see the planet mars and the solar array in the distance .
we were going 2,800 kilometers an hour faster than the comet , so we had to brake .
we had to do eight maneuvers , and you see here , some of them were really big .
but we had one hope : maybe it was smooth .
so we went through this process , and we mapped the comet .
we used a technique called photoclinometry .
from the shadow , we , with our brain , can immediately determine roughly what the shape of that rock is .
we did n't have more .
we had 60 days , and that was it .
let me quickly take you through some of the science and the instruments .
i wo n't bore you with all the details of all the instruments , but it 's got everything .
the bottom graph is september of last year .
two dust particles : the right one they call boris , and they shot it with tantalum in order to be able to analyze it .
of course , one of the important elements is the imaging .
this is one of the cameras of rosetta , the osiris camera , and this actually was the cover of science magazine on january 23 of this year .
now we know these from mars , but this comet does n't have an atmosphere , so it 's a bit difficult to create a wind-blown shadow .
we do n't know , so there is a lot to investigate .
here , you see the same image twice .
on the right-hand side , if you carefully look , there are three jets coming out of the bottom of that pit .
there is a very intriguing crack in the neck of the comet .
you see it on the right-hand side .
but much the same as rosetta , and that is because you want to compare what you find in space with what you find on the comet .
these are called ground truth measurements .
on the top right , you see an image taken at 60 meters by the lander , 60 meters above the surface of the comet .
so this is one of the last images we took before we landed on the comet .
here , you see the whole sequence again , but from a different perspective , and you see three blown-ups from the bottom-left to the middle of the lander traveling over the surface of the comet .
the only problem with the after image is , there is no lander .
that was discarded because it was way too expensive .
this is one of the iconic images of rosetta .
it 's a man-made object , a leg of the lander , standing on a comet .
the blue area here is where we know it must be .
we have n't been able to find it yet , but the search is continuing , as are our efforts to start getting the lander to work again .
the bbc was interviewing me , and another tv crew who was following me all day were filming me being interviewed , and it went on like that for the whole day .
with this image of the comet , i would like to leave you .
well , i 'm afraid i used to be the cat .
hello . i would like to start my talk with actually two questions , and the first one is : how many people here actually eat pig meat ?
please raise your hand — oh , that 's a lot .
and how many people have actually seen a live pig producing this meat ?
and well , of course , the dutch ca n't eat all these pigs .
a lot goes to the u.k. , germany .
and i spent about three years researching .
and in these years , i met all kinds people like , for instance , farmers and butchers , which seems logical .
but i also met aluminum mold makers , ammunition producers and all kinds of people .
and it consists of seven chapters — the chapters are skin , bones , meat , internal organs , blood , fat and miscellaneous .
so what they do is they put gelatin back in , in order to retain the texture .
fine bone china — this is a real classic .
of course , the bone in fine-bone china gives it its translucency and also its strength , in order to make these really fine shapes , like this deer .
in interior decorating , the pig 's actually quite there .
in sandpaper , bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper .
and what it is — it 's actually steak .
so , this is sold as cow , but what happens when you slaughter a cow — at least in industrial factory farming — they have all these little bits of steak left that they ca n't actually sell as steak , so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage , then freeze the sausage , cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again .
so , with the steak , you might drink a beer .
there 's actually a company in greece that produces these cigarettes that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter .
( laughter ) so , this is actually a healthier cigarette . ( laughter )
this is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the united states .
and while i was making the book , i contacted all the producers of products because i wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens .
`` so i sent this company an email saying , `` '' hello . i 'm christien . i 'm doing this research . ''
`` and can you send me a bullet ? '' '' ( laughter ) and well , i did n't expect them to even answer my email . ''
`` but they answered and they said , `` '' why , thank you for your email . what an interesting story . ''
`` are you in anyway related to the dutch government ? '' '' i thought that was really weird , as if the dutch government sends emails to anyone . ''
the low-tech bit is that it 's literally a pig 's heart valve mounted in the high-tech bit , which is a memory metal casing .
and what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery .
and once it 's in the right spot , they remove the outer shell , and the heart valve , well , it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating , instantly .
it 's really a sort of magical moment .
`` so this is actually a dutch company , so i called them up , and i asked , `` can i borrow a heart valve from you ? '' ''
`` so they were like , `` '' okay , we 'll put it in a jar for you with formalin , and you can borrow it . '' '' great — and then i did n't hear from them for weeks , so i called , and i asked , `` '' what 's going on with the heart valve ? '' '' and they said , `` '' well the director of the company decided not to let you borrow this heart valve , because want his product to be associated with pigs . '' '' ( laughter ) well , the last product from the book that i 'm showing you is renewable energy — actually , to show that my first question , if pigs are still used up until the last bit , was still true . ''
in total , i found 185 products .
and what they showed me is that , well , firstly , it 's at least to say odd that we do n't treat these pigs as absolute kings and queens .
and i think that , in order to take better care of what 's behind our products — so , the livestock , the crops , the plants , the non-renewable materials , but also the people that produce these products — the first step would actually be to know that they are there .
thank you very much .
( applause )
and this has certainly been my experience as a traveler .
we have more and more time-saving devices , but sometimes , it seems , less and less time .
the greatest predictor of a movement 's decision to adopt nonviolence is its ideology regarding the role of women in public life .
this village was under a real threat of being wiped off the map when israel started building the separation barrier .
the proposed route would require the destruction of this community 's olive groves , their cemeteries and would ultimately close the village from all sides .
and as you can probably tell at this point , they win at the end .
the separation barrier was changed completely to the internationally recognized green line , and the women of budrus came to be known across the west bank for their indomitable energy .
i 've been talking a lot about my experiences in the middle east , and some of you might be thinking now that the solution then is for us to educate muslim and arab societies to be more inclusive of their women .
if we were to do that , they would be more successful .
they do not need this kind of help .
women have been part of the most influential movements coming out of the middle east , but they tend to be invisible to the international community .
our cameras are largely focused on the men who often end up involved in the more confrontational scenes that we find so irresistible in our news cycle .
and we end up with a narrative that not only erases women from the struggles in the region but often misrepresents the struggles themselves .
it came to be known as the first intifada , and people who have any visual memory of it generally conjure up something like this : palestinian men throwing rocks at israeli tanks .
they did this through networks of popular committees , and their use of direct action and communal self-help projects challenged israel 's very ability to continue ruling the west bank and gaza .
according to the israeli army itself , 97 percent of activities during the first intifada were unarmed .
and here 's another thing that is not part of our narrative about that time .
but women were also a critical driving force , mobilizing , organizing , taking to the streets .
but she played a crucial role in every phase of the struggle , particularly by emphasizing literacy and education .
it 's more profound than that .
without role models , it becomes harder for women to take up their rightful space in public life .
thank you .
( applause )
we live in in a remarkable time , the age of genomics .
your genome is the entire sequence of your dna .
your sequence and mine are slightly different .
and yet , i would like to think that i am more than my genes .
`` all right : `` '' i 'm more than my genes '' '' — all together . ''
( cheering ) sebastian seung : what am i ?
( laughter ) i am my connectome .
everybody : i am my connectome .
ss : that sounded great .
i could just go home now .
its modest nervous system consists of just 300 neurons .
in this diagram , every node is a neuron , and every line is a connection .
this is the connectome of the worm c. elegans .
there 's a diagram like this for your brain , but there 's no way it would fit on this slide .
since the 19th century , neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories — the information that makes you , you — maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain 's neurons .
and perhaps other aspects of your personal identity — maybe your personality and your intellect — maybe they 're also encoded in the connections between your neurons .
i did n't ask you to chant it because it 's true ; i just want you to remember it .
and to find the connectomes of brains more like our own , we need more sophisticated technologies , that are automated , that will speed up the process of finding connectomes .
you can recognize them instantly by their fantastic shapes .
they extend long and delicate branches , and in short , they look like trees .
except , you still may not really recognize them , and that 's because we have to work in three dimensions .
and still , you may not see the branches .
so we start at the top , and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red , and we do that for the next slice and for the next slice .
if we continue through the entire stack , we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron .
and we can do that for another neuron in green .
at the synapse , the two neurons are said to be connected like two friends talking on the telephone .
so you see how to find a synapse .
well , we take this three-dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book .
if we can do that throughout all the images , we could find a connectome .
now , at this point , you 've learned the basics of neurons and synapses .
and so i think we 're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
you already know enough to tell me — what 's wrong with this statement ?
it does n't matter whether you 're a guy or girl , everyone 's brains are like spaghetti .
just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate , one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches .
one neuron can be connected to so many other neurons , because there can be synapses at these points of contact .
and so let 's do a series of comparisons to show you .
i assure you , this is very tiny . it 's just six microns on a side .
and you can tell that , really , only the smallest fragments of branches are contained inside this cube .
and a neuron , well , that 's smaller than brain .
`` neuroscience is hopeless . '' '' because if you look at a brain with your naked eye , you do n't really see how complex it is , but when you use a microscope , finally the hidden complexity is revealed . ''
and , as a scientist , i 'm not supposed to talk about my feelings — too much information , professor .
( laughter ) but may i ? ( laughter )
why did i choose to study this organ that is so awesome in its complexity that it might well be infinite ?
it 's absurd .
how could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this ?
and yet , i persist in this quixotic endeavor .
and indeed , these days i harbor new hopes .
but even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that i am my connectome .
for now , let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis , that it 's actually worth taking seriously .
as you grow during childhood and age during adulthood , your personal identity changes slowly .
likewise , every connectome changes over time .
what kinds of changes happen ?
well , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches , and they can lose old ones .
but that 's not the whole story , because there are signals , electrical signals , that travel along the branches of neurons and chemical signals that jump across from branch to branch .
these signals are called neural activity .
and that 's why every connectome is unique , even those of genetically identical twins .
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome — an idea that you may find empowering .
what 's in this picture ?
a cool and refreshing stream of water , you say .
what else is in this picture ?
and with the stream , i would like to propose a metaphor for the relationship between neural activity and connectivity .
neural activity is constantly changing .
the connections of the brain 's neural network determines the pathways along which neural activity flows .
and if you 'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights , i will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis — or so neuroscientists think — of thoughts , feelings and perceptions .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
neural activity is its water , and the connectome is its bed .
so let 's return from the heights of metaphor and return to science .
well , i propose a direct test .
consider the memory of long temporal sequences of movements , like a pianist playing a beethoven sonata .
and this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements .
they 're going to be scrambled up .
and if we can do that , the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall .
( laughter ) what a mess — have you ever tried to wire up a system as complex as this ?
i hope not .
`` and indeed , the popular press loves headlines like , `` anorexic brains are wired differently , '' or `` '' autistic brains are wired differently . '' '' these are plausible claims , but in truth , we ca n't see the brain 's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true . ''
and so the technologies for seeing connectomes will allow us to finally read mis-wiring of the brain , to see mental disorders in connectomes .
sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication .
one of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics .
we know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing .
the question is : has that damage erased the connectome ?
on the other hand , if the connectome is still intact , we can not ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily .
i 've described a quest that begins in the world of the very small , and propels us to the world of the far future .
as we evolved from our ape-like ancestors on the african savanna , what distinguished us was our larger brains .
eventually , these technologies will become so powerful that we will use them to know ourselves by deconstructing and reconstructing our own brains .
i believe that this voyage of self-discovery is not just for scientists , but for all of us .
and i 'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today .
thank you .
( applause )
all three of the founders of netscape had it .
kids — you can see these signs in kids .
so i just figured that out earlier .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?
and i had these little pillows that i would sew up .
and you could stuff pins in them .
`` that does n't make any sense . '' '' you just figure out a way to make more money faster . ''
every week , i would go to the corner store and buy all these pops .
you ca n't do it on stage .
and they could use those for practice balls .
so i sold lots and lots of sunglasses .
that 's wrong , for me , if you want to raise entrepreneurs .
they walk up with me . every year all the money in the bank goes to their broker .
in two dimensions , if you make , like , a fabric out of them , they 're 30 times stronger than kevlar .
in fact , if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire .
how could you keep the law ?
we ca n't pick the future , but we can steer the future .
the price of retaining the rule of law is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power .
thank you .
the first tunnels date back to 60 b.c .
thank you .
i was 13 months when they removed my left eye .
the problem was getting caught .
fortunately for me , my parents were not poetic .
they were pragmatic .
they believed that i should grow up to enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities as everyone else .
fear immobilizes us in the face of challenge .
they knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge .
i was not raised with fear .
now , moving forward , how do i manage today ?
the world is a much larger nursery .
i do n't care to set a new precedent .
i call this process flash sonar .
now , batman i will accept .
bats are cool . batman is cool .
but i was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable .
i do not use my eyes , i use my brain .
now , someone , somewhere , must think that 's remarkable , or i would n't be up here , but let 's consider this for a moment .
so you ca n't trust those ted folks .
so if you 'd all close your eyes for just a moment , okay ?
shhhhhhhhhh .
shhhhhhhhhhh . ( pitch getting higher and lower ) you do not know the power of the dark side .
okay . now , let 's be sure .
shhhhhhh .
( video ) juan ruiz : it 's like you guys can see with your eyes and we can see with our ears .
brian bushway : it 's not a matter of enjoying it more or less , it 's about enjoying it differently .
shawn marsolais : it goes across . dk : yeah .
sm : and then it 's gradually coming back down again .
if i had the opportunity , honestly , i would n't go back to being sighted .
jr : the bigger the goal , the more obstacles you 'll face , and on the other side of that goal is victory .
i wish you all a most activating journey .
as i know you can see , it 's a spectacular standing ovation at ted .
just one more question about your world , your inner world that you construct .
it works around corners .
it works through surfaces .
generally , it 's kind of a fuzzy three-dimensional geometry .
ca : what do you picture that you 're in right now ?
it 's interesting . when people make a sound , when they laugh , when they fidget , when they take a drink or blow their nose or whatever , i hear everything .
i hear every little movement that every single person makes .
none of it really escapes my attention , and then , from a sonar perspective , the size of the room , the curvature of the audience around the stage , it 's the height of the room .
ca : well , daniel , you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way .
thanks so much for that , truly . dk : thank you .
and then from that point on , you 're basically falling .
this is a climb in the needles , again in california .
rule number eight : strength does n't always equal success .
( applause )
i was n't quite sure how to answer the question .
and it 's not just the view of social scientists .
but race is a bad proxy .
would you imagine with me , just a moment : what would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race ?
so , i wanted to follow that rule .
so , it really was cognitive psychology — you know , cognitive dissonance — that i was experiencing .
so , i was able to stone one adulterer .
the first is , thou shalt not take the bible literally .
this became very , very clear , early on .
so , this idea of sacredness , whether or not there is a god .
thou shall not stereotype .
there 's me reading the bible .
at free america , we 've done a listening and learning tour .
what would it look like if we intervened , with rehabilitation as a core value — with love and compassion as core values ?
james served 12 years in the san quentin state prison and is being released in 18 months .
i 'd like to introduce you to james right now , and he 's going to share his journey of redemption through spoken word .
the talent is abundant behind prison walls .
future software engineers , entrepreneurs , craftsmen , musicians and artists .
`` this piece is entitled , `` '' where i live . '' '' i live in a world where most people are too afraid to go . ''
better yet , imagine a world where healed people helped hurt people heal and become strong .
`` maybe then we would all be singin ' `` '' redemption song . '' '' i live in a world that has been called `` '' hell on earth '' '' by those trapped inside . ''
many of us , for years , have been battling our inner demons .
we walk around smiling when inside we 're really screamin ' : freedom !
the key : forgiveness .
because freedom ...
it is n't a place .
thank you .
we forward in this generation triumphantly .
emancipate yourselves from mental slavery .
none but ourselves can free our minds .
have no fear for atomic energy 'cause none of them can stop the time .
some say it 's just a part of it , we 've got to fulfill the book .
these songs of freedom .
i was in my 20s before i ever went to an art museum .
and my childhood is more hick than i could ever possibly relate to you , and also more intellectual than you would ever expect .
he can read a novel or two a day .
and what was so amazing to me about that — well he would be in his recliner , would holler for me to fetch the bb gun , and i 'd go get it .
and what was amazing to me — well it was pretty kickass ; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun — but what was so amazing to me was that he knew just enough how to pump it .
a few years ago , i spent months in europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world .
and i was longing for several things that i was n't getting , or not getting enough of .
but two of the main things : one of it , i was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public , that was accessible .
and the second thing that i was longing for was some more exquisite craftsmanship and technique .
i 'm going to organize it and direct it and get it going in the world .
so i thought , okay , i have to have some criteria of how to choose work .
so amongst all the criteria i have , there 's two main things .
one of them , i call my mimaw 's test .
it needs to worked on until it can speak fluently .
`` and then my other second set of rules — i hate to say `` '' rules '' '' because it 's art — my criteria would be the three h 's , which is head , heart and hands . ''
`` and great art would have `` '' head '' '' : it would have interesting intellectual ideas and concepts . ''
`` and it would have `` '' hand '' '' in that it would be greatly crafted . ''
( laughter ) and so this is what i did .
so i thought , a biennial needs artists .
so what i did was i invented a hundred artists from around the world .
i figured out their bios , their passions in life and their art styles , and i started making their work .
( laughter ) ( applause ) i felt , oh this is the kind of project that i could spend my whole life doing .
so i decided , i 'm going to make this a real biennial .
it 's going to be two years of studio work .
and i 'm going to create this in two years , and i have .
so i should start to talk about these guys .
and i 'm such a technician , so i loved this project , getting to play with all the techniques .
and then at the other end , there 's performance and short films and indoor installations like this indoor installation and this one , and outdoor installations like this one and this one .
i know i should mention : i 'm making all these things .
i 'm under the river with those fish .
nell is interested in agricultural processes , and her work is based in these practices .
and this is 22 feet long .
and what i loved about her work is , when i would walk around it and look down into the sky , looking down to watch the sky , and it unfolded in a new way .
so this piece was great fun because it was two days of digging in soft dirt .
the next artist is kay overstry , and she 's interested in ephemerality and transience .
the sun rises , and it melts away .
one of these is scratch-off masterpieces .
and you buy one , and maybe you get a real piece , and maybe not .
and all these works , in some way , talk about luck or fate or chance .
`` this artist is gus weinmueller , and he 's doing a project , a large project , called `` '' art for the peoples . '' '' and within this project , he 's doing a smaller project called `` '' artists in residence . '' '' and what he does is — ( laughter ) he spends a week at a time with a family . ''
and he shows up on their porch , their doorstep , with a toothbrush and pajamas , and he 's ready to spend the week with them .
he has all these discussions with their family , and he digs through everything they have , and he finds materials to make work .
and he makes a work that answers what they think great art is .
this next project , this is by jaochim parisvega , and he 's interested in — he believes art is everywhere waiting — that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen .
and he provides this push by harnessing natural forces , like in his series where he used rain to make paintings .
she 's a very serious swiss artist .
( laughter ) and she was thinking about her friends and family who work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries , and she was thinking , what can i make that would be of value to them , in case something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman ?
and so she came up with creating these pocket-sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them .
and you would carry this around with you , and if everything went to hell , you could make payments and buy your life .
so hopefully what happens is you never use it , and it 's an heirloom that you pass down .
and she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments , or they could be like these , which are leaves that can be payments .
and so they 're valuable . this is precious metals and gemstones .
he had to break off a piece to get out of egypt recently .
this is by a duo , michael abernathy and bud holland .
( laughter ) and we got a lot of attention when we did it .
`` and i was like , `` '' get dressed for a funeral . we 're going to go do some work . '' '' and so we got to the grave and made this , which was hilarious — the attention that we got . ''
so what happens is you dance on the grave , and after you 've done your dance , everyone toasts you and tells you how great you are .
and you in essence have a funeral that you get to be present for .
that 's my mom and dad .
this is by jason birdsong .
he is interested in how we see as an animal , how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage .
you know , we look down a dark alley or a jungle path , trying to make out a face or a creature .
they 're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage .
so he pairs these up .
and he pairs these up with paintings .
like this is a painting of a snake in a box .
`` so you open the box and you think , `` '' whoa , there 's a snake in there . '' '' but it 's actually a painting . ''
so he makes these interesting conversations about realism and mimicry and our drive to be fooled by great camouflage .
( laughter ) the next artist is hazel clausen .
`` hazel clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided , `` '' you know , i would learn a lot about culture if i created a culture that does n't exist from scratch . '' '' so that 's what she did . ''
and also they reference how the uvula — everything they say is fallen because of the forbidden fruit .
`` and this is from a documentary called `` '' sexual practices and populations control among the uvulites . '' '' this is a typical angora embroidery for them . ''
this is one of their founders , gert schaeffer .
( laughter ) and actually this is my aunt irene .
and i crack up at this piece , because when i see it i know that 's french angora and all antique german ribbons and wool that i got in a nebraska mill and carried around for 10 years and then antique chinese skirts .
the next is a collective of artists called the silver dobermans , and their motto is to spread pragmatism one person at a time .
( laughter ) and they 're really interested in how over-coddled we 've become .
so this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we 've become .
and what they 've done is they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence .
`` ( laughter ) ( applause ) and this is called `` '' horse sense fence . '' '' the next artist is k. m. yoon , a really interesting south korean artist . ''
next is maynard sipes .
next is roy penig , a really interesting kentucky artist , and he 's the nicest guy .
`` next is an australian artist , janeen jackson , and this is from a project of hers called `` '' what an artwork does when we 're not watching . '' '' ( laughter ) next is by a lithuanian fortune teller , jurgi petrauskas . ''
next is ginger cheshire .
the next , this is by sam sandy .
he 's an australian aboriginal elder , and he 's also an artist .
she heals with color .
and she 's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists , even though she 's going to be 90 next year .
and i have to say , vera kind of scares me .
you ca n't look her directly in the eyes because she 's kind of scary .
and it 's good that she 's not real ; she 'd be mad that i said that .
( laughter ) and she 's an optometrist in st. petersburg , and she plays with optics .
`` this is from a short film , `` '' adventures with skinny . '' '' ( laughter ) and this is by cicily bennett , and it 's from a series of short films . ''
and after this one , there 's 77 other artists .
thank you . thank you .
( applause ) thank you . thanks . ( applause )
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and i was living on the dark side .
now , maui was terrified of the dark , so i had to carry him up the stairs , actually down the stairs first , for his walk , and then bring him back up .
i was also hauling gallons of bottles of water up to the seventh floor every day .
the stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread .
i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points .
i was n't the only one .
even in the rain , people stood between madison and 5th avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street .
i think there 's nothing like a crisis to tell you what 's really important and what 's not , and sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter .
the self as we once knew it no longer exists , and i think that an abstract , digital universe has become a part of our identity , and i want to talk to you about what i think that means .
they 're both stories , interpretations .
you and i can experience things without a story .
we might run up the stairs too quickly and we might get breathless .
our story of our life is based on direct experience , but it 's embellished .
it needs months and years .
it 's not only about the heartbreak and the happiness , the victories and the disappointments , but it 's because how because of these , and sometimes , more importantly , in spite of these , we find our place in the world and we change it and we change ourselves .
without it , we would have no music .
it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world , and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
science can do things with and in a picosecond , but you and i are never going to have the inner experience of a millionth of a millionth of a second .
you and i answer only to nature 's rhythm and flow , to the sun , the moon and the seasons , and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past , the present and the future to see things for what they are , to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations .
so many of us today have the sensation that time 's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once .
this is because time does n't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one .
far away over there is now here .
and that 's not all .
your last job , your dinner reservations from last year , your former friends , lie on a flat plain with today 's friends , because the internet also archives , and it warps the past .
with no distinction left between the past , the present and the future , and the here or there , we are left with this moment everywhere , this moment that i 'll call the digital now .
just how can we prioritize in the landscape of the digital now ?
this is n't the now of a shooting pain in your foot or the second that you bite into a pastry or the three hours that you lose yourself in a great book .
this now bears very little physical or psychological reference to our own state .
every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else .
choice is freedom , but not when it 's constantly for its own sake .
not just is the digital now far from the present , but it 's in direct competition with it , and this is because not just am i absent from it , but so are you .
not just are we absent from it , but so is everyone else .
at all times , i can operate at a different rhythm and pace from you , while i sustain the illusion that i 'm tapped into you in real time .
for example , it 's said that there are more people in india with access to cell phones than toilets .
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it , the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous .
possibly , but i remember my childhood .
and even here , when i look at the great bear , i get back that feeling of being a child , hanging onto his head and trying to balance myself on his shoulder , and i can get back that feeling of being a child again .
time-warping technology challenges our deepest core , because we are able to archive the past and some of it becomes hard to forget , even as the current moment is increasingly unmemorable .
we want to clutch , and we are left instead clutching at a series of static moments .
they 're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them .
by archiving everything , we think that we can store it , but time is not data .
it can not be stored .
you and i know exactly what it means like to be truly present in a moment .
at such moments , our selves are complete .
the present encapsulates the past and a promise for the future .
the present joins a flow of time from before and after .
i first experienced these feelings with my grandmother .
attention is time .
one of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention , and definitely from my grandmother , love and attention were one and the same thing .
but we do n't need to let it .
we 've seen again and again just how creative technology can be , and in our lives and in our actions , we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it .
we can slow down and we can tune in to the ebb and flow of time .
we can choose to take time back .
thank you .
because we are all patients , we are all people .
even doctors are patients at some point .
so i want to talk about that as an opportunity that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country and , in fact , worldwide .
if you want to get at the big part — i mean from a public health level , where my training is — you 're looking at behavioral issues .
you 're looking at things where people are actually given information , and they 're not following through with it .
it 's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes , obesity , many forms of heart disease , even some forms of cancer — when you think of smoking .
those are all behaviors where people know what they 're supposed to do .
they know what they 're supposed to be doing , but they 're not doing it .
i mean , they complain about it all the time .
but for as much as clinical medicine agonizes over behavior change , there 's not a lot of work done in terms of trying to fix that problem .
so the crux of it comes down to this notion of decision-making — giving information to people in a form that does n't just educate them or inform them , but actually leads them to make better decisions , better choices in their lives .
one part of medicine , though , has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well , and that 's dentistry .
people brush and floss their teeth .
so i 'm going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago .
they wanted to tell them how bad it would be if they did n't brush and floss their teeth .
they had a big patient population .
they divided them up into two groups .
so that was the low-fear group .
they showed puss oozing out from between their teeth .
you 'll eat mush for the rest of your life .
that was the message . that was the experiment .
`` so they asked them at the beginning , `` do you think you 'll actually be able to stick with this program ? '' ''
`` and the people who said , `` '' yeah , yeah . i 'm pretty good about that , '' '' they were characterized as high efficacy , and the people who said , `` eh , i never get around to brushing and flossing as much as i should , '' they were characterized as low efficacy . ''
so the upshot was this .
so fear showed up as not really the driver .
so i want to isolate this , because it was a great observation — 30 years ago , right , 30 years ago — and it 's one that 's laid fallow in research .
it was a notion that really came out of albert bandura 's work , who studied whether people could get a sense of empowerment .
we do n't really know how to manipulate it , though , that well .
so fear does n't work , right ? fear does n't work .
and this is a great example of how we have n't learned that lesson at all .
this is still the way we 're communicating messages about health .
now here 's what does work : personalized information works .
again , bandura recognized this years ago , decades ago .
so let me just spool it out a little bit .
and that does n't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers — this overload of health information that we 're inundated with .
that information then needs to be connected to choices , needs to be connected to a range of options , directions that we might go to — trade-offs , benefits .
finally , we need to be presented with a clear point of action .
we need to connect the information always with the action , and then that action feeds back into different information , and it creates , of course , a feedback loop .
but the problem is that things — in the upper-right corner there — personalized data , it 's been pretty hard to come by .
it 's a difficult and expensive commodity , until now .
you 've seen them all around , especially these days as radars are cheaper .
the choice in this case is pretty simple .
we either keep going fast , or we slow down .
we should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now .
we should take our foot off the pedal right now , and generally we do . these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down .
but it works , and it even has some health repercussions .
your blood pressure might drop a little bit .
because in health care , most health care , the data is very removed from the action .
it 's very difficult to line things up so neatly .
but we have an opportunity .
so i want to talk about , i want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country , how we actually get information .
this is a pharmaceutical ad .
nobody 's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug havidol quite yet .
so it 's exactly the way we get health information and pharmaceutical information , and it just sounds perfect .
because we know .
and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it ?
there is no good faith in this .
so this is a different approach .
they went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal , works for our food , actually helps people understand what 's in their food .
god forbid we should use that same standard that we make cap'n crunch live by and bring it to drug companies .
you can understand exactly what the benefits are .
and finally , you understand what those choices are .
every time you take a drug , you 're walking into a possible side effect .
so it spells those out in very clean terms , and that works .
and so i was thinking about , what 's an opportunity that i could have to help people understand information ?
and so i came up with this : lab test results .
blood test results are this great source of information .
they 're packed with information .
they 're just not for us . they 're not for people . they 're not for patients .
they go right to doctors .
this is the worst presented information .
what we did at wired was we went , and i got our graphic design department to re-imagine these lab reports .
so that 's what i want to walk you through .
the after takes what was four pages — that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that 's just the general blood work .
it goes on and on and on , all these values , all these numbers you do n't know .
we use the notion of color .
it 's an amazing notion that color could be used .
likewise , you can go over your lipids and , again , understand what your overall cholesterol level is and then break down into the hdl and the ldl if you so choose .
we tell you that you 're okay , you 're normal .
and then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop : we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate .
we give them some insight into what choices they can make , what actions they can take .
then we went to crp test .
they have this huge amount of space , and they do n't use it for anything , so we do .
now the crp test is often done following a cholesterol test , or in conjunction with a cholesterol test .
so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well .
what you 're actually measuring is spelled out in clean language .
so we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that 's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is .
we again personalized the risks .
so this patient is in their 50s , so we can actually give them a very precise estimate of what their risk for prostate cancer is .
in this case it 's about 25 percent , based on that .
and then again , the follow-up actions .
that 's what wired magazine spent on this .
it should be the patient .
it 's the person who actually , in the end , is going to be having to change their lives and then start adopting new behaviors .
this is information that is incredibly powerful .
but we 're not using it . it 's just sitting there .
it 's being lost .
so i want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask , because i do n't actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports .
anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions : can i have my results ?
and the only acceptable answer is — ( audience : yes . ) — yes .
what does this mean ? help me understand what the data is .
you do not need to have the education level of people in this room .
i 've been talking today about latent information , all this information that exists in the system that we 're not putting to use .
( applause )
for the next 16 minutes , i 'm going to take you on a journey that is probably the biggest dream of humanity : to understand the code of life .
and i was not existent before .
what amount of information does it take to build and assemble a human ?
so , imagine that the building blocks are little atoms and there is a hydrogen here , a carbon here , a nitrogen here .
every time you see from now on a pregnant lady , she 's assembling the biggest amount of information that you will ever encounter .
and to build a human , you need three billion of them .
thousands and thousands and thousands and millions of letters .
and they apparently make sense .
for the rest , we are all absolutely identical .
five hundred pages is the miracle of life that you are .
we 're going to use a technology called machine learning .
on the other side , we collected the biggest database of human beings : phenotypes , 3d scan , nmr — everything you can think of .
we build a machine and we train a machine — well , not exactly one machine , many , many machines — to try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype .
what are those letters , and what do they do ?
can we read the books and predict your height ?
can we predict eye color ?
we can , because apparently , the code changes during your life .
now , after 15 years — 15 years after we read the first sequence — this october , we started to see some signals .
this is a face for us .
we predict his eye color .
we are almost there .
and this is not the topic of my talk , because we will learn more .
there are the best minds in the world on this topic .
the prediction will get better , the model will get more precise .
and it 's a revolution that can not be confined in the domain of science or technology .
this must be a global conversation .
thank you .
well to start to do this , we took a 3d printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware .
and so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time , we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry .
now what could this mean ?
so how are we doing this in the lab ?
and this is what we 're doing in the lab at the moment .
but to take baby steps to get there , first of all we want to look at drug design and production , or drug discovery and manufacturing .
say a new super bug has emerged .
so this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly .
well , you 're going to have your own personal matter fabricator .
beam me up , scotty .
they do find what jobs they can get to pay off a debt that is secured on their person .
but it is nearly impossible for an american to get discharged their student loan debts .
once upon a time in america , going to college did not mean graduating with debt .
my friend paul 's father graduated from colorado state university on the gi bill .
not anymore .
when paul also graduated from colorado state university , he paid for his english degree by working part-time .
30 years ago , higher education tuition was affordable , reasonable , and what debts you accumulated , you paid off by graduation date .
but so what ?
getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off with the increased income that you earned from it .
but that 's where the rubber meets the road .
even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013 .
1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas make it abundantly obvious that higher education is a consumer product you can buy .
all of us talk about education just as the economists do now , as an investment that you make to improve the human stock by training them for work .
the u.s. news & world report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines .
and just like home mortgages , student loans can be bundled and packaged and sliced and diced , and sold on wall street .
and colleges and universities that invest in these securitized loans profit twice .
with all that money to be made , are we surprised that some in the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertising , in bait and switch ...
in exploiting the very ignorance that they pretend to educate ?
third : diplomas are a brand .
`` many years ago my teacher wrote , `` '' when students are treated as consumers , they 're made prisoners of addiction and envy . '' '' just as consumers can be sold and resold upgraded versions of an iphone , so also people can be sold more and more education . ''
higher education is also marketed as a status object .
of the 55 that do graduate , two will remain unemployed , and another 18 are underemployed .
now even economists admit going to college pays off for only those who complete it .
college premium ?
and the future , for them , does n't look particularly promising — in fact , it 's downright bleak .
there is such a thing , by the way .
what if there was an app for that ?
let 's call it income-based tuition or ibt .
one of you make this .
there 's a second benefit to income-based tuition .
my students and i work on very tiny robots .
insects move around amazingly well .
jumping is another really interesting way to get around when you 're very small .
so these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly to get the high power they need to jump out of water , for example .
so this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side , so really tiny .
so this is aaron , the graduate student in question , with the tweezers , and what you see is this four-millimeter-sized mechanism jumping almost 40 centimeters high .
that 's almost 100 times its own length .
and it survives , bounces on the table , it 's incredibly robust , and of course survives quite well until we lose it because it 's very tiny .
so this leads to the robot that i showed you earlier .
we all move in this kind of bouncy way when we run .
and you 'll see a big flash at the beginning when the energetic is set off , and the robot tumbling through the air .
so there 's no tethers on this , no wires connecting to this .
imagine the rubble that you get after a natural disaster like an earthquake .
or they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place .
and we 've made some advances so far , but there 's still a long way to go , and hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination .
thanks very much .
what if we did n't ?
let 's fast-forward just 15 years from now .
and because you and your partner consciously made that decision , many in your social circle , they kind of look down on you .
yeah . upgrades .
and now , jenna is an actual , real person .
she 's beautiful , tall , athletic , and the list goes on and on .
would n't that be illegal ?
so i 've been talking about this crispr technology .
it 's really that simple .
this is so ubiquitous now .
that 's not what 's going to be driving them .
and they 're going to go for designer babies .
so why should we be concerned about this ?
and when my grandparents had little baby peter , the world was very different . right ?
if we could do those things , we could make those things happen , or we could make them happen in our children , it would be very seductive .
and yet coming with it would be these risks .
that easily could happen .
i do n't think so . i do n't think it 's going to get to that extreme .
so i 'll just give you one example , and that is in vitro fertilization .
we 're at a park , and our kid is swinging on the swing .
what they care about is the robot .
and i said — very last minute — you know , you really should share that story .
ss : oh , yeah . pm : what was that story ?
and i did . and i think that 's a really important part of the journey .
ss : i mean , i 'm grateful , i 'm honored , i 'm happy , and it 's the very beginning .
so i do n't know if i 'm an expert , or if anyone is an expert . i certainly have done a lot of research .
all over the world , no matter what our cultures are , we think men should be strong , assertive , aggressive , have voice ; we think women should speak when spoken to , help others .
if you 're a woman , please raise your hand if you 've ever been told you 're too aggressive at work .
there is a circle that 's been started for rescued sex workers in miami .
ss : a lot more leaning in .
can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is ?
`` this is the point when people started asking me , `` andrew , can you make body parts out of apples ? '' ''
`` and i 'm like , `` '' you 've come to the right place . '' '' ( laughter ) i actually brought this up with my wife . ''
( laughter ) it 's a good lab , man . ( laughter )
and then we grew cells on them .
and this is the result .
listen , my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business .
people have actually been working on this for decades .
so what we did was put all the instructions online as open source .
speaking of kitchens , here 's some asparagus .
this image reminds me of two things : our blood vessels and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord .
so here 's the question : can we grow axons and neurons down these channels ?
but we are the only ones using asparagus .
it 's how i train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative and to decide to make human apple ears .
thank you .
i check and — ( applause ) i check that email account religiously all the time .
so , the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking .
it 's 3.2 tons .
this is a part of the nose of the animaris percipiere .
so we have a problem .
every generation is twice as well-off as its parents ' .
think of all the problems that we 're facing at the moment .
chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis .
they make human efforts derail .
there are two ways to look at it , to prove it .
this is what we will do today .
we are going to look at the race .
clarity .
we need more clarity , we need to clarify the roles , the processes .
who is accountable for this process ?
measurement .
what gets measured gets done .
it will come at the expense of your measurable speed .
in the legs of the next runner .
and the baton will fall and slow down .
and people are not stupid ; they do n't cooperate .
do n't look for clarity ; go for fuzziness .
thank you .
many times i go around the world to speak , and people ask me questions about the challenges , my moments , some of my regrets .
1998 : a single mother of four , three months after the birth of my fourth child , i went to do a job as a research assistant .
i went to northern liberia .
and as part of the work , the village would give you lodgings .
`` the mother came to me , knelt down , and said , `` '' leymah , take my daughter . ''
`` with tears in my eyes , i said , `` '' no . '' '' two months later , i go to another village on the same assignment and they asked me to live with the village chief . ''
the women 's chief of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dirty .
and all day she walked around only in her underwear .
i bought her used clothes and bought her her first doll .
i wish to go with you .
`` i wish to go to school . '' '' dirt poor , no money , living with my parents , i again said , `` '' no . '' '' two months later , both of those villages fell into another war . ''
till today , i have no idea where those two girls are .
`` fast-forward , 2004 : in the peak of our activism , the minister of gender liberia called me and said , `` '' leymah , i have a nine-year-old for you . ''
she came to me bloated , very pale .
`` she 'd lie beside me and say , `` '' auntie , i wish to be well . ''
`` i wish to go to school . '' '' 2010 : a young woman stands before president sirleaf and gives her testimony of how she and her siblings live together , their father and mother died during the war . ''
she 's highly athletic .
the director of sports who 's responsible for getting her into the program asks her to come out of class .
great people have made commitments — we will protect our children from want and from fear .
the u.n. has the convention on the rights of the child .
countries like america , we 've heard things like no child left behind .
there is a millennium development called three that focuses on girls .
all of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally , i think , has failed .
in liberia , for example , the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls .
teen prostitution is at its peak .
several years ago , a few friends of mine decided we needed to bridge the disconnect between our generation and the generation of young women .
we created a space called the young girls transformative project .
we go into rural communities and all we do , like has been done in this room , is create the space .
one young woman i met , teen mother of four , never thought about finishing high school , graduated successfully ; never thought about going to college , enrolled in college .
and you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education .
juanita is her name .
and if i ca n't be educated , when i see some of my sisters being educated , my wish has been fulfilled .
i wish for a better life .
several years ago , there was one african girl .
i will fulfill the wish .
this is another african girl 's wish .
i failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls .
these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman — i failed , i failed , i failed .
not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true , the wish of peace came true .
this young woman wished also to go to school .
she went to school .
this young woman wished for other things to happen , it happened for her .
i 'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish , in my tiny capacity , of little african girls — the wish of being educated .
we set up a foundation .
we 're giving full four-year scholarships to girls from villages that we see with potential .
i do n't have much to ask of you .
i 've also been to places in this u.s. , and i know that girls in this country also have wishes , a wish for a better life somewhere in the bronx , a wish for a better life somewhere in downtown l.a. , a wish for a better life somewhere in texas , a wish for a better life somewhere in new york , a wish for a better life somewhere in new jersey .
will you journey with me to help that girl , be it an african girl or an american girl or a japanese girl , fulfill her wish , fulfill her dream , achieve that dream ?
because all of these great innovators and inventors that we 've talked to and seen over the last few days are also sitting in tiny corners in different parts of the world , and all they 're asking us to do is create that space to unlock the intelligence , unlock the passion , unlock all of the great things that they hold within themselves .
thank you .
( applause ) chris anderson : thank you so much .
right now in liberia , what do you see as the main issue that troubles you ?
lg : i 've been asked to lead the liberian reconciliation initiative .
but sadly , the vision of a great future , or the dream of a great future , is just a dream , because you have all of these vices .
teen pregnancy , like i said , is epidemic .
`` and maybe , just maybe , saying , `` '' because of that nobel laureate i 'm here today . '' '' so i 'm troubled when i see them like there 's no hope . ''
but i 'm also not pessimistic , because i know it does n't take a lot to get them charged up .
ca : and in the last year , tell us one hopeful thing that you 've seen happening .
lg : i can tell you many hopeful things that i 've seen happening .
but in the last year , where president sirleaf comes from , her village , we went there to work with these girls .
this is one place where women were never — even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men .
`` but not only did they do that , they went to those who were running for seats to ask them , `` '' what is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win ? '' '' and one of the guys who already had a seat was very — because liberia has one of the strongest rape laws , and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric . ''
and when the girls started engaging him , he was very hostile towards them .
he 's out of office today .
it 's wonderful to be here to talk about my journey , to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me .
when i started using the wheelchair , it was a tremendous new freedom .
it was like having an enormous new toy .
just being out on the street was exhilarating .
but even though i had this newfound joy and freedom , people 's reaction completely changed towards me .
they seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair .
`` when i asked people their associations with the wheelchair , they used words like `` '' limitation , '' '' `` '' fear , '' '' `` pity '' and `` restriction . '' ''
i realized i 'd internalized these responses and it had changed who i was on a core level .
i was seeing myself not from my perspective , but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people 's responses to me .
the wheelchair became an object to paint and play with .
when i literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom , it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people .
it seemed to open up new perspectives , and therein lay the paradigm shift .
for me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation .
`` in fact , i now call the underwater wheelchair `` '' portal , '' '' because it 's literally pushed me through into a new way of being , into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness . ''
we did that .
some developed alcoholism . a few developed schizophrenia .
we 've learned three big lessons about relationships .
well , we 're human .
now imagine what you could place in your hands : an apple , maybe your wallet .
your life as you know it goes into suspended animation .
she was walking to work one day in april , 1992 , in a miniskirt and high heels . she worked in a bank .
and suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of sarajevo knocking everything out of its path .
she thinks she 's dreaming , but she 's not .
and she did n't see him for years .
i learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
most of all , i learned about love .
even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who 's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life , helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals .
i learned so much about myself .
`` martha gellhorn , who 's one of my heroes , once said , `` you can only love one war . the rest is responsibility . '' ''
last april , i went back to a very strange — what i called a deranged high school reunion .
`` what it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of sarajevo , and i do n't like the word `` '' anniversary , '' '' because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party . ''
i now cover syria , and i started reporting it because i believed that it needs to be done .
i see , again , a template of the war in bosnia .
people do n't want to believe it 's coming , so they do n't leave , they do n't leave before they can .
they do n't get their money out .
rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot .
and that was just a small percentage of the dead .
and there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes .
fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women , which is fantastic , and there 's also within the national constitution now , you 're actually not allowed to say hutu or tutsi .
and an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story , or i find it beautiful .
there was a group of children , mixed hutus and tutsis , and a group of women who were adopting them , and they lined up and one was just given to the next .
there was no kind of compensation for , you 're a tutsi , you 're a hutu , you might have killed my mother , you might have killed my father .
when i go back to syria , next week in fact , what i see is incredibly heroic people , some of them fighting for democracy , for things we take for granted every single day .
`` and i called him luca , which means `` '' the bringer of light , '' '' because he does bring light to my life . ''
`` why are n't you home with luca ? '' '' and i said , `` '' well , i have to see . '' '' it was 2004 which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in iraq , `` '' i have to see , i have to see what is happening here . ''
`` but there will always be another war . '' '' and there , sadly , will always be wars . ''
i 'm not a u.n. conflict resolution person .
all i am is a witness .
my role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless .
a colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world .
and that 's what i try to do .
i 'm not always successful , and sometimes it 's incredibly frustrating , because you feel like you 're writing into a void , or you feel like no one cares .
who cares about the congo , the ivory coast , liberia , sierra leone , all of these strings of places that i will remember for the rest of my life ?
but my métier is to bear witness and that is the crux , the heart of the matter , for us reporters who do this .
( applause )
it changed our view of the physical world .
it was a great place to grow up , but it 's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world .
in 2005 , the world watched as new orleans and the gulf coast were devastated by hurricane katrina .
one thousand , eight hundred and thirty-six people died . nearly 300,000 homes were lost .
in 2008 , cyclone nargis and its aftermath killed 138,000 in myanmar .
and how will they cope in a foreign land ?
will there be tensions over immigration , or conflicts over competition for limited resources ?
like it or not , ready or not , this is our future .
sure , some are looking for opportunities in this new world .
that 's the russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding arctic sea ice .
the military gets it . they call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security , while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond .
so what can we do ? how can we prepare and adapt ?
i 'd like to share three sets of examples , starting with adapting to violent storms and floods .
in new orleans , the i-10 twin spans , with sections knocked out in katrina , have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge .
and these raised and energy-efficient homes were developed by brad pitt and make it right for the hard-hit ninth ward .
the devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher , it 's poised to become the first energy star church in the country .
their march electricity bill was only 48 dollars .
for example , in galveston , here 's a resilient home that survived hurricane ike , when others on neighboring lots clearly did not .
but as important as technology and infrastructure are , perhaps the human element is even more critical .
we need better planning and systems for evacuation .
we need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis , and why .
second , preparing for heat and drought .
oxfam and swiss re , together with rockefeller foundation , are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water , but they 're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come .
it 's allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time , without assistance .
washington , d.c. , last year , actually led the nation in new green roofs installed , and they 're funding this in part thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags .
so some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins .
third , adapting to rising seas .
sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems , agriculture , even major cities . this is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the mekong delta .
that 's where half of vietnam 's rice is grown .
infrastructure is going to be affected .
san francisco is also spending 40 million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment , as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater , causing backups at the plant , harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste .
beyond these technical solutions , our work at the georgetown climate center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change .
other examples to consider . in the u.k. , the thames barrier protects london from storm surge .
these are not only important ecosystems in their own right , but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities .
new york city is incredibly vulnerable to storms , as you can see from this clever sign , and to sea level rise , and to storm surge , as you can see from the subway flooding .
adaptation 's too important to be left to the experts .
we 're entering uncharted territory , and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past .
we 're operating outside the bounds of co2 concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years .
there are no one-size-fits-all solutions .
we 're all learning by doing .
again , we start by designing the human into the process .
the foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization .
these were networks of mercenaries , not ideologues , who were in the coordination business for profit .
it was outlawed in chicago for a while .
it 's pending here in california , and just recently in new york .
it 's like if you 're a chef and you put it on your menu , you risk being attacked .
its liver expands by eight times .
suffice to say it 's like — it 's not the prettiest picture of sustainable farming .
( laughter ) i mean , i love the stuff .
can we produce a menu that 's delicious without foie gras ?
yes , sure .
you can also bike the tour de france without steroids , right ?
and for good reason .
( laughter ) so several months ago , a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
natural foie gras .
as he said to me , that really pissed the french off .
it was all over the papers .
`` `` '' spanish chef accused ... `` '' — and the french accused him . ''
they accused him of paying off the judges .
they implicated actually , the spanish government , amazingly .
so by definition , he 's lying and should be disqualified .
he repeated that about 50 times in the two days i was with him .
and i thought , ok , excited jew from new york , right ?
but he was still going like this .
i figured it out .
i was speaking too loudly .
so i hushed my voice .
i kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator in kind of a half whisper .
you fence in animals . you electrify the inside .
now , what happened ?
there 's figs and everything else there for the taking .
extra difficult . extra hard .
and they are allowed to take whatever they want .
`` he lets them take what they want and he says , `` usually , it 's about 50 percent . they 're very fair . '' ''
the other 50 percent , he takes and he sells and he makes money on them .
part of the income for his farm .
it 's the indication that it 's the best foie gras .
but he found this wild plant called the lupin bush .
and the geese love the lupin bush .
not for the bush , but for the seeds .
is he like , you know — because he seemed to have an answer for everything , and it was always nature .
it was never him .
and we 're sitting there , and i hear [ clapping ] from a distance , so i look over .
and like airport traffic control , as they start to go past us they 're called back — and they 're called back and back and back .
think about that for a minute .
but it truly was the best foie gras of my life .
i 'd had something that was called foie gras .
it had all the qualities of foie gras , but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty .
but i can taste things .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what ?
and as he said , i think fittingly , it 's a gift from god , with god saying , you 've done good work .
what the hell does that mean ?
and they slaughtered them , used the fat throughout the winter for cooking .
it 's the history of what we eat today .
and for the future it wo n't serve us .
jonas salk has a great quote .
( mosquito buzzing ) ( swat ) gotcha .
mosquitos . i hate them .
knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood ? that 's awful , right ?
in fact , there 's only one good thing i can think of when it gets to mosquitos .
when they fly into our bedroom at night , they prefer to bite my wife .
why does she receive more bites than i do ?
and the answer is smell , the smell of her body .
and since we all smell different and produce chemicals on our skin that either attract or repel mosquitos , some of us are just more attractive than others .
so my wife smells nicer than i do , or i just stink more than she does .
and during my ph.d , i wanted to know exactly what chemicals from our skin mosquitos used , african malarial mosquitos use to track us down at night .
and therefore , we set up various experiments .
but perhaps if we can attract these mosquitos to traps , bait it with our smell , we may be able to stop transmission of disease .
first , we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body . strange .
so we set up an experiment whereby we put a naked volunteer in a large cage , and in that cage we released mosquitos to see where they were biting on the body of that person .
they had a very strong preference for biting on the face .
in contrast , the african malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person , and that of course we should have known all along because they 're called mosqui-toes , you see ? ( laughter ) that 's right . ( applause ) and so we started focusing on the smell of feet , on the smell of human feet , until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse . think of it .
( applause ) that 's the cheese , just to show you .
my second story is remarkable as well .
and i will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria .
one of the best ways of killing mosquitos is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease .
they 're all together there . they are immobile .
so the problem that we face with this is that , throughout the landscape , all these pools of water with the larvae , they are scattered all over the place , which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides .
and so we set up another crazy experiment , because we collected the smell of these larvae , put it on pieces of cloth , and then did something very remarkable .
here we have a bar with four holes , and we put the smell of these larvae in the left hole .
and then you see the dog . it 's called tweed . it 's a border collie .
he 's going back to check the control holes again , but he 's coming back to the first one , and now he 's locking into that smell , which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field , and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria .
since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites smell different compared to people that are uninfected , she 's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite .
that means that in a population where malaria has gone down all the way , and there 's few people remaining with parasites , that the dogs can find these people , we can treat them with anti-malarial drugs , and give the final blow to malaria .
in fact , people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos .
it 's a tablet , a simple tablet , and when i take it with water , it does miracles .
what i 'm going to show you is i 'm gon na stick my arm into it and i will show you how quickly they will bite .
here we go .
there we go . okay .
have a look . that does n't work . okay . sorry about that .
now think of what we can do with this .
that would give us an opportunity to actually eliminate malaria as a disease .
that 's the kind of out-of-the-box science that i love doing , for the betterment of mankind , but especially for her , so that she can grow up in a world without malaria . thank you . ( applause )
you can see hillary clinton on the right .
as reporters , we research , we interview .
we also have our own unconscious biases .
putting them there made them more recognizable .
the daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting .
that hit me so hard , telling these people that had been through this experience .
and so we did just that .
you guys want to see some ?
so i need a volunteer .
okay , so sam , i want you to squeeze your hand again .
i grew up in a very small village in canada , and i 'm an undiagnosed dyslexic .
i ran away .
i left when i was 25 years old to go to bali , and there i met my incredible wife , cynthia , and together , over 20 years , we built an amazing jewelry business .
then she took me to see a film that i really did n't want to see .
`` it ruined my life — ( laughter ) `` '' the inconvenient truth '' '' and mr . gore . ''
i have four kids , and even if part of what he says is true , they 're not going to have the life that i had .
so here 's the world , and here we are in bali .
it 's a tiny , little island — 60 miles by 90 miles .
it has an intact hindu culture .
we had had a wonderful life there , and we decided to do something unusual .
we decided to give back locally .
and here it is : it 's called the green school .
i know it does n't look like a school , but it is something we decided to do , and it is extremely , extremely green .
the classrooms have no walls .
the desks are not square .
at green school , the children are smiling — an unusual thing for school , especially for me .
and we practice holism .
the people that built my school also built the prison and the insane asylum out of the same materials .
so if this gentleman had had a holistic education , would he be sitting there ?
would he have had more possibilities in his life ?
these bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree .
so we basically turned the box into a bubble .
and these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future .
we pay the bill at the end of the month , but the people that are really going to pay the bill are our grandchildren .
and this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world , in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river .
when the turbine drops in , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
these are compost toilets , and nobody at the school wanted to know about them , especially the principal .
and they work . people use them . people are okay .
it 's something you should think about doing .
not many things did n't work .
the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months .
the teachers dragged giant pvc whiteboards into the classrooms .
so we had some good ideas : we took old automobile windshields , put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard .
green school sits in south-central bali , and it 's on 20 acres of rolling garden .
there 's an amazing river traveling through it , and you can see there how we manage to get across the river .
`` in august i 'm bringing my sons . '' '' this was a great thing . ''
but more than that , people are building green houses around green school , so their kids can walk to school on the paths .
and people are bringing their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , to the green school .
there are no sidewalks .
he 's planning to eat that fence for dinner .
and when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gate , they found out the fence was made out of tapioca .
landscaping .
these young ladies are living in a rice culture , but they know something that few people know in a rice culture .
they know how to plant organic rice , they know how to look after it , they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it .
it 's a school where you do learn reading — one of my favorites — writing — i was bad at it — arithmetic .
but you also learn other things .
you learn bamboo building .
the kids love it .
`` ( laughter ) we 've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives , and we said , okay , local , what does `` '' local '' '' mean ? ''
local means that 20 percent of the population of the school has to be balinese , and this was a really big commitment .
and we were right .
a woman came from africa with music .
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global , green leaders .
we need someone to come and study it .
but what 's happening , our learning-different kids — dyslexic — we 've renamed them prolexic — are doing well in these beautiful , beautiful classrooms .
and how did we do all this ?
on giant grass .
it 's bamboo .
it comes out of the ground like a train .
the yellow box was called the administration complex .
`` ( laughter ) we squashed it , we rethought it , but mainly we renamed it `` the heart of school , '' and that changed everything forever . ''
it 's a double helix .
`` and the problem of building it — when the balinese workers saw long reams of plans , they looked at them and said , `` '' what 's this ? '' '' so we built big models . ''
and balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers , selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age-old techniques , mostly by hand .
it was chaos .
and the balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do , so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down , we realized that we had a cathedral , a cathedral to green , and a cathedral to green education .
it may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world , but many people believe that it 's the most beautiful .
it 's a model we built for bali .
so , mr. gore , thank you .
and if you 're interested in being involved in finishing green school and building the next 50 around the world , please come and see us .
what is a parent ? what is a parent ?
shall we tell our child about the sperm donation ?
but i will also show you the parents ' uncertainties .
at this point , none of the children started mentioning the donor .
so , i asked them about their birth story .
`` can you tell me how you came into the family ? '' '' and they explained . ''
he 's not part of my family .
but i will not put him on the ground .
i think he should be in the trunk , because he made my family possible .
diy .
they even had the hospital parking tickets in there .
and these stories were highly diverse , but they all had one thing in common : it was a tale of longing for a child and a quest for that child .
underlying was a fear that their children might disapprove and would reject the non-genetic parent .
well .
i want to tell you about a teenage boy .
now , the boy soon felt sorry , and they made up .
but it is the reaction of his father that is most interesting .
these parents , too .
but they also sometimes wondered : am i a real parent ?
even 10 years later , they still remember the advice they were given .
so when they thought about the counselor and the advice they were given , we discussed that .
`` like , `` '' milk — is that made in a factory ? '' '' we will say , `` '' no , it comes from cows , '' '' and we will talk about the farmer , and the way the milk ends up in the shop . ''
so , you know , i have a friend at school , and she 's made in the same way .
remember the books and the trip to the farmer ?
and we do not need to be professionals to create those .
most of us do just fine , although it may be hard work , and from time to time , we can do with some advice .
in that case , bear in mind three things .
work with advice that works for your family .
thank you .
i met a guy — the guy on the left .
his name was ben .
that gets your adrenaline going .
so let 's go back to sudan .
there 's just one of them .
all of those things are part of that equation .
how is a consumer going to walk through this minefield ?
we need oxford to work with cambridge .
eight entities came to the table .
it 's a pre-competitive issue .
when you get sick , it is a bug in your genome .
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out .
and then , of course , to bring us to today .
meet tony . he 's my student .
he 's about my age , and he 's in san quentin state prison .
`` when tony was 16 years old , one day , one moment , `` '' it was mom 's gun . ''
just flash it , scare the guy . he 's a punk .
he took some money ; we 'll take his money . that 'll teach him .
`` then last minute , i 'm thinking , 'ca n't do this . this is wrong . ' my buddy says , 'c'mon , let 's do this . ' i say , 'let 's do this . ' '' '' and those three words , tony 's going to remember , because the next thing he knows , he hears the pop . ''
`` so when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and i say , `` '' in this class , we will discuss the foundations of ethics , '' '' tony interrupts me . ''
i am told every day , by every face i see , every wall i face , that i am wrong .
if i ever get out of here , there will always be a mark by my name .
you think you know right and wrong ?
i want to know about wrongness itself , the idea of wrong .
what is that idea ?
how do we know that it 's wrong ? maybe you and i disagree .
maybe it 's you , maybe it 's me — but we 're not here to trade opinions ; everyone 's got an opinion .
we are here for knowledge .
`` `` '' could be i 'm wrong . i 'm tired of being wrong . ''
i want to know what is wrong .
socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
he learns his whys and wherefores , his causes and correlations , his logic , his fallacies .
tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous , the epistemologically anxious , the ethically dubious , the metaphysically ridiculous .
that 's plato , descartes , nietzsche and bill clinton .
`` so when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , i say , `` '' i do n't know . ''
thank you .
reality , though — i call it real intelligence .
ed cage : yeah , yeah , yeah !
or we 'll be in the kitchen cooking , road trips , airports .
ec : yeah .
get on up ! come on , stretch !
`` `` '' paradise is in this body . ''
how about a moderate amount of stress ?
yeah . me too .
it increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease .
but i have changed my mind about stress , and today , i want to change yours .
let me start with the study that made me rethink my whole approach to stress .
when you change your mind about stress , you can change your body 's response to stress .
and unbeknownst to you , the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it .
and participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance , well , they were less stressed out , less anxious , more confident , but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed .
it 's not really healthy to be in this state all the time .
and we just did a little intervention .
now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from , so we are going to do one more intervention .
oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family .
it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about .
it 's a stress hormone .
your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response .
it 's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound .
okay , so how is knowing this side of stress going to make you healthier ?
okay , so the bad news first : for every major stressful life experience , like financial difficulties or family crisis , that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent .
people who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying .
stress gives us access to our hearts .
and when you choose to view stress in this way , you 're not just getting better at stress , you 're actually making a pretty profound statement .
you 're saying that you can trust yourself to handle life 's challenges .
( applause ) chris anderson : this is kind of amazing , what you 're telling us .
why ca n't we convert our anger for the larger good of society ?
but it has given birth to a new idea .
i had been a big admirer of mahatma gandhi since my childhood .
why ca n't we celebrate it differently ?
and they are treated as untouchables .
i went to some low-caste , so-called untouchable , people , tried to convince them , but it was unthinkable for them .
`` we can bring about change in the society . '' '' the day has come . ''
i could recall that they had used the best of their clothes .
they brought new utensils .
they had taken baths hundreds of times because it was unthinkable for them to do .
they gathered . food was cooked .
it was 10 o'clock .
and suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder .
how did they punish me ?
but i decided to outcaste the entire caste system .
so i decided to drop my name .
does anybody know ?
so i 'll come back to the story of when i was caught in the prison : i was very happy freeing a dozen children from slavery , handing them over to their parents .
in europe and america , we have been successful .
( applause ) not only that , but this first-ever consumer 's power , or consumer 's campaign has grown in other countries and other industries , maybe chocolate , maybe apparel , maybe shoes — it has gone beyond .
and the concrete result was that the number of child laborers globally has gone down by one third in the last 15 years .
and the angriest among us
thank you so much .
and in the life that everyone sees , who i am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .
it 's a massive problem .
and so because we do n't see it , we do n't see the severity of it .
i was suicidal , and if you were to look at my life on the surface , you would n't see a kid who was suicidal .
you would be wrong . so i sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and i thought about taking my own life and i came this close to doing it . i came this close to doing it .
you do n't beat it once and it 's gone forever .
it 's the roommate you ca n't kick out . it 's the voice you ca n't ignore .
that 's what makes you hold it in and hide it .
i wish i did , but i do n't — but i think , i think it has to start here .
you 're wrong , because it 's the opposite .
we 're people , and we have problems .
so we need to stop the ignorance , stop the intolerance , stop the stigma , and stop the silence , and we need to take away the taboos , take a look at the truth , and start talking , because the only way we 're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together , by standing strong together .
i believe that we can . thank you guys so much .
`` `` '' am i too late ? ''
now , this is scary .
he apologized .
sacrifice your ego .
you 're not meant to be static characters .
and here 's what that means for us .
i was one too .
eventually i got an interview .
thank you .
my wife fernanda does n't like the term , but a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer and my parents and grandparents had it .
every monday and thursday , i 'm going use my terminal days .
but the fact is that , leisure is a very busy thing .
but very few of us know what to do with idleness .
so we started thinking about that as a company for the last 30 years .
and we 'll do it like this , we 'll sell you back your wednesdays for 10 percent of your salary .
so now , if you were going to be a violinist , which you probably were n't , you go and do this on wednesday .
why are we building these headquarters ?
so we started asking questions one by one .
anyone who 's interested in interviewing , you will show up .
and then , come back .
spend an afternoon , spend a whole day , talk to anybody you want .
make sure we are the bride you thought we were and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads .
every six months , everyone gets evaluated , anonymously , as a leader .
and this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position , which is many times situational , as you know .
we said things like , why ca n't people set their own salaries ?
there 's only three things you need to know : how much people make inside the company , how much people make somewhere else in a similar business and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it .
so let 's give people these three pieces of information .
and this is 25 years ago .
do n't tell us where you are .
so for example , many times , what 's the smartest or the intelligent decision does n't jive .
so we 'd say things like , let 's agree that you 're going to sell 57 widgets per week .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so the process is looking for wisdom .
and in the process , of course , we wanted people to know everything , and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things .
so our board had two seats open with the same voting rights , for the first two people who showed up .
and the fact is that they kept us honest .
how am i supposed to work ? where am i going to be in 5 years ' time ?
we said , oh , kindergarten seems like a good place .
so we set up a foundation , which now has , for 11 years , three schools , where we started asking the same questions , how do you redesign school for wisdom ?
`` a tutor , in the old sense of the greek `` '' paideia '' '' : look after the kid . ''
( laughter ) now , we 'll bring in people who have two things : passion and expertise , and it could be their profession or not .
so we have violinists teaching math .
we have all kinds of things where we say , do n't worry about the course material anymore .
we have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17 .
so that 's a big part of what we do .
so can you all hit yourself on the head ?
and they have a zero to 100 percent grading , which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours .
until we know they 're 37 percent of the way we 'd like them to be on this issue , so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it .
and people will sign up for a 45-day course on building a bicycle .
and that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life .
( applause ) i taught mbas at mit for a time and i ended up , one day , at the mount auburn cemetery .
and that did two things .
and the second thing is , i freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever .
i 'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days .
i 've gone down 60 meters to see hammerhead sharks .
we started three new companies in the last two years .
the second why , it starts getting difficult .
`` are there any times you 've seen some big company take on one of your ideas and you 've gone , `` '' yes ! '' '' ? ''
i 'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal , but that 's a very personal one .
it will have to come from kids and other people who are starting companies in a different way .
you 're running a company with a 90-day mandate .
( laughter ) ca : what you 're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound .
no one thinks that we 've caught up yet to a world where there 's google and all these technological options .
so you 've got actual evidence now that the kids so far going through your system , there 's a dramatic increase in performance .
it 's something that will flourish on its own .
and i 'm afraid of the other one , which says , this is so good you 've got to do this .
let 's set up a system and put lots of money into it and then people will do it no matter what .
ca : so you have asked extraordinary questions your whole life .
do you have any other questions for us , for ted , for this group here ?
we have variations of this one question , from three onwards .
so when you spend time in a company , in a bureaucracy , in an organization and you 're saying , boy — how many people do you know who on their death beds said , boy , i wish i had spent more time at the office ?
and it will be okay , it will be much better than what you 're doing , if you 're stuck in a process .
ricardo semler , thank you so much .
( applause )
there 's another one coming out , she also has a number on her .
it 's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality .
because when i was a kid , i also played a lot of guitar .
there are some dilemmas you see .
in all cases , the life support was removed , and the infants had died .
governments are still incentivized to give .
the educated blamed the less well-educated .
was it something that took place overnight ?
hindsight is a wonderful thing .
those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously .
but more profoundly , the vote teaches us something about the nature of politics today .
contemporary politics is no longer just about right and left .
it 's about globalization .
they represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders in ways that many of us would reject .
when we look at the voting patterns across the united kingdom , we can visibly see the divisions .
it means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand .
but for a significant majority of the leave voters the concern was disillusionment with the political establishment .
this replicates around europe and much of the liberal democratic world .
we see it with the rise in popularity of donald trump in the united states , with the growing nationalism of viktor orbán in hungary , with the increase in popularity of marine le pen in france .
the consensus amongst international relations scholars is that globalization brings interdependence , which brings cooperation and peace .
but globalization also has redistributive effects .
to take the example of migration , we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances .
that was the speech in which he coined that term .
`` bigotry and ignorance are the ugly face of exclusionary and antagonistic globalization . '' '' that idea of inclusive globalization was briefly revived in 2008 in a conference on progressive governance involving many of the leaders of european countries . ''
globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda .
and i think , as a social scientist , that social science offers some places to start .
our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change , and i want to give you four ideas as a starting point .
the first relates to the idea of civic education .
and that ca n't just be something that 's left to our schools , although that 's important to begin at an early age .
so we need to encourage exchange programs .
this illustration from the financial times post-brexit is really striking .
but the problem is that those people in those areas did n't perceive themselves to be beneficiaries .
there 's very little social science evidence that compares attitudes on globalization .
but one hypothesis that i think emerges from a cursory look at that data is the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization .
i am still a global citizen .
the space on board and the resources would be limited .
and what if those crops would then make more seeds , enabling you to feed the entire crew with just those few packets of seeds for the duration of the trip ?
well , the scientists at nasa actually figured out a way to do this .
and they also used hydrogen from water .
astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide , that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a nutritious , carbon-rich crop .
but the thing is , that research did n't really go anywhere .
we have n't yet gone to mars . we have n't yet gone to another planet .
so we said , well , earth is actually like a spaceship .
so we began cultivating these products , these microbes , in our lab .
we began cultivating them even further , and we found that we can make oil .
well , modern agriculture simply can not sustainably scale to meet that demand .
let me give you a specific example .
so let me make this real for you .
if you enjoy a beer from your local microbrewery — a product of microbes .
these are all products of microbes .
ten thousand times over a period of a year .
so this is what i mean by a new type of agriculture .
but it does n't have to be this way .
thank you very much .
what happens when people expect something from their physiology ?
you guys have very insecure computers , ok ?
in each little drop of water , you get 50 billion of these guys .
i have been teaching for a long time , and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that i really wish more people would understand about the potential of students .
she went to school to get the information because that 's where the information lived .
fast-forward a generation : this is the one-room schoolhouse , oak grove , where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse .
and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher , stored it in the only portable memory he has , which is inside his own head , and take it with him , because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world .
this was different than either generation had experienced before , and it changed the way i interacted with information even at just a small level .
but the information was closer to me .
i could get access to it .
in the time that passes between when i was a kid in high school and when i started teaching , we really see the advent of the internet .
i did n't tell them what to do or how to do it .
they produced flyers . they called offices .
they checked schedules . they were meeting with secretaries .
`` the older teachers — more experienced — looked at me and went , `` oh , there she is . that 's so cute . she 's trying to get that done . '' ''
`` ( laughter ) `` she does n't know what she 's in for . '' ''
but i knew that the kids would show up , and i believed it , and i told them every week what i expected out of them .
and that night , all 90 kids — dressed appropriately , doing their job , owning it .
it meant something to them .
from kansas , i moved on to lovely arizona , where i taught in flagstaff for a number of years , this time with middle school students .
luckily , i did n't have to teach them american government .
the problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful , and they know what to do with it .
i then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life , or in their own story , or in their own world , that they could identify that had done a similar thing .
it was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves , what they 're willing to share .
the things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary .
fast-forward to pennsylvania , where i find myself today .
we are a nine through 12 public school , but we do school quite differently .
i moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that i knew that kids learned , and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past , of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when i was in school , and to a moment when we have information surplus .
so what do you do when the information is all around you ?
we deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test , and i am here to share with you : it is not learning .
to ask them to always have the right answer does n't allow them to learn .
i almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure .
they can talk — they 're very smooth , and they can write very , very well , but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them .
and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint .
this was done in like two or three days .
and this is the work of the student that consistently did it .
`` and there 's some ... `` '' and they went through all that we processed out loud . ''
`` and i said , `` '' go read it . '' '' and they 're like , `` '' oh , that one was n't so awesome . '' '' and then we went to another one — it did n't have great visuals , but it had great information — and spent an hour talking about the learning process , because it was n't about whether or not it was perfect , or whether or not it was what i could create . ''
there are a million pictures that i could click through here , and had to choose carefully — this is one of my favorites — of students learning , of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information , but instead , ask them what they can do with it .
this is one of my favorite photos , because this was taken on tuesday , when i asked the students to go to the polls .
this is robbie , and this was his first day of voting , and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that .
but this is learning too , because we asked them to go out into real spaces .
and everything that everybody is talking about today is n't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities , because we wo n't get there with a standardized test , and we wo n't get there with a culture of one right answer .
( applause )
i know i must sound like some liberal do-gooder .
how did this happen , reasonable people might ask .
is it more complicated than i 'm making out ?
balancing the power of capitalists like me and workers is n't bad for capitalism .
( applause )
but before i do that , i want to talk a little bit about the past .
now , the reason for the dominance of this model is of course the antibiotic revolution .
and it 's worked , but it 's only worked partly .
the rest is chemical darkness .
so what do we do about this idea ?
what if we reorganized this approach ?
take a disease like cancer .
and finally there 's the level of the environment , is n't there ?
it 's called a prison .
we 're trying to change the metabolic milieu for other forms of cancer .
and so what had happened , really , is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift .
and then the next question was , are there organs ?
could your medicine be a cell and not a pill ?
how would we grow these cells ?
what if the organ needed to have memory ?
could you patent an environment ?
i 've talked a lot about models . i began this talk with models .
he or she is trying to create a new way of seeing .
but we need new models to think about medicine in the future .
( applause ) chris anderson : i really like this metaphor .
how does it link in ?
this is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways .
he stayed late at night every day .
every night he was enjoying his work , he was staying late , he was perfecting this powerpoint presentation .
we basically eliminated it .
and this is basically the result we had before .
`` it was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say , `` '' here is my cake . '' '' no , it was somebody else 's cake , as if you bought it in the store . ''
but imagine this was slightly different .
( applause )
but i think in my career that 's been a good thing .
it turns out that tears just are n't much help when you 're trying to investigate a genocide .
when that last drop of cooking oil finally ran out .
as his eyes grew cloudy and dim .
we whose kids have plenty to eat .
but here 's the part that you might not hear very much about .
and griselda 's not the only one .
the truth is , the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence .
in fact , half a century of anti-poverty programs have left more poor people in slavery than in any other time in human history .
so for me , as a lawyer , of course , my first reaction was to think , well , of course we 've got to change all the laws .
but not a word about the rapists who are still right there in the community .
and yet , for some reason , this is okay for poor people .
the path forward is really pretty clear .
( applause ) chris anderson : really powerfully argued .
talk to us a bit about some of the things that have actually been happening to , for example , boost police training .
gh : well , one of the glorious things that 's starting to happen now is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious .
there 's actually , now , political will to do that .
gh : in guatemala , for instance , we 've started a project there with the local police and court system , prosecutors , to retrain them so that they can actually effectively bring these cases .
and we 've seen prosecutions against perpetrators of sexual violence increase by more than 1,000 percent .
gary haugen .
( applause )
i ca n't move my body to the beat , and after a scientist who became a philosopher , i have to talk about hard science .
it could be a very dry subject .
yet , i feel honored .
usually , talking about science is like exercising in a dry place .
`` the words `` '' water '' '' and `` '' dry '' '' do not match , right ? ''
so this is what inspired me .
that 's why i 'm here , although i 'm carrying my head over here .
we know that there is controversy .
we also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity .
`` the indians say , `` '' the forest has more eyes than leaves . '' '' that is true , and i will try to show you something . ''
we 'll start by thinking that water is like blood .
we 'll start by talking about the power of all these processes .
this is an image of rain in motion .
it 's a powerful engine .
what you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the amazon .
what phenomenon — if it 's not a desert , what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power that it can be seen from space ?
what phenomenon is this ?
it could be a geyser .
there are no geysers in the amazon , unless i am wrong .
i do n't know of any .
but we have something that plays the same role , with much more elegance though : the trees , our good old friends that , like geysers , can transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere .
just to give you an idea .
any idea ? a really big kettle .
a gigantic kettle , right ?
if you look at the world map — it 's easy to see this — you 'll see that there are forests in the equatorial zone , and deserts are organized at 30 degrees north latitude , 30 degrees south latitude , aligned .
it 's on the line of deserts .
where are the arteries ?
any guess ?
there is a new type of river , which originates in the blue sea , which flows through the green ocean — it not only flows , but it is also pumped by the green ocean — and then it falls on our land .
all our economy , that quadrangle , 70 percent of south america 's gdp comes from that area .
this river flows invisibly above us .
it 's a bit dry and rough , but we are floating here , and there is this invisible river running above us .
this river has a pulse .
you can see the different seasons there .
scientists study how it works , why , etc .
and these studies are generating a series of discoveries , which are absolutely fabulous , to raise our awareness of the wealth , the complexity , and the wonder that we have , the symphony we have in this process .
then , clouds are formed and there is torrential rain .
the sprinkler of the garden of eden .
this relation between a living thing , which is the forest , and a nonliving thing , which is the atmosphere , is ingenious in the amazon , because the forest provides water and seeds , and the atmosphere forms the rain and gives water back , guaranteeing the forest 's survival .
when humid air , high humidity and radiation are combined with these organic compounds , which i call exogenous vitamin c , generous vitamin c in the form of gas , the plants release antioxidants which react with pollutants .
speaking of fractals , and their relation with the way we work , we can establish other comparisons .
this keeps the excess of dust from affecting the rainfall .
there is another fractal analogy .
like in the veins and arteries , the rain water is a feedback .
it returns to the atmosphere .
like endocrinal glands and hormones , there are those gases which i told you about before , that are formed and released into the atmosphere , like hormones , which help in the formation of rain .
like the liver and the kidneys , as i 've said , cleaning the air .
we call it the biotic moisture pump , a new theory that is explained in a very simple way .
the desert is trapped in this condition . it will always be dry .
this image shows those paths , all the hurricanes that have been recorded .
you can see that , in the red square , there hardly are any hurricanes .
this pump that sucks the moisture into the continent also speeds up the air above the sea , and this prevents hurricane formations .
to close this part and sum up , i 'd like to talk about something a little different .
i have several colleagues who worked in the development of these theories .
they think , and so do i , that we can save planet earth .
i 'm not talking only about the amazon .
we did n't understand these processes before because the rest of the world is messed up .
we could understand it here , though .
having closed this quick introduction , we see the reality that we have out here , which is drought , this climate change , things that we already knew .
`` i 've been studying this for 20 years , with a super computer , dozens , thousands of scientists , and we are starting to get to this conclusion , which he already knows ! '' '' a critical point is the yanomami have never deforested . ''
this bugged me and i was befuddled .
how could he know that ?
`` why am i doing all this science to get to a conclusion that he already knows ? '' '' then , something absolutely critical hit me , which is , seeing is believing . ''
if we do n't see , we do n't register the information .
we live in ignorance .
we 're trampling on this wonderful cosmos that shelters us and houses us .
the earth is a statistical improbability .
then , let 's turn hubble in our direction , and let 's look at the earth .
let 's dive , let 's reach out the reality we live in every day , and look carefully at it , since that 's what we need .
davi kopenawa does n't need this .
i think that i missed this , an ancestral record , a valuation of what i do n't know , what i have n't seen .
he is not a doubting thomas .
even with hubble up there — this is a bird's-eye view , right ?
even when this happens , we also see something that we do n't know .
the spanish called it the green inferno .
so , you can figure out why they called it the green inferno .
but go and look at what is in there .
we are tech-arrogant .
a robotic hand is technological , mine is biological , and we do n't think about it anymore .
let 's then look at the morpho butterfly , an example of an invisible technological competence of life , which is at the very heart of our possibility of surviving on this planet , and let 's zoom in on it . again , hubble is there .
let 's get into the butterfly 's wings .
let 's zoom in on it .
besides its beauty and functioning , there is another side to it .
this function of the morpho butterfly — it is not blue ; it does not have blue pigments .
hitachi has now made a monitor that uses this technology , and it is used in optical fibers to transmit — janine benyus , who 's been here several times , talks about it : biomimetics .
my time 's up .
it is a structure with a few microns , which is an internal wonder .
imagine what is out there in the amazon forest : 100 trillion . this is greater than the number of stars in the sky .
thank you so much . ( applause )
so , how do we make and understand metaphors ?
metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery .
einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play .
and on my dive , i went down 18,000 feet , to an area that i thought would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor .
i led three diving expeditions to antarctica .
and i 'm going to tell you that story here in a moment .
so where are the phoenix islands ?
let me give you a little peek here of the phoenix islands-protected area .
so i thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever , but they did finally come to an end .
and that 's the area again .
and what 's the context of the phoenix islands ?
in the center we have the phoenix islands , which is the subject that i 'm talking about .
they control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean , and that 's between one and two percent of all the ocean water on the planet .
the president of the maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently to highlight the dire straits of these countries .
after i got back , i said , okay , this is amazing , what we found .
it had occurred on land , in rainforests of south america and africa , where landowners had been paid not to cut the trees down .
and conservation international had struck some of those deals .
many , many steps were taken to pull this off .
and it was primarily because kiribati realized that this was in their own self-interest to do this .
then in 2002 , when this was all going full-swing , a coral-bleaching event happened in the phoenix islands .
it was over 32 degrees celsius for six months and it basically killed 60 percent of the coral .
it 's almost like if a person has multiple diseases , it 's hard to get well , you might die , but if you only have one disease to deal with , you can get better .
and the pipa trust board holds that license and pays the country for this .
thank you very much . ( applause )
( video ) samantha : aaaaaah .
( applause )
his name was joe mckenna .
two days after that , he spiked a fever .
they flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital .
there was nothing they could do because the things we use now to cure infections did n't exist yet .
the first test of penicillin , the first antibiotic , was three years in the future .
people who got infections either recovered , if they were lucky , or they died .
all of that changed when antibiotics arrived .
it seemed like a miracle , and ever since , we have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs .
in fact , they already are .
other bacteria , to protect themselves , evolve defenses against that chemical attack .
here is what happened next : penicillin was distributed in 1943 , and widespread penicillin resistance arrived by 1945 .
vancomycin arrived in 1972 , vancomycin resistance in 1988 .
imipenem in 1985 , and resistance to in 1998 .
daptomycin , one of the most recent drugs , in 2003 , and resistance to it just a year later in 2004 .
a project chartered by the british government known as the review on antimicrobial resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700,000 deaths a year .
if we lost antibiotics , here 's what else we 'd lose : first , any protection for people with weakened immune systems — cancer patients , aids patients , transplant recipients , premature babies .
a recent study estimates that without antibiotics , one out of ever six would die .
next , we 'd probably lose surgery .
we 'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor .
more than anything else , we 'd lose the confident way we live our everyday lives .
after all , the first person to receive penicillin , a british policeman named albert alexander , who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye , was infected by doing something very simple .
he walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn .
penicillin was sold over the counter until the 1950s .
in much of the developing world , most antibiotics still are .
and that 's just in healthcare .
aquaculture depends on antibiotics too , particularly in asia , and fruit growing relies on antibiotics to protect apples , pears , citrus , against disease .
there are companies working on novel antibiotics , things the superbugs have never seen before .
here 's why : evolution always wins .
bacteria birth a new generation every 20 minutes .
it takes pharmaceutical chemistry 10 years to derive a new drug .
there has never yet been a drug they could not defeat .
those are the tech solutions .
antibiotic resistance is a habit .
but as a society , we 've done that in the past .
we changed social norms .
we could change social norms around antibiotic use too .
we could forgo giving an antibiotic if we 're not sure it 's the right one .
but we have to do it soon .
in just 70 years , we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster .
( applause )
but in the 1970s , some countries caught up .
but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities .
now ...
let 's go back in time .
in the front of her is a table .
on the table there are 76 objects for pleasure and for pain .
but also the knife , the razor blade , the hammer and the pistol with one bullet .
`` there are instructions which say , `` '' i 'm an object . ''
you can use everything on the table on me .
i was a mess .
i looked at myself in the mirror , and i had a piece of gray hair .
in the theater , the knife is not a knife and the blood is just ketchup .
and we made , for 12 years , performances together .
i started at the yellow sea , and he started from the gobi desert .
you ca n't wash the blood , you never can wash shame off the wars .
and you are getting free time for yourself for the first time .
you go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable .
and i think that human beings right now need a change , and the only change to be made is a personal level change .
is he going to say 10 ?
and you 've got to have a lot of cows , a lot of goats , a lot of money , a lot of land , in order to build a harem .
ninety-seven percent of mammals do not pair up to rear their young ; human beings do .
i 'm not suggesting that we 're not — that we 're necessarily sexually faithful to our partners .
how is technology changing love ?
i study the brain .
we 're seeing new rules and taboos for how to court .
even dating sites are not changing love .
fourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire , and i 've been able to watch who 's naturally drawn to whom .
curious , creative people need people like themselves .
we have natural patterns of mate choice .
but technology is producing one modern trend that i find particularly important .
it 's associated with the concept of paradox of choice .
today 's singles want to know every single thing about a partner before they wed .
where marriage used to be the beginning of a relationship , now it 's the finale .
it 's not even slow love .
it 's actually women piling into the job market in cultures around the world .
the double-income family was the rule .
`` as william butler yeats , the poet , once said , `` love is the crooked thing . '' ''
`` i would add , `` '' nobody gets out alive . '' '' ( laughter ) we all have problems . ''
but in fact , i think the poet randall jarrell really sums it up best .
`` he said , `` '' the dark , uneasy world of family life — where the greatest can fail , and the humblest succeed . '' '' but i will leave you with this : love and attachment will prevail , technology can not change it . ''
and i will conclude by saying any understanding of human relationships must take into account one the most powerful determinants of human behavior : the unquenchable , adaptable and primordial human drive to love .
thank you .
let 's have her join us on the stage .
esther ?
esther perel : it 's interesting , because on the one hand , the need for love is ubiquitous and universal .
and we have shifted it to a model of free choice and individual rights , and self-fulfillment and happiness .
and at the same time , as you talk about this cognitive overload , i see many , many people who ...
so , here on the internet you have three major ones .
and then comes ghosting .
but i do n't always know the degree to which a changing context ...
there 's two basic parts of personality : there 's your culture — everything you grew up to do and believe and say — and there 's your temperament .
five years ago , i was a ph.d. student living two lives .
and one day , i was thinking about how all data has a location , and i realized that the answer had been staring me in the face .
although i was a satellite engineer , i had n't thought about using satellite imagery in my work .
how much oil is stored in all of china ?
now , in theory , all of these questions could be answered by imagery , but not if it 's old .
so the story begins over 50 years ago with the launch of the first generation of u.s. government photo reconnaissance satellites .
because there are n't very many of them , the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old .
why do these things have to be so expensive ?
does a single satellite really have to cost the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets ?
this dropped the cost of putting objects up there by over a factor of 100 , and suddenly we could afford to experiment , to take a little bit of risk , and to realize a lot of innovation .
now people use these because they get a lot of light , which means less of the noise you see in a low-cost cell phone image .
so instead , we turned to a new generation of video sensors , originally created for use in night vision goggles .
so why do all of this ? why build these satellites ?
well , it turns out imaging satellites have a unique ability to provide global transparency , and providing that transparency on a timely basis is simply an idea whose time has come .
( applause )
he was born two and a half years ago , and i had a pretty tough pregnancy because i had to stay still in a bed for , like , eight months .
he got the right apgar index .
so we were pretty reassured by this .
but at the end , 10 days later after he was born , we discovered that he had a stroke .
as you might know , a stroke is a brain injury .
a perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth , and in his case , as you can see , the right part of his brain has gone .
so the effect that this stroke could have on mario 's body could be the fact that he could n't be able to control the left side of his body .
just imagine , if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit , to input to print out a document , but the printer does n't have the right drives , so the same is for mario .
so life had to change .
we needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life .
roberto d'angelo : as you may imagine , unfortunately , we were not ready .
nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities , and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds .
and that has been really a tough time .
questions , some basics , like , you know , why did this happen to us ?
some more tough , like , really , what will be the impact on mario 's life ?
i mean , at the end , will he be able to work ?
i mean , the only real product of our life , at the end , was a failure .
and you know , it was not a failure for ourselves in itself , but it was a failure that will impact his full life .
i mean we went really down , but at the end , we started to look at him , and we said , we have to react .
basically , we spent months doing this with mario .
you have an object , and we showed him how to grab the object .
now , the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains , exactly now , as you watch me doing this , you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions .
we were his mirror .
and the problem , as you might feel , is that we were down , we were depressed , we were looking at him as a problem , not as a son , not from a positive perspective .
we realized that we had to become a better mirror for mario .
we restarted from our strengths , and at the same time we restarted from his strengths .
we love to travel , we love music , we love to be in places like this , and we started to bring mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him .
this short video is from last week .
but we want to share what was the key learning , the key learning that mario drove to us , and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss , and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity .
mario !
and that effort has helped .
but it 's not enough .
up in the left-hand corner is jobana , sintia and bertha .
a few years ago , brianna started to struggle academically .
and her mother was heartbroken over what was happening .
`` one afternoon , theresa was catching up with a group of friends , and one of them said , `` theresa , how are you ? '' ''
the first meeting was her and two other people .
she went from feeling helpless to realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter , with the support of other people who were going through the same struggle .
for real , it 's very secret , he wo n't tell you about it .
but it also presented a gigantic challenge to investigative journalism .
giant corporations operate on a global level .
so it seems staggering that journalism has been so late to cover stories in a truly global way .
there were only two rules for everyone who was invited : we all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else , and we all agreed to publish together on the same day .
i like to refer to johannes kristjansson , the icelandic reporter we invited to join the project , as the loneliest man in the world .
for nine months , he refused paid work and lived off the earnings of his wife .
and he soon ran out of excuses to explain his many absences , as he worked red-eyed , night after night , month after month .
in all that time , he sat on information that would eventually bring down the leader of his country .
`` `` '' wintris is coming , '' '' he used to say . ''
panama papers actually allowed the reporters to look at the world through a different lens from everybody else .
a new leader was elected in argentina .
the fbi began to indict officials at fifa , the organization that controls the world of professional soccer .
the panama papers actually had unique insights into each one of these unfolding events .
the icelandic prime minister had to resign .
these alleged members of a mexican drug cartel were arrested after we published details about their hideout .
they 'd been using the address to register their offshore company .
the technology — the internet — that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself .
we put all-important context around what was given to us by john doe .
`` shortly after we published , i got a three-word text from johannes : `` wintris has arrived . '' ''
i guess you 're going to send that applause to the 350 journalists who worked with you , right ?
now , a couple of questions i would like to ask .
probably the biggest crisis we had was a week before publication .
they thought the story was going to get out .
bg : and then a couple weeks ago or so , you released a lot of the documents as an open database for everybody to search via keyword , essentially .
gr : thank you .
she could n't wait to get out of her parents ' house , to prove to them that she 's an adult , and to prove to her new friends that she belongs .
she can only remember the night in flashes .
hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own .
now , i 'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training .
so when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago , it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change .
we started by talking to college survivors .
you see , knowing that you were n't the only one changes everything .
but the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace .
we do n't have to live in a world where 99 percent of rapists get away with it .
ss : i normally talk about language .
video : this lexigram also refers to a place in the woods .
the bonobo 's abilities have stunned scientists around the world .
good kanzi . very good . thank you so much .
( applause )
and so many people , i guess , watch those videos .
and , right away , i see there 's a different pattern that emerges .
this is because , in the mid-area here , people are at their most active , and over here they 're at their most frail .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we filter by age — say 40 years or less — we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrated ever produced .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
so i 'm looking at this ; i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
`` ( applause ) now , if i want to just kind of take a peek at these , i might think , `` well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? '' ''
so i can step back , and expand on that .
and i see greg lemond now .
it 's in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i 'm only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
now , having selected government , i can now see that the wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are time magazine people of the year .
it 's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular summaries , i can then drill into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
and interestingly enough , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so you see , we 're navigating the web for the first time as if it 's actually a web , not from page-to-page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
so i can drill into what i 've done over specific time frames .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history — here , i was doing some nepotistic searching , looking for bing , over here for live labs pivot .
and from these , i can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
we talk about the curse of information overload .
if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
so with that , i thank you .
life is about opportunities , creating them and embracing them , and for me , that was the olympic dream .
that 's what defined me . that was my bliss .
and i got up off the seat of my bike , and i started pumping my legs , and as i sucked in the cold mountain air , i could feel it burning my lungs , and i looked up to see the sun shining in my face .
i 'd been hit by a speeding utility truck with only 10 minutes to go on the bike ride .
i had extensive and life-threatening injuries .
i broke my right arm . i broke my collarbone .
i was having a really bad day . ( laughter ) for over 10 days , i drifted between two dimensions .
i had an awareness of being in my body , but also being out of my body , somewhere else , watching from above as if it was happening to someone else .
`` `` come on . stay with me . we can do it . we can do it together . '' ''
i was at a crossroads .
i knew if i did n't return to my body , i 'd have to leave this world forever .
it was the fight of my life .
after 10 days , i made the decision to return to my body , and the internal bleeding stopped .
they 'd have to operate .
they went in . they put me on a beanbag . they cut me , literally cut me in half , i have a scar that wraps around my entire body .
`` i woke up in intensive care , and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that stage i had a little bit of movement in one of my big toes , and i thought , `` '' great , because i 'm going to the olympics ! '' '' ( laughter ) i had no idea . that 's the sort of thing that happens to someone else , not me , surely . ''
`` but then the doctor came over to me , and she said , `` '' janine , the operation was a success , and we 've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could , but the damage is permanent . ''
the central nervous system nerves , there is no cure .
you have no feeling from the waist down , and at most , you might get 10- or 20-percent return .
i was an athlete . that 's all i knew . that 's all i 'd done .
they moved me from intensive care to acute spinal .
i had one arm in plaster , one arm tied down by drips .
how amazing is that ? how often in life do you get to make friendships , judgment-free , purely based on spirit ?
i remember one night , one of the nurses came in , jonathan , with a whole lot of plastic straws .
well , there was n't much else to do in the spinal ward , so we did .
`` and we did . and he said , `` '' right . now we 're all connected . '' '' and as we held on , and we breathed as one , we knew we were n't on this journey alone . ''
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same .
after six months , it was time to go home .
i soaked it up and i thought , how could i ever have taken this for granted ?
`` but before i left the hospital , the head nurse had said to me , `` '' janine , i want you to be ready , because when you get home , something 's going to happen . '' '' and i said , `` '' what ? '' '' and she said , `` you 're going to get depressed . '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' not me , not janine the machine , '' '' which was my nickname . ''
`` she said , `` '' you are , because , see , it happens to everyone . ''
i did get depressed .
and i wanted to give up .
all i wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door .
`` and i can remember mom sitting on the end of my bed , and saying , `` '' i wonder if life will ever be good again . '' '' and i thought , `` '' how could it ? because i 've lost everything that i valued , everything that i 'd worked towards . ''
she was always happy , and even when she began to talk again , albeit difficult to understand , she never complained , not once .
and i wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance .
it was life itself . i realized that this was n't just my pain .
`` and then i stopped asking , `` '' why me ? '' '' and i started to ask , `` '' why not me ? '' '' and then i thought to myself , maybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start . ''
i was an athlete . my body was a machine .
and even though i had absolutely no idea what i was going to do , in that uncertainty came a sense of freedom .
i was no longer tied to a set path .
and that realization was about to change my life .
`` sitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast , an airplane flew overhead , and i looked up , and i thought to myself , `` '' that 's it ! ''
`` they said , `` '' you know , when do you want to come out ? '' '' i said , `` '' well , i have to get a friend to drive me out because i ca n't drive . sort of ca n't walk either . ''
they had to slide me up on the wing , put me in the cockpit .
`` he said , `` '' would you like to have a go at taxiing ? '' '' that 's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground . ''
`` and i said , `` '' yeah . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , you take the controls , and you fly towards that mountain . '' '' and as i looked up , i realized that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun . ''
and i was a long , long way from that spinal ward , and i knew right then that i was going to be a pilot .
so i went home , i got a training diary out , and i had a plan .
and then i made great progression to the point where i could walk around the house , holding onto the walls , like this , and mom said she was forever following me , wiping off my fingerprints . ( laughter ) but at least she always knew where i was .
so while the doctors continued to operate and put my body back together again , i went on with my theory study , and then eventually , and amazingly , i passed my pilot 's medical , and that was my green light to fly .
`` and i spent every moment i could out at that flying school , way out of my comfort zone , all these young guys that wanted to be qantas pilots , you know , and little old hop-along me in first my plaster cast , and then my steel brace , my baggy overalls , my bag of medication and catheters and my limp , and they used to look at me and think , `` oh , who is she kidding ? she 's never going to be able to do this . '' ''
and sometimes i thought that too .
and then i learned to fly an airplane with two engines and i got my twin engine rating .
and then i learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather and got my instrument rating .
and then i got my commercial pilot 's license .
and then i got my instructor rating .
`` ( applause ) and then i thought , `` '' why stop there ? ''
and mom and dad ? never been up .
but then i knew for certain that although my body might be limited , it was my spirit that was unstoppable .
`` the philosopher lao tzu once said , `` '' when you let go of what you are , you become what you might be . '' '' i now know that it was n't until i let go of who i thought i was that i was able to create a completely new life . ''
it was n't until i let go of the life i thought i should have that i was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me .
i now know that my real strength never came from my body , and although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically , who i am is unchanged .
the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us .
i know that i 'm not my body , and i also know that you 're not yours .
all that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity by living our lives as the ultimate creative expression of who we really are , because we are all connected by millions and millions of straws , and it 's time to join those up and to hang on .
so raise your straws if you 'll join me .
and that 's actually what drew me to the mola in the first place , was this terribly bizarre shape .
so we 've got to figure out how they 're living their lives .
how do you do that with an animal — very few places in the world .
and they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment .
i 'm going to show you our latest dataset .
i set up a website because i was getting so many questions about molas and sunfish .
we do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .
and as a body of knowledge builds up , it will form one subsection , or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the ipcc , although we have others .
now , we can all do something .
( applause )
he asked me if i wanted to interview the red brigades .
they were constantly searching for cash .
it comes back at times of great transformation , globalization being one of those transformations .
it is trillions , it 's not billions .
it was introduced only in the united states .
i just remember a feeling of surprise ; surprise at finding a street with no cars , as opposed to the nearby mass . ave. full of cars ; surprise at finding a street draped by leaves and surrounded by trees .
it has the power to make those handful of directions the definitive direction to that destination .
we are able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy .
`` i would like to end with this thought : do you remember `` '' the truman show ? '' '' it 's a media satire in which a real person does n't know he 's living in a fabricated world . ''
perhaps we live in a world fabricated for efficiency .
why ?
they were not intelligent .
they were illusions , a clever combination of mechanical engineering and the deceptiveness of the conjurer 's art .
edi is different .
mt : he weighs 300 pounds .
edi : i have two seven-axis arms — mt : core of sensing — edi : a 360-degree sonar detection system , and come complete with a warranty .
mt : we love robots .
edi : hi . i 'm edi . will you be my friend ?
the perfect robot will be indistinguishable from the human , and that scares us .
in the first story about robots , they turn against their creators .
it 's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction .
your world is ours . you — mt : as i was saying , besides the faces and bodies we give our robots , we can not read their intentions , and that makes us nervous .
edi : wow !
edi : you know , humans are so unpredictable , not to mention irrational .
accidents are inevitable .
much as the victorians faked their mechanical marvels , we can add a layer of deception to help us feel more comfortable with our robotic friends .
with that in mind , i set about teaching edi a magic trick .
ready , edi ? edi : uh , ready , marco .
abracadabra .
mt : abracadabra ?
edi : yeah . it 's all part of the illusion , marco .
mt : magic creates the illusion of an impossible reality .
to create the robotic illusion , we 've devised a set of ethical rules , a code that all robots would live by .
edi : a robot may not harm humanity , or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm .
we give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice .
edi : i am edi .
most important , we make them indicate that they are aware of our presence .
edi : marco , you 're standing on my foot !
( music ) thank you .
what is it , the cartoon ? is it really about lemmings ?
the last year has seen the invention of a new four-letter word .
many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world , in the millions , for free .
now , our classrooms could use change .
so , here 's a classroom at this little three-letter institute in the northeast of america , mit .
the seats are in color .
education really has n't changed in the past 500 years .
everything else has changed around us .
so what you see here is not a rock concert .
and the person you see at the end of the stage is not madonna .
now , we 've all heard of distance education , but the students way in the back , 200 feet away from the instructor , i think they are undergoing long-distance education .
now , i really believe that we can transform education , both in quality and scale and access , through technology .
given education has been calcified for 500 years , we really can not think about reengineering it , micromanaging it .
we really have to completely reimagine it .
it 's like going from ox carts to the airplane .
even the infrastructure has to change .
we have to go to interactive virtual laboratories and gamification .
we have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards .
so at edx and a number of other organizations , we are applying these technologies to education through moocs to really increase access to education .
and we had no marketing budget .
now , 155,000 is a big number .
7,200 is also a big number .
if i were to teach at mit two semesters every year , i would have to teach for 40 years before i could teach this many students .
now these large numbers are just one part of the story .
we are taking what we develop and learn in the large and applying it in the small to the classroom , to create a blended model of learning .
but before i go into that , let me tell you a story .
`` silence . ( laughter ) `` can you listen to me ? '' ''
so we had a real issue with communicating , and we were just not communicating , until one day i had this epiphany .
i texted her . ( laughter ) i got an instant response .
i said , no , that must have been by accident .
so i texted her again . boom , another response .
i said , this is great .
and so since then , our life has changed .
now , i 'm older , and my youthful looks might belie that , but i 'm not in the millennial generation .
let 's not fight it . let 's embrace it .
so here 's what we can do .
so instead what you do is you have them watch videos and do interactive exercises in the comfort of their dorm rooms , in their bedroom , in the dining room , in the bathroom , wherever they 're most creative .
they can have discussions amongst themselves .
they can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions .
and the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog .
we were also doing other pilots .
so there , the students would , again , the instructors flipped the classroom , blended online and in person , and the results were staggering .
now do n't take these results to the bank just yet .
just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more , but the early results are incredible .
with this blended class late last year , the failure rate fell to nine percent .
what are some key ideas that makes all of this work ?
one idea is active learning .
lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises .
so a student might watch a five- , seven-minute video and follow that with an interactive exercise .
and this is a form of learning called active learning , and really promoted by a very early paper , in 1972 , by craik and lockhart , where they said and discovered that learning and retention really relates strongly to the depth of mental processing .
the second idea is self-pacing .
i was n't all that smart , and i would be scrambling , taking notes , and then i would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour .
they can hit the pause button .
heck , they can even mute the professor .
i mean , how else do you teach 150,000 students ?
some are never graded .
if they get it wrong , they can get instant feedback .
learners are telling us that they go to bed at night dreaming of the green check mark .
`` in fact , one of our learners who took the circuits course early last year , he then went on to take a software course from berkeley at the end of the year , and this is what the learner had to say on our discussion board when he just started that course about the green check mark : `` oh god ; have i missed you . '' ''
you know , all learners engage really well with interactive videos and so on .
you know , they would sit down and shoot alien spaceships all day long until they get it .
so we applied these gamification techniques to learning , and we can build these online laboratories .
how do you teach creativity ? how do you teach design ?
we can do this through online labs and use computing power to build these online labs .
so as this little video shows here , you can engage students much like they design with legos .
so here , the learners are building a circuit with lego-like ease .
fifth is peer learning .
so here , we use discussion forums and discussions and facebook-like interaction not as a distraction , but to really help students learn .
let me tell you a story .
when we did our circuits course for the 155,000 students , i did n't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course .
they had answered questions for 100 students .
boom , boom , boom , boom , the students were discussing and interacting with each other , and by 4 a.m. that night , i 'm totally fascinated , having this epiphany , and by 4 a.m. in the morning , they had discovered the right answer .
so this is absolutely amazing , where students are learning from each other , and they 're telling us that they are learning by teaching .
so we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and high schools around the world , from tsinghua in china to the national university of mongolia in mongolia to berkeley in california — all over the world .
it can also solve a practical problem of moocs , the business aspect .
they can use as much or as little as they like , and it becomes a tool in the teacher 's arsenal .
finally , i would like to have you dream with me for a little bit .
the aakash is 40 dollars .
we have to move from bricks-and-mortar school buildings to digital dormitories .
otherwise , how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and , you know , you did n't even have a rewind button ?
and you can basically see that the richer a country is , the older the people are within it .
if a newt can do this kind of thing , why ca n't we ?
secondly , we can use materials .
now i 'm going to show you cell-based regeneration .
again , if you 're squeamish , you do n't want to watch .
the good news is that this is happening today .
( laughter ) oh , for al gore to come and be in the real world as president .
to me , words are more like instincts and language .
language is kind of exclusive to our species , anyway .
the photographer told me to look flirty .
`` `` you know , squint . '' ''
my personal heroes were george carlin and stephen colbert — and they taught me humor .
needless to say , i did not have many friends .
the feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles , and so for years , i refused to shower .
and i had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment , but within days of them prescribing a new medication , my life turned into an episode of the walking dead .
and she told me that one time , a man walked in completely naked .
i spent a lot of time thinking if there 's a better way , and i think there is : autism-assistive technology .
now i 'm not a scientist .
let 's create a giant fund .
so we published some articles in the academic press .
doctor : how many are these ?
doctor : what shape do you see here ?
patient : a square and a circle .
the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information .
this is one of the seven surviving sputniks that was not launched into space .
so that’s for fun .
the connection is the energy it takes to run the web , and to make everything we think possible , possible .
i 'm turning 44 next month , and i have the sense that 44 is going to be a very good year , a year of fulfillment , realization .
`` `` he felt his own age , forty-four ... '' ''
there are patterns to life , and they are shared .
i could assemble them into a life , a long life , a hundred-year life , the entirety of that same great sequence through which the luckiest among us pass .
and besides , growing old only postponed the inevitable , time seeing through what circumstance did not .
it was all a bit disheartening .
a list , though , would last .
to chronicle a life year by vulnerable year would be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting , would be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future , whether we made it there or not .
for starters , we now live longer , and so age more slowly .
it had happened to him , as to them .
now the list is done : a hundred years .
and looking back over it , i know that i am not done .
thank you .
`` `` give me liberty or give me death . '' ''
when patrick henry , the governor of virginia , said these words in 1775 , he could never have imagined just how much they would come to resonate with american generations to come .
meanwhile , american ingenuity and innovation has helped to spur industrialization and also helped in the creation and the building of things like household appliances such as refrigerators and televisions , motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets .
`` it 's no surprise , then , that even at the depths of the private capitalism crisis , president obama said , `` '' the question before us is not whether the market is a force for good or ill . ''
this schism has only grown wider .
`` `` give me liberty or give me death '' is all well and good if you can afford it , but if you 're living on less than one dollar a day , you 're far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy . ''
what if you had to choose between a roof over your head and the right to vote ?
i 've met with presidents , dissidents , policymakers , lawyers , teachers , doctors and the man on the street , and through these conversations , it 's become clear to me that many people in the emerging markets believe that there 's actually a split occurring between what people believe ideologically in terms of politics and economics in the west and that which people believe in the rest of the world .
now , do n't get me wrong .
of course they would .
the fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the western ideological systems of politics and economics , and this is a system that is embodied by china .
and rather than have private capitalism , they have state capitalism .
instead of liberal democracy , they have de-prioritized the democratic system .
i put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by china that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow , because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time .
she 's been able to produce record economic growth and meaningfully move many people out of poverty , specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty by moving over 300 million people out of indigence .
we see that in china , 28 percent of people had secondary school access .
so in its totality , economic improvement has been quite significant .
second , china has been able to meaningfully improve its income inequality without changing the political construct .
they have vastly different political systems and different economic systems , one with private capitalism , another one broadly with state capitalism .
however , these two countries have the identical gini coefficient , which is a measure of income equality .
this is not just about china building roads and ports and railways in her own country — she 's been able to build 85,000 kilometers of road network in china and surpass that of the united states — but even if you look to places like africa , china has been able to help tar the distance of cape town to cairo , which is 9,000 miles , or three times the distance of new york to california .
perhaps it 's no surprise that in a 2007 pew survey , when surveyed , africans in 10 countries said they thought that the chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins , by as much as 98 percent .
finally , china is also providing innovative solutions to age-old social problems that the world faces .
`` ladies and gentlemen , it 's no surprise that around the world , people are pointing at what china is doing and saying , `` '' i like that . i want that . ''
i want to be able to do what china 's doing .
in particular , there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets , when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth .
in fact , countries like taiwan , singapore , chile , not just china , have shown that actually , it 's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy .
in a recent study , the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last .
and only if your per capita income is above 6,000 dollars a year will you have democracy come hell or high water .
but perhaps it 's also telling us that we should be worried about going around the world and shoehorning democracy , because ultimately we run the risk of ending up with illiberal democracies , democracies that in some sense could be worse than the authoritarian governments that they seek to replace .
the evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing .
well , the world could look like more state involvement and state capitalism ; greater protectionisms of nation-states ; but also , as i just pointed out a moment ago , ever-declining political rights and individual rights .
the question that is left for us in general is , what then should the west be doing ?
the west can either compete or cooperate .
the other option is for the west to cooperate , and by cooperating i mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them .
the fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with china , the west should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions .
instead of criticizing china for bad behavior , the west should be showing how it is that their own system of politics and economics is the superior one .
and instead of shoehorning democracy around the world , perhaps the west should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today .
some people would argue that today there is still no equal rights .
in fact , there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law .
it 's the refrigerators .
`` but the fact of the matter is , although people back in the day used to point at the western countries and say , `` i want that , i like that , '' there 's now a new person in town in the form of a country , china . ''
just to illustrate , i went into my annals of myself .
at the time of my birth , blacks were not issued birth certificates , and that law only changed in 1973 .
i bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years , i 've gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious ted crowd today to talk to you about my views .
we can meaningfully put a dent in poverty .
but also , it 's going to require that we look at our assumptions , assumptions and strictures that we 've grown up with around democracy , around private capitalism , around what creates economic growth and reduces poverty and creates freedoms .
we might have to tear those books up and start to look at other options and be open-minded to seek the truth .
thank you very much .
i certainly did n't .
gabby giffords : yes .
and from that point on , i knew that our lives were going to be a lot different .
pm : and when you arrived at the hospital , what was the prognosis that they gave you about gabby 's condition and what recovery , if any , you could expect ?
pm : and there were certain words , too .
and she 's on a motor scooter there , but it 's my understanding that 's a very tame image of what gabby giffords was like growing up .
mk : yeah , gabby , she used to race motorcycles .
gabby would — gg : fact-finding mission .
gg : no , no , no .
( laughter ) a good friend .
mk : yeah , we were friends for a long time .
mk : yes . our first date was to death row at the florence state prison in arizona , which was just outside gabby 's state senate district .
we 've gone through some tough times and it 's only made it stronger . gg : stronger .
actually , you did n't even live together .
pm : installing solar panels on the top of her house , i have to say .
`` you 've got to find a replacement for me . '' '' so i did n't actually resign from being an astronaut , but i gave up my job and they found a replacement . ''
pm : is that for appetizer or dessert , mark ?
pm : but there was a lot of conversation about something you did , gabby , after mark 's flight .
what 's life like , day to day ?
mk : well , that 's gabby 's service dog nelson .
gg : nelson .
and gabby , what 's on the agenda now ?
gg : americans for responsible solutions .
it 's not too difficult to do that .
he started doing better .
thank you for inviting us here today .
get involved with your community .
be a leader . set an example .
we 've invaded every country we 've encountered .
( applause ) because it 's leaving millions of children behind .
but the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg .
america spends more money on education than most other countries .
class sizes are smaller than in many countries .
the trouble is , it 's all going in the wrong direction .
what schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement .
it 's a real achievement to put that particular ability out , or to stifle it .
there he is . he 's dieting .
our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity .
i mean , you may have a dog .
instead , what we have is a culture of standardization .
it 's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time .
it 's a human system .
in the winter of 2004 , it rained in death valley .
the whole floor of death valley was carpeted in flowers for a while .
great leaders know that .
thank you very much .
( laughter ) yeah , you did .
thank you for putting your hand up over there .
now , when humans think about sex , male and female forms are generally what come to mind , but for many millions of years , such specific categories did n't even exist .
now invariably , you 're probably thinking about what belongs to our own species , these very familiar structures , but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind-blowing .
penile diversity is especially profuse .
it 's a close relative of squid and octopus , and males have a hectocotylus .
just what is a hectocotylus ?
it leaves the [ body of the male ] , finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water , attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm .
now , the tapir is a mammal from south america .
the biggest penis-to-body-size ratio in the animal kingdom actually belongs to the meager beach barnacle , and this video is actually showing you what the human penis would look like if it were the same size as that of a barnacle .
but of course , that does n't exactly happen , and that 's because we ca n't just take form into account .
and these contributions are far from equal .
this is bedbug sex , and it 's aptly termed traumatic insemination .
they stab it anywhere in her body , and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries .
if a female gets too many stab wounds , or if a stab wound happens to become infected , she can actually die from it .
and quite frankly , that 's exactly what it is .
now the female actually gets the last laugh , though , because she can actually manipulate her posture so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors better access to her ovaries .
but orgasm did n't actually evolve until about 65 million years ago with the advent of mammals .
those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all .
now males have been observed to prod the female 's genital opening prior to copulating with her , and in what i have lovingly termed the magnum , p.i . hypothesis , females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found with males that have these fish mustaches .
we 've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way to basically make a female have sex .
i mean , imagine putting a penis into another penis .
it 's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action .
now , even more interesting is the fact that elephant and hyena societies are entirely matriarchal : they 're run by females , groups of females , sisters , aunts and offspring , and when young males attain sexual maturity , they 're turfed out of the group .
so what are my take-home messages from my talk today ?
the sexual strategies and reproductive structures that we see in the animal kingdom basically dictate how males and females will react to each other , which then dictates how populations and societies form and evolve .
so it may not be surprising to any of you that animals , including ourselves , spend a good amount of time thinking about sex , but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it .
( applause )
live it large . live it large .
but there was a pretty big problem with this .
they died of massive infection .
and so here you 're seeing the operation of this wrist .
and then you need to add some more ports , and more .
nowadays , in addressing microbial biodiversity , scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the pacific ocean .
and we need that knowledge .
the encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications .
and those resources are going away .
there is one trickiness about this reaction .
now , why the hell would we bother to do this ?
i wish this were different . we really need it now .
so now we 're going into what we call the living room .
i 'm going to go very , very quickly through this .
clearly , we 're living in a moment of crisis .
arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us , and yet i stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive .
because of the resources , the skills , and certainly the surge of talent we 're seeing all around the world , with the mindset to create change .
and we 've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen , who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower , but that we 've got to engage in a different way with the world .
on the one hand , we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out .
we call it patient capital .
and their policy prescription is to make government more accountable , focus on the capital markets , invest , do n't give anything away .
on the other side , as i said , there are those who say the problem is that we need more money .
they point to the successes of aid : the eradication of smallpox , and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals .
patient capital works between , and tries to take the best of both .
it recognizes that the market has its limitation , and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people .
now , entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons .
first , they tend to work in markets where people make one , two , three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level .
third , they are often creating markets .
and so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time , takes a lot of patience .
it also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance .
not only to build the systems , the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way , but to connect those business to other markets , to governments , to corporations — real partnerships if we want to get to scale .
i want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation .
in 2002 i met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india , who 'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet .
and he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether , despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in india make under a dollar a day .
they were creating subsidies either for large farms , or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use , rather than that the farmers wanted to use .
but the market also had bypassed low income farmers , because these systems were both too expensive , and they were constructed for fields that were too large .
the average small village farmer works on two acres or less .
and he used three fundamental principles .
the drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre , even if he had two , because it was too frightening , given all that he had at stake .
second , it had to be extremely affordable .
in other words , that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest , or else they would n't take the risk .
and third , it had to be what amitabha calls infinitely expandable .
what i mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre , the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth .
as of today , ide india , amitabha 's organization , has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average , but this did n't happen overnight .
in fact , when you go back to the beginning , there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day , that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors , agriculture .
and when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers , that 's when patient capital could come in .
secondarily , we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries .
and so we met dr. sono khangharani in pakistan .
and while , again , you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan , just to get the permits , over time we were able to start a company with dr. sono , who runs a large community development organization in the thar desert , which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country .
and though that company has just started , our assumption is that there too we 'll see the impact on millions .
but drip irrigation is n't the only innovation .
we 're starting to see these happening all around the world .
in arusha , tanzania , a to z textile manufacturing has worked in partnership with us , with unicef , with the global fund , to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people , mostly women .
and they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for africans around the world .
lifespring hospital is a joint venture between acumen and the government of india to bring quality , affordable maternal health care to low-income women , and it 's been so successful that it 's currently building a new hospital every 35 days .
because we 're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people . all of the ones i discussed have reached at least a quarter million people .
but that 's obviously not enough .
and it 's where the idea of partnership becomes so important .
we 've had a rocky relationship with that country and , in all fairness , the united states has not always been a very reliable partner .
and tasneem siddiqui , who developed a way called incremental housing , where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe , affordable community housing .
it 's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the taliban .
i 've invested in pakistan for over seven years now , and those of you who 've also worked there can attest that pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population , and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature .
president kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable .
i would say that the converse is true .
that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day , provide real pathways to hope .
it was about 115 degrees .
and we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color , lots of heat , very little discussion , because we were exhausted .
and finally , at the end of the journey , i could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon .
and as we got closer , its significance became apparent .
that there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall .
because he was building these crops .
and with the money he earned he could stay this year .
and for the first time ever in three generations , his children would go to school .
we asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons .
`` and he said , `` '' of course i will . ''
because at the end of the day , dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth .
martin luther king said that love without power is anemic and sentimental , and that power without love is reckless and abusive .
our generation has seen both approaches tried , and often fail .
but i think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power .
the time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions , a cross sector , is now .
i know it works .
rather than what we think that they might need .
it will take embracing the world with both arms .
thank you .
( applause )
my fellow psychologists have shown that we 're led by our bodies and our emotions and use our puny powers of reason merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact .
look , you 're trying to persuade us of reason 's impotence .
you 're not threatening us or bribing us , suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest .
sp : but can reason lead us in directions that are good or decent or moral ?
can reason force the reasoner to want less cruelty and waste ?
you need two conditions : the first is that reasoners all care about their own well-being .
we all care passionately about our own well-being .
sp : not exactly . i think we still harbor instincts that can erupt in violence , like greed , tribalism , revenge , dominance , sadism .
sp : they can and do .
but all on its own , it 's a feeble instrument for making moral progress .
reason has muscle .
it 's reason that provides the push to widen that circle of empathy .
time and again , a thinker would lay out an argument as to why some practice was indefensible , irrational , inconsistent with values already held .
by now , these things just feel wrong .
one man 's safety is owing to the destruction of another .
the cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning .
whatever is unfortunate in war , is severely so indeed , and whatever , on the contrary , is called good fortune , is a savage and a cruel good fortune , an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another 's woe .
rng : that sort of co-option is all in the job description of reason .
one movement for the expansion of rights inspires another because the logic is the same , and once that 's hammered home , it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to ignore the inconsistency .
on the contrary , it produces pleasure .
rng : the appeal to religion to justify the otherwise unjustifiable , such as the ban on contraception .
sp : what about religious faith in general ?
rng : eh , i 'm not holding my breath .
sp : still , i have become convinced that reason is a better angel that deserves the greatest credit for the moral progress our species has enjoyed and that holds out the greatest hope for continuing moral progress in the future .
that one 's actually true .
and studies show that americans say that most do n't know a muslim .
i 'm a mom , a coffee lover — double espresso , cream on the side .
i 'm an introvert .
i 'm a wannabe fitness fanatic .
i see myself in it . i feel that god knows me .
and then that terrible morning of september , 2001 .
an accident ?
a malfunction ?
my shock quickly turned to outrage .
who would do this ?
i stayed inside all week .
i get it that people were angry at the terrorists .
`` today we hear people actually saying things like , `` '' there 's a problem in this country , and it 's called muslims . ''
you know , a malignant tumor you extract altogether , and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance .
we become more accepting of authoritarianism , conformity and prejudice .
one study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories that were negative about muslims , they became more accepting of military attacks on muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights of american muslims .
now , this is n't just academic .
muslims are like canaries in the coal mine .
( applause ) and assigning collective guilt is n't just about having to explain yourself all the time .
so bigotry is n't just immoral , it can even be lethal .
what will you choose ?
or will you join those who say we are better than that ?
i 'm not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
the problem was you actually had to go to alexandria to go to it .
it is , by far and away , the largest print library in the world .
in india , they 've got another couple bookmobiles running around .
it was quite popularly attended .
one is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a rube goldberg machine .
so the idea of electronic books is starting to come about .
but how do you go about doing all this scanning ?
so we started out trying to figure out . how do we get to 10 cents ?
if we can have mars rovers , you 'd think you could turn pages .
and actually , it turns out to , you know , pay a living wage .
there 's a political and social question out of this .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
now even my seven-year-old brain knew that was n't going to work .
so sometimes fear can produce a constructive response .
on september 11 , 2001 , 19 guys took over four airplanes and flew them into a couple of buildings .
they exacted a horrible toll .
but the response that we had was clearly disproportionate — disproportionate to the point of verging on the unhinged .
we launched two wars .
and so we 're not looking ahead .
and so what are those trends ?
we do n't have the basic ideas formulated .
we do n't know .
it 's a gesture — it 's not a deterrent .
and an ipad .
but it does n't just affect the security side .
but we 're not .
it 's china , india , russia .
we are seeing these changes everywhere we look .
education is changing in the same way .
these are fundamental issues . where are the philosophers ?
and that brings me to the reason that i 'm here .
thank you very , very much .
it 's better than prozac , but i would n't recommend it .
now , why am i telling you this story at this meeting ?
that proved to be a lot of bovine stercus .
nothing happened except that i got jaundiced from one of these things .
`` they just thought , `` '' well , we 'll give a course of 10 . ''
i brought my wife with me , actually , to make sure i could get through this .
why have i chosen , after never , ever talking about this , to talk about it now ?
this is actually very powerful .
and actually when you look at the impacts , the impacts are substantial .
but they are also haunting the dark street of my mind .
we need to find better ways to remember them .
we also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives .
when it happens to you , there is no time for thinking , no time for praying .
i normally do n't talk about this , but i 'd like to share a bit with you some of those 317 days of captivity .
they would bring a big piece of bread , a bowl of soup , and a candle .
i always dreamt of the fifth one .
but darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal .
`` once a guard came to me , very aggressively , and he told me , `` today you 're going to kneel and beg for your food . '' ''
i did n't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little .
submission was the only way for me to make it to another candle .
and we talked until the last song on the tape .
two days after , i was transferred to another place .
he probably meant well .
months after my release , i met the then-french prime minister .
after my release , i was told not to seek any form of justice .
this is inexcusable .
we must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers are attacks against humanity itself .
i do n't know what it is to lose the protection of my country .
latin america is ground zero for both of them .
for example , brazil — this beautiful country hosting tedglobal has the world 's ugliest record .
and it 's not just brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs .
latin america has nine percent of the world 's population , but 25 percent of its global violent deaths .
across the americas , from the us and mexico to colombia and uruguay , change is in the air .
i call them lessons to change the world .
but this does n't mean that we should n't try .
until quite recently , we simply did n't know how many brazilians were killed by guns .
`` amazingly , it was a local soap opera called `` '' mulheres apaixonadas '' '' — or `` '' women in love '' '' — that kicked off brazil 's national gun control campaign . ''
in one highly viewed episode , a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet .
the televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion .
we gathered the victims , human rights champions , cultural icons .
each and every one of us has the power to change the world .
thank you .
( applause )
and to do that , they need a western education .
so we 're living in the age of the global plutocracy , but we 've been slow to notice it .
what 's driving it , and what can we do about it ?
we have superstar bankers .
again , this is no mere hypothetical .
we created public education .
we created unions .
we need a new new deal .
`` and they have a fight and an argument because — `` '' i want grapes . '' '' `` `` i want eneb . `` `` i want angur . '' '' — not knowing that the word that they 're using refers to the same reality in different languages . ''
now , i love penguin documentaries , but that was n't the news of the day .
nowadays , a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign .
now , to be clear , technology does empower in multiple ways .
it 's very powerful .
in egypt , i saw another four young people use digital connectivity to organize the supplies and logistics for 10 field hospitals , very large operations , during massive clashes near tahrir square in 2011 .
`` `` '' five minutes , '' '' he said . five minutes . ''
or think of the occupy movement which rocked the world in 2011 .
in embracing these technologies , are we overlooking some of the benefits of slow and sustained ?
i found that the gezi protesters were despairing .
today 's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base that can see them through the challenges .
so what 's the secret ?
he said the key is he never took sugar with his tea .
but his party won two major elections within a year of the gezi protests with comfortable margins .
we need movements to be more effective .
`` but then i stopped , because i figured , `` '' oh , you know , i made it . ''
i bought a fast car .
so they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
but it was n't a quick trip .
but in the end , business grew bigger than ever .
and we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees , just as it is for us , in relation to learning .
the earth is poisoning our foods .
so , there 's no time for more roots and shoots now .
all of these technologies we can use .
and just to think of one or two people out of africa who are just really inspiring .
in 2007 , i decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents .
so we could easily supply the world with dozens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
now this might sound preposterous to you if you 've never thought about new cities .
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
so i proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : charter cities .
they knew that about 75,000 hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in honduras .
`` at one point , javier said to octavio , `` '' what if we took some of our empty land — what if we just gave it to an embassy — give some to the u.s. embassy ; give some to the canadian embassy — and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada or under the rules of the united states , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the u.s. to do ? '' '' in the summer of 2009 , honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis . ''
at the next regularly scheduled election , pepe lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform , but reconciliation as well .
he asked octavio to be his chief of staff .
meanwhile , i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal .
through a process of refinement , trial and error , a lot of user testing , i tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you ca n't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it 's usually the rules that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk .
and i used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city : notice , land that 's worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
`` but it was a fairly abstract discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , octavio said , `` paul , maybe we could watch the tedtalk . '' ''
( laughing ) so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of honduras who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and talk again on january fourth and fifth .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
everybody applauded politely .
`` the leader of the congress came up on stage and said , `` '' professor romer , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could watch the tedtalk . ''
and it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly thereafter , on january 19th , they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions .
in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one .
all parties , all factions in society , backed this .
to be part of the constitution , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress .
on february 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one .
one is south korea .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the permits .
they 've actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third .
they 're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in , and also an external legal system .
there 's designers and builders of cities who are very interested .
they even can bring with them some financing .
but the one thing you know they 've already solved is that there 's lots of tenants .
there 's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there 's lots of people who 'd like to go there .
there 's a million a year who leave latin america to go to the united states .
sadly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they have n't seen , in some cases , for a decade .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in honduras ?
or to build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you , ted .
( applause )
i spent a week at sea on a research vessel .
now i 'm not a scientist , but i was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the university of south florida who have been tracking the travels of bp 's oil in the gulf of mexico .
the scientists i was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff — the birds , the turtles , the dolphins , the glamorous stuff .
so contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we did n't have to worry about it , this disaster is still unfolding .
it 's still working its way up the food chain .
and so , robin eggs failed to hatch , songbirds died en masse , towns fell silent .
`` thus the title `` '' silent spring . '' '' i 've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the gulf of mexico , because i 'm canadian , and i can draw no ancestral ties . ''
but even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed — the carelessness , the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up .
if there is one thing bp 's watery improv act made clear , it is that , as a culture , we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable , and to do so without a back-up plan , without an exit strategy .
our leaders barrel into wars , telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades .
then , it is years of deadly damage control , frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies , and once again , no exit strategy .
our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence , convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market — the kind that never goes down .
as with bp , the hole does get plugged , at least temporarily , but not before exacting a tremendous price .
we have to figure out why we keep letting this happen , because we are in the midst of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all — deciding what to do , or not to do , about climate change .
`` now as you know , a great deal of time is spent , in this country and around the world , inside the climate debate , on the question of , `` '' what if the ipc scientists are all wrong ? '' '' now a far more relevant question — as mit physicist evelyn fox keller puts it — is , `` '' what if those scientists are right ? '' '' given the stakes , the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle — the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible , we can not afford to wait ''
for perfect scientific certainty .
`` so rather than asking , as precaution would demand , what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe , we ask bizarre questions like this : `` '' what is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions ? ''
`` can we go with two degrees , three degrees , or — where we 're currently going — four degrees celsius ? '' '' and by the way , the assumption that we can safely control the earth 's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat , making the planet not too hot , not too cold , but just right — sort of goldilocks style — this is pure fantasy , and it 's not coming from the climate scientists . ''
it 's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science .
`` a range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now , like `` '' greed . '' '' this is a popular explanation , and there 's lots of truth to it , because taking big risks , as we all know , pays a lot of money . ''
for instance , if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon , then you need a narrative , you need a story that makes that disparity okay .
you 're either an incredibly good scammer , and you 're getting away with it — you gamed the system — or you 're some kind of boy genius , the likes of which the world has never seen .
putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you 're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a tedtalk , but personally , i think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of icarus hanging from the wall , because — maybe not that one in particular — but i want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time .
`` and this problem — call it the `` '' perils of privilege '' '' — brings us closer , i think , to the root of our collective recklessness . ''
because none of us — at least in the global north — neither men nor women , are fully exempt from this message .
and just when you think these stories are fading into history , and that we 've gotten over them , they pop up in the strangest places .
for instance , i stumbled across this advertisement outside the women 's washroom in the kansas city airport .
`` it 's for motorola 's new rugged cell phone , and yes , it really does say , `` slap mother nature in the face . '' ''
i 'm showing it because — they 're not a sponsor , are they ? — because , in its own way , this is a crass version of our founding story .
but this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature .
a new bubble will replace the old one .
in a way , that is the story of the settling of the americas , the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which europeans escaped .
now the problem is that the story was always a lie .
the earth always did have limits .
they were just beyond our sights .
and now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts .
i believe that we know this , yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop .
`` now on the one hand , exhorting us to `` '' drill , baby , drill , '' '' because god put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them , and on the other , glorying in the wilderness of alaska 's untouched beauty on her hit reality tv show . ''
ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall .
there are still no limits .
so stop worrying and keep shopping .
now , would that this were just about sarah palin and her reality tv show .
the truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era , the era of extreme energy .
so that means drilling for oil in the deepest water , including the icy arctic seas , where a clean-up may simply be impossible .
and most controversially , it means the tar sands .
i 'm always surprised by how little people outside of canada know about the alberta tar sands , which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the united states .
it 's worth taking a moment to understand this practice , because i believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we 're on like little else .
then , you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand .
the process requires a huge amount of water , which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds .
my point is that this is not oil drilling .
it 's not even mining .
it is terrestrial skinning .
vast , vivid landscapes are being gutted , left monochromatic gray .
but the truth is that , on average , turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in canada .
how else to describe this , but as a form of mass insanity ?
this is where our story of endless growth has taken us , to this black hole at the center of my country — a place of such planetary pain that , like the bp gusher , one can only stand to look at it for so long .
at the very last minute , we are going to get saved just like in every hollywood movie , just like in the rapture .
so , solving the problem of pollution with more pollution .
think of it as the ultimate junk shot .
they do n't know if they 'll work , and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash .
nevertheless , the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles , particularly media circles , with a relief tinged with euphoria .
an escape hatch has been reached .
a new frontier has been found .
most importantly , we do n't have to change our lifestyles after all .
we need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks — risks that confront recklessness head on , that put the precautionary principle into practice , even if that means through direct action — like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested , blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining . we need stories
that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around .
that this is our only home .
there is no escape hatch .
call it karma , call it physics , action and reaction , call it precaution — the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit .
i am a plant geneticist .
on his farm , he plants a variety of different crops .
you can see the large seeds .
now , today , breeders have even more options to choose from .
this papaya is infected with papaya ringspot virus .
this is kind of like a human getting a vaccination .
you can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center .
dennis ' pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry .
there 's no organic method . there 's no conventional method .
they 're able to harvest and replant for the next season .
chris anderson : powerfully argued .
one , complexity and unintended consequence .
it 's different in the less developed world .
even today 's sophisticated moviegoers still lose themselves to the screen , and filmmakers leverage this separation from reality to great effect .
playing with the world , and our perception of it , really is the essence of visual effects .
visual effects are based on the principles of all illusions : assumption , things are as we know them ; presumption , things will behave as we expect ; and context in reality , our knowledge of the world as we know it , such as scale .
now a fourth factor really becomes an obsession , which is , never betray the illusion .
and that last point has made visual effects a constant quest for perfection .
so from the hand-cranked jump cut early days of cinema to last sunday 's oscar winner , what follows are some steps and a few repeats in the evolution of visual effects .
second doctor : we 're gon na take this nice and easy , jake.first doctor : well , do you want to sit up ? that 's fine .
second doctor : and good , just take it nice and slow , jake .
well , no truncal ataxia , that 's good.first doctor : you feeling light-headed or dizzy at all ?
`` [ 'academy award for special effects - ( first year of category ) '' '' ] ( explosion ) [ `` '' '2012 ' ( 2009 ) '' '' ] governor : it seems to me that the worst is over . ''
so this is this gray structure in the center of the brain .
and if we give antidepressants , then we increase the production of these newborn neurons , and we decrease the symptoms of depression , establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression .
ok , let 's go .
increasing ?
yes .
learning will increase the production of these new neurons .
yes , stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus .
how about sleep deprivation ?
how about sex ?
however , it 's all about balance here .
and now , you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage .
so activity impacts neurogenesis , but that 's not all .
so here we have a sample of diet — of nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy .
so we think that the effect of diet on mental health , on memory and mood , is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus .
and it 's not only what you eat , but it 's also the texture of the food , when you eat it and how much of it you eat .
thank you .
do i have to run ?
or is it really just about aerobic exercise , getting oxygen to the brain ?
mh : so i do n't have to get a running wheel in my office ?
st : thank you , margaret .
so i do n't know , it started to become an interesting mix .
ss : well , on your way to the olympics , a couple of memorable events happened at georgetown .
like , i almost came out of it , in front of , like , 5,000 people .
`` because you know , the man is from brooklyn ; he 's a big man . he says , `` '' aimee , so what if your leg falls off ? ''
he kept me on the right track .
it 's now two years that you 've been running ?
so , here we are , a week after the olympics and down at atlanta , and i 'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago , i got out on a gravel track and could n't run 50 meters .
it 's my first international meet .
i wanted to find out times .
this is 20 minutes before my race in the olympic stadium , and they post the heat sheets . and i go over and look .
`` so they call us out and , you know — `` ladies , you have one minute . '' ''
`` and i had to think , `` '' why did i do this ? '' '' if i had won everything — but it was like , what was the point ? ''
i became a collegiate athlete , you know . i became an olympic athlete .
and it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there .
`` i mean , the fact that i set my sights , just a year and three months before , on becoming an olympic athlete and saying , `` '' here 's my life going in this direction — and i want to take it here for a while , and just seeing how far i could push it . '' '' and the fact that i asked for help — how many people jumped on board ? ''
and that was this collective glory — that there was , you know , 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to atlanta .
ss : you know , show us more than one set of legs .
and , seriously , like , i can wear heels .
these are — do you want to hold that actually ?
that 's another leg i have for , like , tennis and softball .
ss : are you a different height ?
am : in these ?
ss : she ca n't really stand on these legs . she has to be moving , so ...
but without having the silicon sock , i 'm just going to try slip in it .
and so , i run on these , and have shocked half the world on these .
but actually these , like i said , are still the actual prototype .
i mean , i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want — the shoes i want , the skirts i want — and i 'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people .
( laughter ) it is . it 's just stuck in this position , so i have to wear a two-inch heel .
i do n't know how good you can see it , but , like , it really is .
they do amazing stuff with silicon .
am : and this poses a problem for me , because it means i 'm walking like that all night long .
they got someone to come in and saw off the shoes .
`` i need a little bit off . '' '' they did n't even want to go there . ''
i want to get legs like these made for flat feet so i can wear sneakers , because i ca n't with these ones .
so ... moderator : that 's it .
( applause )
ms : ... meaning not so optimistic .
ms : these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
so i 'm really a basic scientist , not a clinician , but in the last year and a half i 've started to switch over , to use what we 've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices , and what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this .
and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina , diseases like macular degeneration , and there 's little that can be done for them .
so what i 'm going to tell you about today is a device that we 've been working on that i think has the potential to make a difference , to be much more effective , and what i wanted to do is show you how it works . okay , so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve .
here you have a retina .
so when you look at something , like this image of this baby 's face , it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina , on the front-end cells here , the photoreceptors .
and the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain , and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code . and when i say code , i do literally mean code .
`` like this pattern of pulses here actually means `` '' baby 's face , '' '' and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses , it knows that what was out there was a baby 's face , and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was , say , a dog , or another pattern would be a house . ''
anyway , you get the idea .
and , of course , in real life , it 's all dynamic , meaning that it 's changing all the time , so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you 're looking at is changing all the time too .
so , you know , it 's sort of a complicated thing . you have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you 're seeing .
so , a solution to the problem , then , would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front-end circuitry and send signals to the retina 's output cells , and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain .
and then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain , and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output .
so a completely blind retina , even one with no front-end circuitry at all , no photoreceptors , can now send out normal signals , signals that the brain can understand .
okay , so i just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it 's doing , because it 's really the key part and it 's sort of interesting and kind of cool .
in other words , we 're not literally replacing the components of the retina .
it 's not like we 're making a little mini-device for each of the different cell types .
we 've just abstracted what the retina 's doing with a set of equations .
now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output , and what the implications of this are .
so the bottom one is the state-of-the-art device that 's out there right now , which is basically made up of light detectors , but no encoder . so what we did was we presented movies of everyday things — people , babies , park benches , you know , regular things happening — and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals .
now just to orient you , each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells , and just as in the previous slides , each row is a different cell , and i just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so i could show you a long stretch of data .
so as you can see , the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder-transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns — and it 's not perfect , but it 's pretty good — and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic , the responses really do n't .
and so with the standard method , the cells do fire , they just do n't fire in the normal firing patterns because they do n't have the right code .
what 's the potential impact on a patient 's ability to see ?
so , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .
so what about with our approach , adding the code ? and you can see that it 's much better . not only can you tell that it 's a baby 's face , but you can tell that it 's this baby 's face , which is a really challenging task .
but the key one really is the encoder alone , because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer .
this is just actually the first one that we tried .
i just wanted to say something about the standard method .
when this first came out , it was just a really exciting thing , the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all .
now i just want to wrap up , and as i was mentioning earlier of course i have a lot of other data if you 're interested , but i just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language , and the potential power of being able to do that .
and then the last thing i wanted to say , really , is to emphasize that the idea generalizes .
so the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas , for example , the auditory system and the motor system , so for treating deafness and for motor disorders .
( applause )
in india , it is unfortunately only the women who carry water .
i do n't know if we indians can be proud of such a distinction .
so we are speaking about transformation , transformation in rural areas .
well in india , we have a theory , which is very much accepted by the government bureaucracy and all those who matter , that poor people deserve poor solutions and absolutely poor people deserve pathetic solutions .
so no water is stored . it 's always on tap .
this is how an elevated water reservoir is constructed .
and that is the end product .
so there were less than nine percent of girl children attending school , even if there was a school .
so this is a democracy in action because there is a general body , a governing board , the committee .
so i just want to tell you my story .
i spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace .
and naturally , i encounter a lot of resistance , because it 's considered to be anti-intellectual and counter to serious learning .
but i have a problem with that belief , because i know that doodling has a profound impact on the way that we can process information and the way that we can solve problems .
so i was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is .
in the 18th century , it became a verb , and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone .
no wonder people are averse to doodling at work .
( laughter ) additionally , i 've heard horror stories from people whose teachers scolded them , of course , for doodling in classrooms .
in the 1930s , freud told us all that you could analyze people 's psyches based on their doodles .
`` this is not accurate , but it did happen to tony blair at the davos forum in 2005 , when his doodles were , of course , `` '' discovered '' '' and he was labeled the following things . ''
( laughter ) and bill , if you 're here , nobody thinks you 're megalomaniacal .
but that does contribute to people not wanting to share their doodles .
i think that our culture is so intensely focused on verbal information that we 're almost blinded to the value of doodling .
and so because of that belief that i think needs to be burst , i 'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth .
and here 's the truth : doodling is an incredibly powerful tool , and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn .
so here 's a new definition for doodling .
and i hope there 's someone in here from the oxford english dictionary , because i want to talk to you later .
here 's the real definition : doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think .
here 's another interesting truth about the doodle : people who doodle when they 're exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non-doodling counterparts .
we think doodling is something you do when you lose focus , but in reality , it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus .
additionally , it has a profound effect on creative problem-solving and deep information processing .
there are four ways that learners intake information so that they can make decisions .
this is so nerdy , but this made me cry when i discovered this .
so they did anthropological research into the unfolding of artistic activity in children , and they found that , across space and time , all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic as they grow .
i think that means doodling is native to us and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct .
so here is my point : under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated from a classroom or a boardroom or even the war room .
and i will go you one further .
because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form , it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy .
thank you .
historically , one of those areas has been perception , the process by which things out there in the world — sounds and images — can turn into concepts in the mind .
the machine perception algorithms , for example , that our team makes , are what enable your pictures on google photos to become searchable , based on what 's in them .
the flip side of perception is creativity : turning a concept into something out there into the world .
i think michelangelo had a penetrating insight into to this dual relationship between perception and creativity .
the first person who , i think , really developed some kind of insight into what was going on in the brain was the great spanish neuroanatomist , santiago ramón y cajal , in the 19th century , who used microscopy and special stains that could selectively fill in or render in very high contrast the individual cells in the brain , in order to start to understand their morphologies .
this is from a bird brain .
the entire sample here is about one cubic millimeter in size , and i 'm showing you a very , very small piece of it here .
just for comparison 's sake , the diameter of an average strand of hair is about 100 microns .
so these are sort of in the same style as ramón y cajal .
warren mcculloch and walter pitts looked at ramón y cajal 's drawing of visual cortex , which i 'm showing here .
and i 'll show you what that actually looks like .
so the pixels you can think about as a first layer of neurons , and that 's , in fact , how it works in the eye — that 's the neurons in the retina .
there are billions or trillions of w 's , which represent the weights of all these synapses in the neural network .
and there 's a very small number of y 's , of outputs that that network has .
`` `` '' bird '' '' is only four letters , right ? ''
that 's one equation .
you know the neural network , you know the pixels .
you multiply two times three and you 're done .
i 'll show you an artificial neural network that we 've built recently , doing exactly that .
so in that picture , the x and the w are known , and the y is the unknown .
the problem is with this operator .
this is a very , very complicated , very non-linear operation ; it has no inverse .
and the way to do that is fairly straightforward .
so you 've taken an initial guess : what if w = 0 ?
and then the computer can sort of play marco polo , and drive down the error close to zero .
it 's exactly the same way that we do our own learning .
and about a year ago , alex mordvintsev , on our team , decided to experiment with what happens if we try solving for x , given a known w and a known y .
here he and alex together have tried reducing the y 's to a space of only two dimensions , thereby making a map out of the space of all things recognized by this network .
`` the animals are all here ; `` '' armadillo '' '' is right in that spot . ''
so you can see it 's not perfect .
here we 're starting with just a picture of clouds , and as we optimize , basically , this network is figuring out what it sees in the clouds .
and the more time you spend looking at this , the more things you also will see in the clouds .
you could also use the face network to hallucinate into this , and you get some pretty crazy stuff .
( laughter ) or , mike has done some other experiments in which he takes that cloud image , hallucinates , zooms , hallucinates , zooms hallucinates , zooms .
also , i think that perception and creativity are by no means uniquely human .
and we finally are starting to fulfill now some of the promises of those early pioneers , of turing and von neumann and mcculloch and pitts .
she 's worried .
i was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be .
but i also felt more alive than i 've ever done since .
and i found myself sort of scratching at the walls of life , as if i was trying to find a way out into a wider space beyond .
we 've privileged safety over experience and we 've gained a lot in doing so , but i think we 've lost something too .
now , i do n't romanticize evolutionary time .
i just wanted a richer and rawer life than i 've been able to lead in britain , or , indeed , that we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world .
`` the word is `` '' rewilding , '' '' and even though rewilding is a young word , it already has several definitions . ''
the first one is the mass restoration of ecosystems .
now , we all know that wolves kill various species of animals , but perhaps we 're slightly less aware that they give life to many others .
it sounds strange , but just follow me for a while .
the numbers of deer , because there was nothing to hunt them , had built up and built up in the yellowstone park , and despite efforts by humans to control them , they 'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there to almost nothing , they 'd just grazed it away .
the deer started avoiding certain parts of the park , the places where they could be trapped most easily , particularly the valleys and the gorges , and immediately those places started to regenerate .
and the dams they built in the rivers provided habitats for otters and muskrats and ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians .
bears fed on it too , and their population began to rise as well , partly also because there were more berries growing on the regenerating shrubs , and the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves by killing some of the calves of the deer .
but here 's where it gets really interesting .
there was less erosion . the channels narrowed .
more pools formed , more riffle sections , all of which were great for wildlife habitats .
the rivers changed in response to the wolves , and the reason was that the regenerating forests stabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often , so that the rivers became more fixed in their course .
similarly , by driving the deer out of some places and the vegetation recovering on the valley sides , there was less soil erosion , because the vegetation stabilized that as well .
so the wolves , small in number , transformed not just the ecosystem of the yellowstone national park , this huge area of land , but also its physical geography .
whales in the southern oceans have similarly wide-ranging effects .
but the opposite happened .
you take the whales away , and the number of krill collapses .
why would that possibly have happened ?
the other thing that whales do is that , as they 're plunging up and down through the water column , they 're kicking the phytoplankton back up towards the surface where it can continue to survive and reproduce .
well , it seems that when whales were at their historic populations , they were probably responsible for sequestering some tens of millions of tons of carbon every year from the atmosphere .
and when you look at it like that , you think , wait a minute , here are the wolves changing the physical geography of the yellowstone national park .
they tell us that when you take away the large animals , you are left with a radically different ecosystem to one which retains its large animals .
and they make , in my view , a powerful case for the reintroduction of missing species .
it means taking down the fences , it means blocking the drainage ditches , it means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea , but otherwise stepping back .
it does n't try to produce a heath or a meadow or a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef .
it lets nature decide , and nature , by and large , is pretty good at deciding .
the other one is the rewilding of human life .
and i do n't see this as an alternative to civilization .
and the opportunities for this are developing more rapidly than you might think possible .
there 's another one which suggests that 30 million hectares of land in europe , an area the size of poland , will be vacated by farmers between 2000 and 2030 .
well , every continent had one , apart from antarctica .
when trafalgar square in london was excavated , the river gravels there were found to be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus , rhinos , elephants , hyenas , lions .
it 's not climate , largely , which has got rid of the world 's megafaunas .
why is it that so many deciduous trees are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken ?
why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark ?
it was a lot bigger than the asian elephant .
and perhaps this is the most important thing that rewilding offers us , the most important thing that 's missing from our lives : hope .
the story rewilding tells us is that ecological change need not always proceed in one direction .
it offers us the hope that our silent spring could be replaced by a raucous summer .
( applause )
and when you go into the supermarket , you certainly do n't see a lot of choices there .
but there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans .
the bad news is they 're extinct .
and there are a couple of answers to that question .
it 's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane .
it 's a remarkably beautiful landscape . i ca n't even begin to describe it to you .
it 's otherworldly , beautiful .
about a year from now , we 'll have over half a million samples .
because , quite literally , if agriculture does n't adapt to climate change , neither will we .
( applause )
giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
`` without hesitation , little dorothy responded , `` yes , daddy , and fish swim backwards by wagging their heads . '' ''
( laughter ) in her mind , it was a fact as true as any other .
we make assumptions and faulty leaps of logic .
we know that we are right , and they are wrong .
we tell ourselves what we can and can not do .
in our minds , fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads and we do n't even notice them .
i 'm going to tell you five facts about myself .
three : i starred on a television sitcom .
five : i served as a law clerk to two us supreme court justices .
which fact is not true ?
actually , they 're all true .
( applause ) at this point , most people really only care about the television show .
why is that ?
we make assumptions about so-called disabilities .
my point today is not about my blindness , however .
it 's about my vision .
going blind cast them into focus .
it 's immediate and passive .
right ?
objects appeared , morphed and disappeared in my reality .
i pieced together fragmented , transitory images , consciously analyzed the clues , searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope , until i saw nothing at all .
i learned that what we see is not universal truth .
it is not objective reality .
what we see is a unique , personal , virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain .
let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience .
that 's compared to approximately eight percent for touch and two to three percent for hearing .
it 's no surprise then that the illusion of sight is so compelling .
but make no mistake about it : sight is an illusion .
here 's where it gets interesting .
to create the experience of sight , your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world , other knowledge , your memories , opinions , emotions , mental attention .
all of these things and far more are linked in your brain to your sight .
so for example , what you see impacts how you feel , and the way you feel can literally change what you see .
you create your own reality , and you believe it .
i believed mine until it broke apart .
we create our own realities in many other ways .
under the warped logic of fear , anything is better than the uncertain .
fear replaces the unknown with the awful .
when you face a compelling opportunity to take action , fear lulls you into inaction , enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves .
blindness was a death sentence for my independence .
i knew it .
i am certain of that .
it is a learned discipline .
it can be taught . it can be practiced .
i will summarize very briefly .
see beyond your fears .
correct your misconceptions about luck and about success .
accept your strengths and your weaknesses , and understand the difference .
you are the creator of your reality .
i chose to build there a blessed life .
what lies do you tell yourself ?
how do you embellish your truth and write your own fictions ?
what reality are you creating for yourself ?
helen keller said that the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision .
thank you .
what kind of specific challenges do you have , and how do you overcome them ?
isaac lidsky : well , the biggest challenge became a blessing .
( laughter ) bg : what 's that noise there ? il : yeah .
i basically force people to tell me what they think .
and in this respect , it 's become , like i said , a real blessing for me personally and for my company , because we communicate at a far deeper level , we avoid ambiguities , and most important , my team knows that what they think truly matters .
i 'd take naps every chance i got because it was really hard work .
so what 's going on here ?
see cool , smoke to be cool , feel good . repeat .
but added a twist ?
i 'll give you an example .
and this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity , which is naturally rewarding .
and what happens when we get curious ?
now , one current hypothesis is that a region of this network , called the posterior cingulate cortex , is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it , when we get sucked in , and it takes us for a ride .
now , remember that bit about context-dependent memory ?
i do n't know if you 've noticed , but there 's been a spate of books that have come out lately contemplating or speculating on the cognition and emotional life of dogs .
`` the first dog is the first to go , and he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner , and the title is `` '' a dog on his master . '' '' `` `` as young as i look , i am growing older faster than he . ''
seven to one is the ratio , they tend to say .
and our next dog speaks in something called the revenant , which means a spirit that comes back to visit you .
i admit the sight of the leash would excite me , but only because it meant i was about to smell things you had never touched .
the jingling of my tags drove me mad .
`` now , i am free of the collar , free of the yellow raincoat , monogrammed sweater , the absurdity of your lawn , and that is all you need to know about this place , except what you already supposed and are glad it did not happen sooner , that everyone here can read and write , the dogs in poetry , the cats and all the others in prose . '' '' thank you . ''
`` we 'll sign the contract and you 'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away . '' '' so i was excited . ''
nor did i get any responses from the other people that they gave me on the list where i could get apartments .
his name was mcdow , major mcdow .
if you noticed , in mountain home , there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place .
i went to one after another , after another .
it did n't have any paved roads in it , it did n't have the concrete slabs , it did n't have fencing to portion off your trailer slot from other trailer slots .
it did n't have a laundry facility .
but the conclusion i reached at that moment was that i did n't have a lot of other options .
`` so i called my wife , and i said , `` '' we 're going to make this one work . '' '' and we moved into it and we became homeowners in mountain home , idaho . ''
and of course , eventually things settled down .
that was n't a problem because we had just purchased a brand-new automobile .
the light came back on .
so we 're just trying to get him to stay in school .
we have to challenge that . it does n't make any sense .
`` as essential as it is across our traditions , as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives , the word `` '' compassion '' '' is hollowed out in our culture , and it is suspect in my field of journalism . ''
`` karen armstrong has told what i think is an iconic story of giving a speech in holland and , after the fact , the word `` '' compassion '' '' was translated as `` '' pity . '' '' now compassion , when it enters the news , too often comes in the form of feel-good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self-sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time . ''
when this country first encountered genuine diversity in the 1960s , we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that .
and it 's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough .
i think that without perhaps being able to name it , we are collectively experiencing that we 've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue .
it is organic , across our religious , spiritual and ethical traditions , and yet it transcends them .
compassion is also curious .
compassion cultivates and practices curiosity .
i love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in los angeles , aziza hasan and malka fenyvesi .
and in that light , for the religious , compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery — encouraging us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering , in the face of a stranger , in the face of the vibrant religious other .
and compassion does seek physicality .
he 's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13 , in a car crash that killed his father and his sister .
he 's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from iraq and afghanistan .
`` `` '' tender '' '' is another word i would love to spend some time resurrecting . ''
we spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive , and i spend a lot of time being those things too .
and compassion can also have those qualities .
he 's says that what they do with l'arche is not a solution , but a sign .
we need those things too , but we 're also bumping up against their limits .
and at the same time that we are doing that , i think we are rediscovering the power of story — that as human beings , we need stories to survive , to flourish , to change .
and i 'll never forget hearing that story from dr. rachel naomi remen , who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her , that in the beginning of the creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces .
and that the highest human calling is to look for this light , to point at it when we see it , to gather it up , and in so doing , to repair the world .
some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way .
rachel naomi remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors .
this is going to change science , i believe , and it will change religion .
we do n't hear so much about the einstein who invited the african american opera singer , marian anderson , to stay in his home when she came to sing in princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and would n't have her .
we do n't hear about the einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in europe or the scottsboro boys in the american south .
einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions .
he once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three-year-old .
and einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced , we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more , not less .
some of his favorites were moses , jesus , buddha , st. francis of assisi , gandhi — he adored his contemporary , gandhi .
so in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral — it 's not .
this is the full photograph , and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket , smoking a cigar .
but what a liberating thing to realize that our problems , in fact , are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion , towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others .
rachel naomi remen is a better doctor because of her life-long struggle with crohn 's disease .
and karen armstrong , i think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that , with a zigzag , have led to the charter for compassion .
compassion ca n't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity .
so i want to propose a final definition of compassion — this is einstein with paul robeson by the way — and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology .
but compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious .
so i will paraphrase einstein in closing and say that humanity , the future of humanity , needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race .
my grandfather was a coal miner .
so for the climate , history may judge that the banking crisis happened at just the wrong time .
and boy , did they print .
`` in both cases , `` '' whatever it takes '' '' meant trillions of dollars more in money-printing policies that continue today . ''
so those extra reserves that were printed in 2009 , in the end , for developed market countries at least , were n't really needed .
and they remain unused today .
it could also — it could also serve as a test case .
printing international money in this way has several advantages over printing national currencies .
the real question is : do we care enough about future generations to take the very same policy risks we took to save the financial system ?
i 'd like to talk about what i call our warehouses for hope .
sami osmakac is n't alone .
i 'd never really memorialized myself .
that 's largely true .
actually , i love sports and i can play many sports , like swimming , skiing , skating , scuba diving , running and so on .
but there is one limitation : somebody needs to help me .
i lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident .
for example , one of my challenges was textbooks .
and that animated graphics can make a difference .
so three things have happened .
and i will talk on , is this possible ?
because this is where we are .
and this was 2007 .
so this is what happens in the world , if we play the entire world .
and behind the health is the educational level .
we have to look over generations to understand it .
and this is my family .
i 'm the mexican in the family .
this is 1962 , and united states was emitting 16 tons per person .
from now on we count per capita .
this is two to five dollars . you have a bed .
but you can do that .
what is this , what is this , what am i telling ?
and going to school , that 's not a goal , it 's a mean .
even african countries can achieve this .
and it 's all solid steel — you can hear here .
we had been collecting data for six years .
well , think about when a bird sits on her eggs .
why is she sitting on them ?
here 's a chart that we had about three or four years ago .
and the whole time i 'm driving and i 'm thinking , you ca n't die on me now .
so donald goes into this slew of medications he was taking .
i challenge you to take ownership of your data .
hands up .
but you know what ? you do n't have to take my word for it .
the first is nick rhoades . he 's an american .
the nurse announced that every pregnant woman must also be tested for hiv that day .
according to those same estimates , in 2010 1.8 million people died of aids related causes .
and as activists , we would take our polaroid camera , we would take her picture , we would wait 90 seconds , and we would give her the photograph .
we were making what was invisible visible .
between 1993 and 2010 , domestic violence among adult women in the united states has gone down by 64 percent , and that is great news .
( applause ) sixty-four percent . now , how did we get there ?
thirty years ago , women were beaten , they were stalked , they were raped , and no one talked about it .
and so step one on this journey is we organized , and we created this extraordinary underground network of amazing women who opened shelters , and if they did n't open a shelter , they opened their home so that women and children could be safe .
and i remember walking through the halls of the u.s. capitol , and i was in my 30s , and my life had purpose , and i could n't imagine that anybody would ever challenge this important piece of legislation .
but i heard about a congressman who had a very , very different point of view .
he called it the take the fun out of marriage act .
the take the fun out of marriage act .
( laughter ) ten years later , after lots of hard work , we finally passed the violence against women act , which is a life-changing act that has saved so many lives . ( applause ) thank you .
i was proud to be part of that work , and it changed the laws and it put millions of dollars into local communities .
and i have to tell you , i 'm passionate about data .
in fact , i am a data nerd .
i 'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here .
and i also want to say one other thing : we are not going to solve this problem by building more jails or by even building more shelters .
it is about economic empowerment for women , it is about healing kids who are hurt , and it is about prevention with a capital p .
and we looked around the world to canada and australia and brazil and parts of africa , and we took this knowledge and we built the first national public education campaign called there 's no excuse for domestic violence .
please don't—let go of me !
man : you want to see what hurts ? ( slaps woman ) that 's what hurts ! that 's what hurts ! ( breaking glass ) woman : help me !
`` [ `` '' children have to sit by and watch . what 's your excuse ? '' '' ] esta soler : as we were in the process of releasing this campaign , o.j . simpson was arrested for the murder of his wife and her friend . ''
our ads blanketed the airwaves , and women , for the first time , started to tell their stories .
movements are about moments , and we seized this moment .
and let me just put this in context .
i 'll tell you : 158 .
and in the 2000s , over 7,000 .
so , step four : we needed to engage men .
we could n't solve this problem with 50 percent of the population on the sidelines .
national polling told us that men felt indicted and not invited into this conversation .
so we wondered , how can we include men ?
`` but he said , `` '' do you know what they do do ? ''
and then we had this one event that stays in my heart forever where a basketball coach was talking to a room filled with male athletes and men from all walks of life .
and he was talking about the importance of coaching boys into men and changing the culture of the locker room and giving men the tools to have healthy relationships .
`` he gave her this big hug , and he said , `` '' people ask me why i do this work . ''
`` i do this work because i 'm her dad , and i do n't want anyone ever to hurt her . '' '' and as a parent , i get it . ''
we 've done a lot for adult women .
we just do . we have to . ( applause ) we 've come a long way since the days of the polaroid .
technology has been our friend .
( applause ) i 'm the daughter of a man who joined one club in his life , the optimist club .
and it is his spirit and his optimism that is in my dna .
i have been doing this work for over 30 years , and i am convinced , now more than ever , in the capacity of human beings to change .
some mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth .
i wanted to help .
but i did n't know how .
something had gone wrong with the lion tamer .
it was bull walker .
the strongman had given the lion tamer mouth-to-mouth , and saved his life .
his medical colleagues did n't know his secret , either .
he was a wrestler ; he was a doctor .
he was a heel ; he was a hero .
but that all happened later .
his internship at new york 's st. vincent 's hospital paid nothing .
he said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head .
next , he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital .
she heaved and pushed , clearly in anguish .
at that moment , he decided to devote his life to anesthesiology .
at 7,700 beds , it was one of the largest army hospitals in america .
bonica was in charge of all pain control there .
he was only 27 .
but if the injury had been treated , why would the alarm bell keep ringing ?
there were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever , and yet , still the patient hurt .
and he tried to get their opinions on his patients .
it took too long , so he started organizing group meetings over lunch .
`` the most important thing from the patient 's perspective , they do n't talk about . '' '' so over the next eight years , bonica would talk about it . ''
but the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine .
he recast the very purpose of medicine .
the goal was n't to make patients better ; it was to make patients feel better .
hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world .
bonica 's years of wrestling caught up to him .
still in his mid-50s , he suffered severe osteoarthritis .
over the next 20 years he 'd have 22 surgeries , including four spine operations , and hip replacement after hip replacement .
his friends and former students became his doctors .
the house belonged to the zacchini family , who were something like american circus royalty .
but still , i love imagining it .
he felt it . he lived it .
in that same oral history , bonica claimed that pain is the most complex human experience .
that it involves your past life , your current life , your interactions , your family .
but it was also true for my mom .
sometimes i get stuck seeing her that same way .
but as i saw bonica 's pain — a testament to his fully lived life — i started to remember all the things that my mom 's pain holds .
when i was a kid , they cut my hair , wiped my nose , tied my shoes .
it 's a story about this woman , natalia rybczynski .
but in this case , the arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it .
and he found a match .
a camel .
so how on earth would one of these guys end up in the high arctic ?
like a boomerang , the thing i loved came back to me .
i gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise .
one day , before i realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees , i fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body .
we are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway , and if in some way we are , do n't worry .
it was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents .
so this process is something that i study and it 's called atmospheric escape .
and you would say , well , there are eight planets , maybe nine .
and that 's fundamentally driving atmospheric escape .
no ocean , no life support system .
so over the long course of human history , the infectious disease that 's killed more humans than any other is malaria .
we may have had malaria since we evolved from the apes .
and to this day , malaria takes a huge toll on our species .
now this really makes no sense .
we 've known how to cure malaria since the 1600s .
we 've known how to prevent malaria since 1897 .
that 's when the british army surgeon ronald ross discovered that it was mosquitos that carried malaria , not bad air or miasmas , as was previously thought .
i grew up as the daughter of indian immigrants visiting my cousins in india every summer , and because i had no immunity to the local malarias , i was made to sleep under this hot , sweaty mosquito net every night while my cousins , they were allowed to sleep out on the terrace and have this nice , cool night breeze wafting over them .
we 're not supposed to walk on grass , because you could , you know , inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass .
we 're certainly not supposed to swat mosquitos .
and i think there 's three main reasons why .
this little parasite that causes malaria , it 's probably one of the most complex and wily pathogens known to humankind .
it has spread . it has more ways to evade attack than we know .
it 's a shape-shifter , for one thing .
and each of those life stages not only looks totally different from each other , they have totally different physiology .
it might do nothing at all to any of the other stages .
only about 12 species of mosquitos carry most of the world 's malaria , and we know quite a bit about the kinds of watery habitats that they specialize in .
so you might think , then , well , why do n't we just avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live ? right ?
we could avoid the places where the killer grizzly bears live and we avoid the places where the killer crocodiles live .
or say your cow does , or say your pig does , and then , say , it rains , and that footprint fills up with a little bit of water .
so it 's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects .
we kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives .
malaria occurs in some of the poorest and most remote places on earth , and there 's a reason for that .
if you 're poor , you 're more likely to get malaria .
these are places where mosquitos breed .
you 're less likely to have door screens or window screens .
you 're getting bitten by mosquitos more .
so poverty causes malaria , but what we also know now is that malaria itself causes poverty .
for one thing , it strikes hardest during harvest season , so exactly when farmers need to be out in the fields collecting their crops , they 're home sick with a fever .
but it also predisposes people to death from all other causes .
so this has happened historically .
and the economist jeff sachs has actually quantified what this means for a society .
and it 's the paradox that the people who have the most malaria in the world tend to care about it the least .
this has been the finding of medical anthropologists again and again .
and it 's simple risk perception , really .
a child in malawi , for example , she might have 12 episodes of malaria before the age of two , but if she survives , she 'll continue to get malaria throughout her life , but she 's much less likely to die of it .
and so in her lived experience , malaria is something that comes and goes .
and that 's actually true for most of the world 's malaria .
it 's just , there 's so much malaria that this tiny fraction of cases that end in death add up to this big , huge number .
and so this poses a huge cultural challenge in taming malaria , because if people think it 's normal to have malaria , then how do you get them to run to the doctor to get diagnosed , to pick up their prescription , to get it filled , to take the drugs , to put on the repellents , to tuck in the bed nets ?
so take all that together .
and that adds up to the biggest problem of all , which , of course , is the political problem .
how do you get a political leader to do anything about a problem like this ?
most malarious societies throughout history have simply lived with the disease .
so the main attacks on malaria have come from outside of malarious societies , from people who are n't constrained by these rather paralyzing politics .
but this , i think , introduces a whole host of other kinds of difficulties .
it was the brainchild of the u.s. state department .
and this effort well understood the economic challenge .
they knew they had to focus on cheap , easy-to-use tools , and they focused on ddt .
in fact , their rather patronizing view was that people at risk of malaria should n't be asked to do anything at all .
the whole campaign crashed , malaria resurged back , but now it was even worse than before because it was corralled into the hardest-to-reach places in the most difficult-to-control forms .
it 's similarly directed and financed primarily from outside of malarious societies .
now this effort well understands the scientific challenge .
and they understand the economic challenge too .
but now , i think , the dilemma is the cultural challenge .
the centerpiece of the current effort is the bed net .
it 's treated with insecticides .
this thing has been distributed across the malarious world by the millions .
so for them , the calculus must be quite different .
`` imagine , for example , if a bunch of well-meaning kenyans came up to those of us in the temperate world and said , `` '' you know , you people have a lot of cold and flu . ''
`` it 's called a face mask , and all you need to do is wear it every day during cold and flu season when you go to school and when you go to work . '' '' would we do that ? ''
and i wonder if that 's how people in the malarious world thought of those nets when they first received them ?
so it 's probably an overestimate .
we can do more education , we can try to convince these people to use the nets .
and that 's what happening now .
we 're throwing a lot more time and money into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays and school meetings , all these things to convince people to use the nets we gave you .
and that might work .
but it takes time . it takes money .
so it 's difficult to attack malaria from inside malarious societies , but it 's equally tricky when we try to attack it from outside of those societies .
that 's not to say that malaria is unconquerable , because i think it is , but what if we attacked this disease according to the priorities of the people who lived with it ?
we had malaria in those countries for hundreds of years , and we got rid of it completely , not because we attacked malaria . we did n't .
we attacked bad roads and bad houses and bad drainage and lack of electricity and rural poverty .
we attacked the malarious way of life , and by doing that , we slowly built malaria out .
and attacking the malarious way of life , it 's not fast , it 's not cheap , it 's not easy , but i think it 's the only lasting way forward .
thank you so much .
( applause )
we have drugs and vaccines .
it 's kind of unbelievable .
we should do something about that .
we tested it a lot , but it could still fail .
`` in fact , we had a porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day , `` this is completely stupid . what are we thinking ? '' ''
the better the technology gets , the less reliable the driver is going to get .
and the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes when it 's supposed to to help you avoid an accident .
there are now 17,000 less people dying every year in america .
that 's like comparing how fast i run to the speed of light .
it does n't matter how hard i train , i 'm never actually going to get there .
let 's spend some time talking about how the car sees the world .
knowing that one pickup truck is great , but we really need to know what everybody 's thinking , so it becomes quite a complicated problem .
and when a police officer stood in the road , our vehicle should understand that this means stop , and when they signal to go , we should continue .
here there 's a cyclist coming down the road and we know they 're going to continue to drive down the shape of the road .
and now , watch the left as the car with the green box decides he needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment .
and of course , the vehicle responds safely .
i believe that the greatest failure of the human race is the fact that we 've left more than one billion of our members behind .
what is extreme poverty ?
in the morning , however , there was nothing to eat .
children need food not only to survive but also to grow physically and mentally .
these children matter .
this girl matters .
but remember our friend archimedes .
global poverty has powerful levers .
lever number one : most of the world 's poor are farmers .
if this picture represents the world 's poor , then more than half engage in farming as a major source of income .
this gets me really excited .
all of these people , one profession .
think how powerful this is .
farmers are basically a really important leverage point .
when farmers become more productive , they earn more income , they climb out of poverty , they feed their communities and they reduce environmental land pressure .
and not a farmer like this one , but rather this lady .
currently , they take a little bit of saved food grain from the prior year , they plant it in the ground and they till it with a manual hand hoe .
next , conventional fertilizer , if used responsibly , is environmentally sustainable .
we do n't need more genius types right now .
so these are the three levers , and the most powerful lever is simply delivery .
i want to share the concrete example that i know best , my organization , one acre fund .
they then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms .
and then we surround all that with training .
look at the pride on her face .
today , i 'm proud to say that we 're serving about 400,000 farmers like consolata .
let me show you how possible this is .
i chose sub-saharan africa because this is a huge delivery territory .
if america can deliver pizza to an area of this size , then africa 's companies , governments and non-profits can deliver farm services to all of her farmers .
this is possible .
i 'm going to wrap up by generalizing beyond just farming .
urban poverty is even more concentrated , in these green little dots .
we just lack the will .
if we are willing , every one of us has a role to play .
but we also need a lot of support roles .
and no matter how logistically possible it is to end poverty , we need a lot more resources .
if you 're interested in these ideas , check out this website .
but we 've left more than one billion of our members behind .
logistically speaking , it 's incredibly possible to end extreme poverty .
thank you .
of course they must be more energy-efficient .
and we really , we really loved this machine .
what is going to be the future of learning ?
i do have a plan , but in order for me to tell you what that plan is , i need to tell you a little story , which kind of sets the stage .
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?
and you can look far back into the past , but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is , it 's quite easy to figure out where it came from .
`` it came from about 300 years ago , and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet . [ `` '' the british empire '' '' ] imagine trying to run the show , trying to run the entire planet , without computers , without telephones , with data handwritten on pieces of paper , and traveling by ships . ''
they created a global computer made up of people .
it 's still with us today .
the schools would produce the people who would then become parts of the bureaucratic administrative machine .
they engineered a system that was so robust that it 's still with us today , continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists .
the empire is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?
what are the kind of jobs that we have today ?
they 're there in thousands in every office .
they do need to be able to read .
in fact , they need to be able to read discerningly .
well , that 's today , but we do n't even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like .
and right next to where i used to work , there was a slum .
and i used to think , how on earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ?
`` at the same time , we also had lots of parents , rich people , who had computers , and who used to tell me , `` '' you know , my son , i think he 's gifted , because he does wonderful things with computers . ''
( laughter ) what did the poor do wrong ?
about eight hours later , we found them browsing and teaching each other how to browse .
to his left is his student . she 's six .
then onto other parts of the country , i repeated this over and over again , getting exactly the same results that we were .
i 'd seen it happen over and over and over again .
i started experimenting with other subjects , among them , for example , pronunciation .
i decided i would destroy my own argument by creating an absurd proposition .
i found a village . it was called kallikuppam in southern india .
they 'd got a zero . i gave them a test .
i got an educational impossibility , zero to 30 percent in two months in the tropical heat with a computer under the tree in a language they did n't know doing something that 's a decade ahead of their time .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
thirty percent is a fail .
how do i get them to pass ? i have to get them 20 more marks .
when i saw that graph i knew there is a way to level the playing field .
( children speaking ) neurons ... communication .
i got the camera angle wrong . that one is just amateur stuff , but what she was saying , as you could make out , was about neurons , with her hands were like that , and she was saying neurons communicate .
so what are jobs going to be like ?
well , we know what they 're like today .
what 's learning going to be like ? we know what it 's like today , children pouring over with their mobile phones on the one hand and then reluctantly going to school to pick up their books with their other hand .
what will it be tomorrow ?
could it be that , at the point in time when you need to know something , you can find out in two minutes ?
but that 's terrible . we are homo sapiens .
but look at it this way .
it took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become homo sapiens .
encouragement seems to be the key .
`` if you look at kuppam , if you look at all of the experiments that i did , it was simply saying , `` '' wow , '' '' saluting learning . ''
there is evidence from neuroscience .
punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
`` we take our children , we make them shut their brains down , and then we say , `` '' perform . '' '' why did they create a system like that ? ''
because it was needed .
when you 're standing in a trench all alone , if you could have survived , you 're okay , you 've passed .
what happens to creativity in our age ?
i came back to england looking for british grandmothers .
i put out notices in papers saying , if you are a british grandmother , if you have broadband and a web camera , can you give me one hour of your time per week for free ?
she does it with only one age-old gesture .
`` `` shhh . '' ''
watch this .
if you allow the educational process to self-organize , then learning emerges .
the teacher sets the process in motion and then she stands back in awe and watches as learning happens .
well , i intend to build these self-organized learning environments .
( children talking ) this one is in england .
he maintains law and order , because remember , there 's no teacher around .
the net charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons .
sm : a decade ahead of her time .
so soles , i think we need a curriculum of big questions .
you already heard about that . you know what that means .
they built the first curriculum , but we 've lost sight of those wondrous questions .
`` i 've tried incredible , incredible questions — `` '' when did the world begin ? how will it end ? '' '' — to nine-year-olds . ''
this one is about what happens to the air we breathe .
this is done by children without the help of any teacher .
the teacher only raises the question , and then stands back and admires the answer .
so what 's my wish ?
my wish is that we design the future of learning .
we do n't want to be spare parts for a great human computer , do we ?
and i 've got to — hang on , i 've got to get this wording exactly right , because , you know , it 's very important .
it will be called the school in the cloud .
it will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in .
the way i want to do this is to build a facility where i can study this .
it 's a facility which is practically unmanned .
there 's only one granny who manages health and safety .
that 's my wish .
and just one last thing .
at 12,000 feet , where the air is thin , i once built two hole in the wall computers , and the children flocked there .
( laughter ) ( applause ) i think it was good advice .
and i was distraught .
and of course , everything in africa grew beautifully .
`` that 's why the white people in africa are called `` '' bwana , '' '' boss . ''
the most important thing is passion .
the internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
the context matters .
you are also concerned about the degradation of the environment .
and even this , however , is a very simplistic dichotomy .
of course , in this system governments do tax , and they use part of their revenues to fund social programs , recognizing that government 's role is not just regulation but also to be arbiter of social goods .
i would argue that there are two sides to this challenge .
first of all , we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism .
for example , sending children to school , parents could earn money for that , or getting their children inoculated or immunized , parents could get paid for doing that .
but there are also benefits and significant changes underway on left-leaning policies .
but also we 've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs .
things like the corporate social responsibility programs , albeit small in scale , are moving in that right direction .
of course , left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government , ngos and private sector .
more recently , of course , the advent of the internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society .
my fundamental message to you is this : we can not continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological .
in order to create sustainable , long-term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today , we 're going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work .
ultimately , we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth .
is that what you 're suggesting ?
do n't think they are making small talk .
maybe you do n't believe in the chinese zodiac .
as a quarter of the world population is influenced by it , you 'd be wise to do something about that .
so what is the chinese zodiac , exactly ?
the chinese zodiac is different .
for example , if you were born in 1975 , you are a rabbit .
our chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework based on yin and yang , the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals .
the chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others .
we even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations .
as a pig , i need to be careful with a snake .
raise your hand if you are a snake .
let 's have a chat later .
jack ma 's parents must have been very proud .
and they are not the only ones .
that means another one million more babies .
why ?
i went through the forbes top 300 richest people in the world , and it 's interesting to see the most undesirable two animals , the goat and tiger , are at the top of the chart , even higher than the dragon .
as china plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics , the decisions made based on the zodiac and other chinese traditions end up impacting everyone around the world .
2016 is the year of the monkey .
thank you .
you may not realize this , but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy .
and like writing software , we can print and write dna into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria .
the growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair .
altogether , imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer , or even other diseases .
let me tell you , it has been a fantastic month for deception .
it 's been fantastic .
much of the deception is everyday . in fact , a lot of research shows that we all lie once or twice a day , as dave suggested .
so it 's about 6:30 now , suggests that most of us should have lied .
all right , good . these are all the liars .
make sure you pay attention to them . ( laughter ) no , that looked good , it was about two thirds of you .
the other third did n't lie , or perhaps forgot , or you 're lying to me about your lying , which is very , very devious . ( laughter ) this fits with a lot of the research , which suggests that lying is very pervasive .
here we have diogenes with his lantern .
does anybody know what he was looking for ?
a single honest man , and he died without finding one back in greece . and we have confucius in the east who was really concerned with sincerity , not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk , but that you believed in what you were doing .
you believed in your principles .
i was a customs officer for canada back in the mid-'90s .
but even since just 1995 , '96 , the way we communicate has been completely transformed . we email , we text , we skype , we facebook . it 's insane .
they 're called the butler , the sock puppet and the chinese water army .
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but actually they 're all new types of lies .
`` let 's start with the butlers . here 's an example of one : `` on my way . '' anybody ever written , `` on my way ? '' ''
`` here 's another one : `` '' sorry i did n't respond to you earlier . ''
`` my battery was dead . '' '' your battery was n't dead . ''
you were n't in a dead zone .
`` here 's the last one : you 're talking to somebody , and you say , `` '' sorry , got work , got ta go . '' '' but really , you 're just bored . you want to talk to somebody else . ''
our relationship is still important .
here 's a reviewer online , on amazon .
`` my favorite , by nicodemus jones , is , `` whatever else it might do , it will touch your soul . '' ''
and of course , you might suspect that nicodemus jones is r.j. ellory .
walt whitman also did this back in the day , before there was internet technology . sock puppet becomes interesting when we get to scale , which is the domain of the chinese water army .
we see this especially with product reviews , book reviews , everything from hotels to whether that toaster is a good toaster or not .
now , looking at these three reviews , or these three types of deception , you might think , wow , the internet is really making us a deceptive species , especially when you think about the astroturfing , where we can see deception brought up to scale .
now , let 's put aside the online anonymous sex chatrooms , which i 'm sure none of you have been in .
i can assure you there 's deception there .
what does technology do to deception with those folks ?
here 's a couple of studies . one of the studies we do are called diary studies , in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days , and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium , and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media .
and it really throws people for a loop because we think , well , there 's no nonverbal cues , so why do n't you lie more ?
the phone , in contrast , the most lies .
this tends to be very different from what people expect .
and what we found , to many people 's surprise , was that those linkedin résumés were more honest on the things that mattered to employers , like your responsibilities or your skills at your previous job .
how about facebook itself ?
well , one study tested this by examining people 's personalities .
well , we were really interested in it , and so what we did is we brought people , online daters , into the lab , and then we measured them . we got their height up against the wall , we put them on a scale , got their weight — ladies loved that — and then we actually got their driver 's license to get their age .
what it means is all the guys were lying about their height .
`` in fact , they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch , what we say in the lab as `` '' strong rounding up . '' '' ( laughter ) you get to 5'8 '' '' and one tenth , and boom ! 5'9 '' '' . ''
one of the reasons is pretty simple . if you go to a date , a coffee date , and you 're completely different than what you said , game over . right ? so people lied frequently , but they lied subtly , not too much . they were constrained .
well , what explains all these studies ? what explains the fact that despite our intuitions , mine included , a lot of online communication , technologically-mediated communication , is more honest than face to face ?
well , to do that , one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature .
it 's been reviewed many times . there 's been thousands of trials , hundreds of studies , and there 's some really compelling findings .
the first is , we 're really bad at detecting deception , really bad . fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not .
well it has to do with pinocchio 's nose .
if i were to ask you guys , what do you rely on when you 're looking at somebody and you want to find out if they 're lying ? what cue do you pay attention to ?
the eyes do not tell us whether somebody 's lying or not .
strange . the other thing is that just because you ca n't see me does n't mean i 'm going to lie . it 's common sense , but one important finding is that we lie for a reason .
we lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else 's gain .
most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago . that 's a long time ago .
a lot of humans have lived since then .
what 's important though is that writing only emerged about 5,000 years ago . so what that means is that all the people before there was any writing , every word that they ever said , every utterance disappeared . no trace . evanescent . gone .
so we 've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record . in fact , even the next big change to writing was only 500 years ago now , with the printing press , which is very recent in our past , and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until world war ii , so even the people of the last two millennia , most of the words they ever said — poof ! — disappeared .
how many of you have recorded something today ?
anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
in this room , right now , we 've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre-ancient history .
in fact , i think in the very near future , it 's not just what we write that will be recorded , everything we do will be recorded .
what does that mean ? what 's the next big idea from that ?
i can look at lies that before were said and then gone .
you remember those astroturfing reviews that we were talking about before ? well , when they write a fake review , they have to post it somewhere , and it 's left behind for us .
the person never was at the james hotel .
now , your task now is to decide which review is fake ?
all right . slightly more for b .
those cold , hard winters , i love it .
well , what i can do now with my colleagues in computer science is we can create computer algorithms that can analyze the linguistic traces of deception .
let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review . the first is that liars tend to think about narrative . they make up a story : who ? and what happened ? and that 's what happened here .
our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing . they also used the first person singular , i , way more than the people that actually stayed there .
they were inserting themselves into the hotel review , kind of trying to convince you they were there .
our computer algorithm is very accurate , much more accurate than humans can be , and it 's not going to be accurate all the time .
we believe that every lie now , every type of lie — fake hotel reviews , fake shoe reviews , your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging — those are all different lies . they 're going to have different patterns of language . but because everything 's recorded now , we can look at all of those kinds of lies .
it 's transformational . we 're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression , about everything from love to attitudes , because everything is being recorded now , but what does it mean for the average citizen ?
first , lying online can be very dangerous , right ?
so by all means , go ahead and do that , that 's good .
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do i want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ?
because in the digital age we live in now , in the networked age , we are all leaving a record .
thank you so much for your time , and good luck with your record . ( applause )
i 've always written primarily about architecture , about buildings , and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions .
you can smell them . you can get a feel for them .
but what was striking to me over the last several years was that less and less was i going out into the world , and more and more , i was sitting in front of my computer screen .
and what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed .
in this very short period of time , you know , whether you call it the last 15 years or so of being online , or the last , you know , four or five years of being online all the time , our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that our attention is constantly divided . you know , we 're both looking inside the screens and we 're looking out in the world around us .
and what was even more striking to me , and what i really got hung up on , was that the world inside the screen seemed to have no physical reality of its own .
we can never seem to grasp it in its totality .
and then this happened .
`` a squirrel is chewing on your internet . '' '' ( laughter ) and this seemed astounding . the internet is a transcendent idea . it 's a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions . ''
a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet . ( laughter ) and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it . where would it go ?
was the internet actually a place that you could visit ?
could i go there ? who would i meet ?
you know , was there something actually out there ?
and the answer , by all accounts , was no .
`` they say , `` '' of course not , the internet does n't weigh anything . '' '' and i was embarrassed . i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for . ''
the internet was that amorphous blob , or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it .
a building like 60 hudson , and a dozen or so others , has 10 times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings .
there 's a very short list of these places .
if the internet is a global phenomenon , if we live in a global village , it 's because there are cables underneath the ocean , cables like this .
is incredibly fast , the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second wavelength of light , maybe a thousand times your own connection , or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams , but not only that , but you 'll put not just one wavelength of light through one of the fibers , but you 'll put maybe 50 or 60 or 70 different wavelengths or colors of light through a single fiber , and then you 'll have maybe eight fibers in a cable , four going in each direction .
it 's an intensely , intensely physical process .
they looked for the unwired places , and that 's meant north and south , primarily these cables to africa .
and simon was working on a new cable , wacs , the west africa cable system , that stretched from lisbon down the west coast of africa , to cote d'ivoire , to ghana , to nigeria , to cameroon .
then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this specialized cable landing ship , and it was floated on these buoys until it was in the right place .
for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station .
it starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing .
you see the local laborers . you see the english engineer giving directions in the background . and more importantly , the places are the same . these cables still connect these classic port cities , places like lisbon , mombasa , mumbai , singapore , new york .
and then the process on shore takes around three or four days , and then , when it 's done , they put the manhole cover back on top , and they push the sand over that , and we all forget about it .
and it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud , but every time we put something on the cloud , we give up some responsibility for it .
we are less connected to it . we let other people worry about it .
and that does n't seem right .
there 's a great neal stephenson line where he says that wired people should know something about wires .
and we should know , i think , we should know where our internet comes from , and we should know what it is that physically , physically connects us all .
in the next decade ?
well , according to the governments of the world , yes we can .
can this vision for a better world really be achieved ?
and this is the world your children will live in .
this is a potential threat .
but you can see that it 's extremely faint .
and most people knock them down when they 're small .
and it goes down the sides and goes into the critter 's mouth .
we take water and push it against a membrane .
this beetle , unlike this chip bag here , this beetle uses one material , chitin .
it 's breathable . it creates color through structure .
nanotechnology , nanoparticles , you hear a lot of worry about this .
swarm technology . there is a company called regen .
( applause )
and i like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate .
( laughter ) so just to give you a bit of context , as june said , i 'm an artist , a technologist and an educator .
i teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics .
and much of what i do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form .
and it 's pretty simple .
everybody 's got one — all of you .
i can guarantee , everyone in this room , all of you over there , the people in the cushy seats , the people up top with the laptops — we all have bodies .
and so when working as an interaction designer , or as an artist who deals with participation — creating things that live on , in or around the human form — it 's really a powerful space to work within .
so i communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing .
and to tell you a bit about the things that i make , the easiest place to start the story is with a hat .
and so i went home , and i made a prototype of this hat .
( laughter ) so i make other hats as well .
it physically carves out conversation space for one .
and when you speak out loud , the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears .
( laughter ) and so when i make these things , it 's really not so much about the object itself , but rather the negative space around the object .
so what happens when a person puts this thing on ?
what kind of an experience do they have ?
so many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves .
so this particular device is called the gut listener .
so they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst .
so the discommunicator is a tool for arguments .
( laughter ) and so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered . ( laughter )
so the ear bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say .
so even though i 'm really interested in the relationship between people , i also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us .
and so when i was first living in new york city a few years back , i was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how i would like to better relate to them .
`` and i thought , `` '' well , hey ! ''
`` maybe if i want to better relate to walls , maybe i need to be more wall-like myself . '' '' so i made a wearable wall that i could wear as a backpack . ''
and so i would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that i could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me .
( laughter ) and so jumping off of that , thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world , i have this ongoing project called botanicalls — which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols .
and so glaciers are these magnificent beings , and there 's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them , but what i 'm particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations .
( laughter ) because there seems to be an issue .
the glaciers are actually leaving us .
and so i actually live in canada now , so i 've been visiting one of my local glaciers .
they actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier .
and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter .
when i meet a glacier for the very first time , what do i do ?
there 's no kind of social protocol for this .
i really just do n't even know how to say hello .
do i carve a message in the snow ?
this very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier .
( laughter ) and so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice .
and once again , it 's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .
so , yea , this is actually just the beginning .
and just as with the wall , how i wanted to be more wall-like , with this project , i 'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace .
( applause )
is there any strip lighting in your happy place ?
and we 're surrounded by natural light and organic elements .
and happiness is a great motivator ; we strive for happiness .
your phone is not very natural .
i think there are better solutions than a world mediated by screens .
reality is richer than screens .
for example , i love books .
for me they are time machines — atoms and molecules bound in space , from the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience .
but frankly , the content 's identical on my phone .
we need screens , of course .
but there 's more than you can do with these magic boxes .
so let 's recap .
humans like natural solutions .
we are the people that actually build our world , there are no artificial intelligences ...
thank you very much .
sj : i mean , picasso had a saying .
this is a sculpture i made , which is a way of , kind of , freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom .
this is a bronze ball , an aluminum arm here , and then this wooden disk .
the aluminum is because it 's very light .
the bronze is nice hard , durable material that could roll on the ground .
but in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere , it can stand up on one point .
and i thought up a lot of ideas .
the thing is , is that it 's slightly dangerous .
normally it 's sort of cordoned off when it 's in a museum .
but it 's uh — let 's see if i can manipulate it a little bit without , um — oops .
it 's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave .
and that 's what supports the object and keeps it stable .
i have a sort of a collection of videos that i took of different installations , which i could narrate .
and here is a similar sculpture .
that 's the sun at that end .
this is in a sculpture park in taejon .
this one is about the moon and then the distance to the earth , in proportion also .
this is a little stone ball , floating .
as you can see the little tether , that it 's also magnetically levitated .
and so this is the size of the sun .
and then each of these little spheres is the size of the earth in proportion to the sun .
it 's made up of 16 concentric shells . each one has 92 spheres .
this is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist .
i was thinking that the sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist . ( laughter ) so this , again , is on the subject — a slice from the equator of the earth .
it 's balancing on a shaft and a ball , right at the center of gravity , or just slightly above the center of gravity , which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty .
it 's susceptible to motion by the air currents .
so all the red sides , for example , face one direction : south .
and the blue side , the compliment , faces the other way .
so as you turn around you 're seeing different colors .
this is something i did of a tactile communication system .
it was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture , and then putting it into a communication system .
this is an idea of moving a sculpture , a ball , that would be directed around the room by a computer .
this is a clock i designed .
it turns once per day in synchrony with the earth .
and then , this is like projects that are harder to build .
( laughter ) this has a diamond-bottomed lake .
so it 's a floating island with water , fresh water , that can fly from place to place .
in the course of doing my work i sort of have a broad range of interests .
so if we could roll the next film here .
but this the current version of it , is a flying airship that is about 35 meters in diameter , about 110 feet in diameter .
i came with a plan .
i brought it to paul maccready 's company aerovironment to do a feasibility study , and they analyzed it , and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it .
so we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen .
it 's like a traveling show .
so it can see its environment , and then it can mimic its environment and disappear .
here the legs are retracting .
it weighs about 20 tons .
it has on-board generators .
the idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show .
it could be interacted with large crowds in different ways .
primarily i would be interested in how it would interact with , say , going to a college campus , and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences , the world , the situation of the globe .
the default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution earth image .
but then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues , or migrations — all of the things that we 're concerned with today .
so it could land in a park , for example .
and then it would have a corresponding website that would show the itinerary of this .
and so interacting with the same kind of imagery .
it would also be able to be an open code , so people could interact with it .
it would be forum for people 's ideas about what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type .
so that 's pretty much it .
`` twelve years ago , i was in the street writing my name to say , `` '' i exist . '' '' then i went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street to say , `` '' they exist . '' '' from the suburbs of paris to the wall of israel and palestine , the rooftops of kenya to the favelas of rio , paper and glue — as easy as that . ''
well let me tell you , in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year , because the arab spring is still spreading , the eurozone has collapsed ... what else ?
so there has been a lot of change .
one hundred thousand posters have been printed this year .
those are the kind of posters , let me show you .
this is the size .
this one was from haiti .
when i launched my wish last year , hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us .
two weeks after my speech , in tunisia , hundreds of portraits were made .
and they pasted [ over ] every single portrait of the dictator [ with ] their own photos .
`` he went with his friends in front of every russian embassy in europe and stood there with the photos to say , `` '' we have rights . '' '' they used inside out as a platform for protest . ''
sharmeen is actually here .
she organized a tedx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town .
the seventh generation are still fighting for their rights .
each time i get a wall in new york , i use his photos to continue spreading the project .
monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers and covered the entire border .
people , energy , make the glue , organize the team .
while in iran at the same time abololo — of course a nickname — has pasted one single face of a woman to show his resistance against the government .
i do n't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action .
there are tons of school projects .
twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools .
so we went there with a truck . this is a photobooth truck .
you go on the back of that truck , it takes your photo , 30 seconds later take it from the side , you 're ready to rock .
thousands of people use them and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution and then walk in the street .
this is march , the 450,000 march — beginning of september .
they were all holding their photo as a statement .
on the other side , people were wrapping up streets , buildings .
it 's everywhere .
these projects took thousands of actions in one year , making hundreds of thousands of people participating , creating millions of views .
let 's turn the world inside out together .
thank you .
( applause )
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
initially , all we did was autograph it .
these are pictures over about a six-second period .
it 's over 300 million molecular weight .
why do this ?
we have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medicines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
we now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we 're calling combinatorial genomics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
and it 's just standard selection : we can select for viability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
you 've seen this year with flu ; we 're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages 16 to 19 in the united states — leading cause of death — and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol .
so what happens ?
no one can say for sure , but i remember my first accident .
`` i 'm like , `` '' okay , all right , this guy is slowing down , i 'll slow down too . '' '' i step on the brake . ''
this guy is stopping , dead stop , dead stop on the highway .
it was just going 65 — to zero ?
i slammed on the brakes .
but i had no idea that car was stopping , and i think we can do a lot better than that .
i just want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now .
you ca n't really directly sense the world around you .
you 're in this extended body .
okay ? and all you have to guide you are your two eyes .
take your eyes off the road . that 's right .
why do we do this ? because we have to , we have to make a choice , do i look here or do i look here ?
what 's more important ?
and usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road .
`` in countless accidents , the driver says , `` i did n't see it coming . '' ''
but the technology exists now that can help us improve that .
if that guy 's going down to zero , i 'll know .
actually , no . with cars , it 's not impossible .
cars are three-dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity .
they travel down roads .
`` even if , when you 're in your car and some motorcyclist comes — bshoom ! — 85 miles an hour down , lane-splitting — i know you 've had this experience — that guy did n't `` '' just come out of nowhere . '' '' that guy 's been on the road probably for the last half hour . ''
( laughter ) right ? i mean , somebody 's seen him .
ten , 20 , 30 miles back , someone 's seen that guy , and as soon as one car sees that guy and puts him on the map , he 's on the map — position , velocity , good estimate he 'll continue going 85 miles an hour .
`` you 'll know , because your car will know , because that other car will have whispered something in his ear , like , `` '' by the way , five minutes , motorcyclist , watch out . '' '' you can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave . ''
i mean , they 're newtonian objects .
that 's very nice about them .
and same with the other cars .
they can have a precise idea of where they are , and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are .
what happens if two cars share that data , if they talk to each other ?
everybody wins .
we also attach a discrete short-range communication radio , and the robots talk to each other .
if your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories , you do n't pay as much attention to those packets .
you prioritize the one guy who seems to be going a little off course .
that guy could be a problem .
and you can predict the new trajectory .
so you do n't only know that he 's going off course , you know how .
and we wanted to do — how can we best alert everyone ?
so we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling .
fundamentally , these technologies exist today .
i think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data .
i believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs .
by sharing our data willingly , we can do what 's best for everyone .
so let your car gossip about you .
thank you .
( applause )
i want to end with a poem by an american poet called lucille clifton .
this strange-looking plant is called the llareta .
( applause )
it 's called crispr-cas9 .
part of the crispr system is a protein called cas9 , that 's able to seek out , cut and eventually degrade viral dna in a specific way .
the crispr technology has already been used to change the dna in the cells of mice and monkeys , other organisms as well .
and scientists in philadelphia showed they could use crispr to remove the dna of an integrated hiv virus from infected human cells .
what i want to do now is tell you what the crispr technology is , what it can do , where we are today and why i think we need to take a prudent path forward in the way that we employ this technology .
and these integrated bits of viral dna get inserted at a site called crispr .
crispr stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats .
it 's a mechanism that allows cells to record , over time , the viruses they have been exposed to .
and importantly , those bits of dna are passed on to the cells ' progeny , so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation , but over many generations of cells .
once those bits of dna have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome , the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called rna , which is orange in this picture , that is an exact replicate of the viral dna .
rna is a chemical cousin of dna , and it allows interaction with dna molecules that have a matching sequence .
it makes a very precise break .
that 's sort of analogous to the way that we use a word-processing program to fix a typo in a document .
the reason we envisioned using the crispr system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken dna and repair it .
so if we have a way to introduce double-stranded breaks into dna at precise places , we can trigger cells to repair those breaks , by either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information .
genome engineering is actually not new , it 's been in development since the 1970s .
we 've had technologies for sequencing dna , for copying dna , and even for manipulating dna .
i actually think that the first applications of the crispr technology are going to happen in the blood , where it 's relatively easier to deliver this tool into cells , compared to solid tissues .
the technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell 's dna affect either a tissue or , in this case , an entire organism .
imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome , and they 're otherwise completely normal .
and here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues , for example , figuring out how to deliver the crispr tool into cells .
we also want to understand better how to control the way that dna is repaired after it 's cut , and also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off-target , or unintended effects of using the technology .
i think that we will see clinical application of this technology , certainly in adults , within the next 10 years .
but we have to also consider that the crispr technology can be used for things like enhancement .
this raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider , and this is why i and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the crispr technology in human embryos , to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of doing so .
and this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility , to consider carefully both the unintended consequences as well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough .
thank you .
your attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or a quarantine is incredibly responsible .
what kind of reactions did you get back in march from your colleagues in the science world , when you asked or suggested that we should actually pause this for a moment and think about it ?
jennifer doudna : my colleagues were actually , i think , delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this openly .
bg : there 's a big meeting happening in december that you and your colleagues are calling , together with the national academy of sciences and others , what do you hope will come out of the meeting , practically ?
jd : well , i think with any new technology , especially something like this , there are going to be a variety of viewpoints , and i think that 's perfectly understandable .
i think that in the end , this technology will be used for human genome engineering , but i think to do that without careful consideration and discussion of the risks and potential complications would not be responsible .
bg : there are a lot of technologies and other fields of science that are developing exponentially , pretty much like yours .
no one seems — aside from autonomous warfare robots — nobody seems to have launched a similar discussion in those fields , in calling for a moratorium .
and i would say that i certainly hope that other technologies will be considered in the same way , just as we would want to consider something that could have implications in other fields besides biology .
( applause )
the world is filled with incredible objects and rich cultural heritage .
but most of the time , the world 's population is living without real access to arts and culture .
first , i am no expert in art or culture .
i fell into this by mistake , but i 'm loving it .
but i am , thanks to this exhibition , that has really taught me about the craftsmanship behind the soul of a japanese doll .
but this is not the purpose of my talk today .
this exists right now .
this is where i come from , todmorden .
but then , we 're just a community group , you know .
so we did some really simple things .
it 's a stylized map of togmorden .
there are millions of people who migrate each year .
there are 232 million international migrants in the world .
they actually act like an insurance .
there are .
i visited a camp for workers .
( applause )
for example , see this piece of fruit ?
and dig at it with our nails , damaging the flesh .
but something interesting happened .
see the first time you did it , you probably felt those feelings .
so why is that ?
your hands clenched at 10 and 2 on the wheel , looking at every single object out there — the cars , the lights , the pedestrians .
so much so , that i could n't even talk to anyone else in the car and i could n't even listen to music .
but then something interesting happened .
as the weeks went by , driving became easier and easier .
you habituated it .
it started to become fun and second nature .
it would be exhausting , and we 'd have no time to learn about new things .
but sometimes , habituation is n't good .
comedians know all about this .
and then he 'd turn it the other way , and it was 100 degrees too cold .
he just wanted a comfortable shower .
now , we 've all been there , we just do n't remember it .
but designers , innovators and entrepreneurs , it 's our job to not just notice those things , but to go one step further and try to fix them .
but it 's hard to solve a problem that almost no one sees .
so i remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the ipod .
but you know what ?
people liked it .
but back then , we noticed that detail and we fixed it , and now everyone else does that as well .
there 's far too many experienced people in the ted community who would know much more about that than i ever will .
and sometimes , a lot of steps after it .
take thermostats , for instance .
in the 1900s when they first came out , they were really simple to use .
you could turn them up or turn them down .
people understood them .
but it turned out that no one saved any energy .
so no one was saving energy , and what happened ?
he taught me how things were built and how they were repaired , the tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project .
i remember one story he told me about screws , and about how you need to have the right screw for the right job .
our job is to make products that are easy to install for all of our customs themselves without professionals .
so what did we do ?
but it turned out , it did n't .
and we designed a special screw , a custom screw , much to the chagrin of our investors .
`` so if we focus on those tiny details , the ones we may not see and we look at them as we say , `` '' are those important or is that the way we 've always done it ? ''
`` maybe there 's a way to get rid of those . '' '' so my last piece of advice is to think younger . ''
every day , i 'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids .
`` they come up with questions like , `` why ca n't cars fly around traffic ? '' ''
but kids have n't been around long enough to get used to those things .
for you , that could mean something else , something powerful .
my dream is to build the world 's first underground park in new york city .
it 's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical feeling that you have when you get in this space .
so , like a crazy person , i decided to quit my job and focus entirely on this project .
( applause )
my little seven-year-old picasso dreams were crushed .
lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world .
did you see wall-e ?
one of the most critical elements was how the light travels through the water .
in this clip you can see two other important elements .
here we have the fog beams .
but we are not beholden to it .
we use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder .
this guy , wall-e , is a great example of that .
but when he came in to lighting , we knew we had a big problem .
we got so geeked-out on making wall-e this convincing robot , that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect .
he does n't have a face or even traditional dialogue , for that matter .
so the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars to sell his acting and emotions .
he was starting to look glassy-eyed .
so we started with the lenses .
you can see it light up these gray aperture blades .
suddenly , those aperture blades are poking through that reflection the way nothing else has .
( video ) wall-e : eva ?
danielle feinberg : there 's a beauty in these unexpected moments — when you find the key to unlocking a robot 's soul , the moment when you discover what you want to do with your life .
there are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together .
but even through all the frustrations , i still believed it could be beautiful .
as i worked to balance the blues and the pinks , the caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells , the undulating fog beams , something promising began to appear .
i came in one morning and checked the previous night 's work .
and i got excited .
i gave my intro , and i played the jellyfish scene .
the moment where it all comes together and we get a world that we can believe in .
we use math , science and code to create these amazing worlds .
but i know where she was .
it was consistent .
this is a library in auckland .
we sign with a major label .
i become the hat after my own gigs , but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people , and unlike the guy in the opening band , i 've actually had a lot of practice standing there .
so i fought my way off my label , and for my next project with my new band , the grand theft orchestra , i turned to crowdfunding .
it 's about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough .
should we bring back the woolly mammoth ?
should we edit a human embryo ?
and my personal favorite : how can we justify wiping out an entire species that we consider harmful to humans off the face of the earth , using this technology ?
you 've got a cas9 protein and something called a guide rna .
it 's a system that we stole from an ancient , ancient bacterial immune system .
this makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use .
the first just takes the dna and shoves the two pieces back together .
it 's an ok way to maybe , like , knock out a gene , but it 's not the way that we really want to do genome editing .
the repair is made , and now the genome is safe again .
so now , you can put whatever you want in the center and the cell gets fooled .
i mean , we 've been shoving dna into organisms for years , right ?
the thing is that there 's a lot of talk about it being cheap and it being easy .
`` i 'm starting to get emails from people that say stuff like , `` '' hey , can i come to your open night and , like , maybe use crispr and engineer my genome ? '' '' ( laugher ) like , seriously . ''
so , how cheap is it ?
yeah , it is cheap in comparison .
it 's going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars , and it cuts the time a lot , too .
it can cut it from weeks to days .
that 's great .
it 's really not easy to do this kind of work .
`` it 's really fascinating to watch it happen , because they 're accusing each other of fraudulent claims and then they 've got people saying , `` oh , well , i signed my notebook here or there . '' ''
so , is it really cheap ?
we do n't really know that much about cells .
it 's ok if you use something like blood or bone marrow — those are the targets of a lot of research now .
so you take the virus , you put the crispr into it , you let the virus infect the cell .
these are not trivial questions , and there are scientists that are trying to solve them , and they will eventually , hopefully , be solved .
so : is it really easy ?
that would be kind of cool , right ?
but what is happening is that crispr is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists to do really , really important work , like making better models of diseases in animals , for example , or for taking pathways that produce valuable chemicals and getting them into industrial production in fermentation vats , or even doing really basic research on what genes do .
lots of scientists did a lot of work to make crispr happen , and what 's interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported by our society .
we 've got an infrastructure that allows a certain percentage of people to spend all their time doing research .
that makes us all the inventors of crispr , and i would say that makes us all the shepherds of crispr .
we all have a responsibility .
so i would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies , because , really , only in that way are we going to be able to guide the development of these technologies , the use of these technologies and make sure that , in the end , it 's a positive outcome — for both the planet and for us .
i heard this amazing story about miuccia prada .
she 's an italian fashion designer .
she goes to this vintage store in paris with a friend of hers .
she 's rooting around , she finds this one jacket by balenciaga — she loves it .
she 's turning it inside out .
`` her friend says , `` '' buy it already . '' '' she said , `` '' i 'll buy it , but i 'm also going to replicate it . '' '' now , the academics in this audience may think , `` well , that sounds like plagiarism . '' ''
but to a fashionista , what it really is is a sign of prada 's genius : that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that does n't need to be changed by one iota , and to be current and to be now .
they have trademark protection , but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of .
that 's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products .
but if you go to santee alley , yeah .
now , the reason for this , the reason that the fashion industry does n't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection .
they did n't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing .
now , those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection — which is that without ownership , there is no incentive to innovate — might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry .
what i 'm going to argue today is that because there 's no copyright protection in the fashion industry , fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design , things to cover our naked bodies , into something that we consider art .
maybe just a little .
now , fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry .
this wedding dress here is actually made of sporks , and this dress is actually made of aluminum .
so , one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying , which is really what it is , is the establishment of trends .
well , it 's because it 's legal for people to copy one another .
some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we 're all going to wear , but if you talk to any designer at any level , including these high-end designers , they always say their main inspiration comes from the street : where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks .
they are notorious for knocking off high-end designs and selling them at very low prices .
`` the courts have said over and over again , `` '' you do n't need any more intellectual property protection . '' '' when you look at copies like this , you wonder : how do the luxury high-end brands remain in business ? ''
`` we invited tom ford to come — the conference was called , `` '' ready to share : fashion and the ownership of creativity '' '' — and we asked him exactly this question . ''
here 's what he had to say .
tom ford : and we found after much research that — actually not much research , quite simple research — that the counterfeit customer was not our customer .
johanna blakley : imagine that .
and , you know , a knock-off is never the same as an original high-end design , at least in terms of the materials ; they 're always made of cheaper materials .
but even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects , can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend .
fashion , whether you like it or not , helps you project who you are to the world .
and this , actually , is good news to trendsetters ; they want trends to be set so that they can move product .
and so , they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible .
he has complained a lot about people copying him , but in one interview i read , he said it has really forced him to up his game .
he came up with this bowden-wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium ; if you make it from some sort of cheaper material , it 'll actually crack in two .
it forced him to be a little more innovative . ( music ) and that actually reminded me of jazz great , charlie parker .
i do n't know if you 've heard this anecdote , but i have .
i love these gallianos .
okay , we 'll move on . ( laughter ) this is not unlike the world of comedy .
i do n't know if you know that jokes also ca n't be copyright protected .
they develop a persona , a signature style , much like fashion designers .
and their jokes , much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer , really only work within that aesthetic .
they make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic : the santee alley demographic .
`` now , some fashion designers will say , `` '' it 's only in the united states that we do n't have any respect . ''
`` in other countries there is protection for our artful designs . '' '' but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world , it turns out that the protection that 's offered is really ineffectual . ''
and that 's sort of like the novelty standard for a u.s. patent , which fashion designers never get — rarely get here in the states .
in the european union , they went in the other direction .
very low novelty standard , anybody can register anything .
so , that does not stop the knock-off artists .
but this has not stopped diane von furstenberg .
she is the head of the council of fashion designers of america , and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection for fashion designs .
who owns a look ?
you know , it 's not just the fashion industry that does n't have copyright protection .
same with automobiles .
it does n't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look , you can not copyright the sculptural design .
it 's a utilitarian article , that 's why .
same with furniture , it 's too utilitarian .
magic tricks , i think they 're instructions , sort of like recipes : no copyright protection .
open source software , these guys decided they did n't want copyright protection .
they thought it 'd be more innovative without it .
it 's really hard to get copyright for databases .
and some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you , but these are the gross sales for low i.p . industries , industries with very little copyright protection , and there 's the gross sales of films and books .
( applause ) it ai n't pretty . ( applause )
`` so you talk to people in the fashion industry and they 're like , `` '' shhh ! ''
`` it 's embarrassing . '' '' but you know what ? it 's revolutionary , and it 's a model that a lot of other industries — like the ones we just saw with the really small bars — they might have to think about this . ''
because right now , those industries with a lot of copyright protection are operating in an atmosphere where it 's as if they do n't have any protection , and they do n't know what to do .
`` when i found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that did n't have copyright protection , i thought , `` '' what exactly is the underlying logic ? ''
`` i want a picture . '' '' and the lawyers do not provide a picture , so i made one . ''
these are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law .
it is more complex than this , but this will do .
then no , it does not deserve protection .
this is a difficult , unstable binary .
the other one is : is it an idea ?
is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society ?
no protection .
nowadays , we do n't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold .
it 's a digital file .
and these things , because we can copy and transmit them so easily , actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects .
they 're smart .
but you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out , trying to figure out : what is the kind of ownership model , in a digital world , that 's going to lead to the most innovation ?
and my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future .
and i really want to thank veronica jauriqui for making this very fashionable presentation .
i worried that i would regret an abortion later .
but polly had given me a very special gift : the knowledge that i was n't alone and the realization that abortion was something that we can talk about .
one way is to listen closely .
the feminist who regrets her abortion .
the catholic who is grateful for hers .
it 's not easy . it 's very hard .
it creates a culture and a society that values what make us special and unique .
i would n't even call it restoration ; it was a ritual , catharsis .
pickles ?
simple designs for infection control had not been thought about , and people had died because of it .
`` `` '' where are the architects ? '' '' paul said . ''
that following summer , i was in the back of a land rover with a few classmates , bumping over the mountainous hillside of rwanda .
i was there to design and build a new type of hospital with dr. farmer and his team .
it 's beautiful .
and even in poughkeepsie , my hometown , we thought about old industrial infrastructure .
in each of these projects , we asked a simple question : what more can architecture do ?
about a year ago , i read an article about a tireless and intrepid civil rights leader named bryan stevenson .
it overlooked the whole city .
their names will be engraved on the markers that hang above us .
but these are temporary columns , waiting in purgatory , to be placed in the very counties where these lynchings occurred .
our nation will begin to heal from over a century of silence .
brian and his team have begun collecting that soil and preserving it in individual jars with family members , community leaders and descendants .
it 's an act of restorative justice .
we live in a galaxy , the milky way galaxy .
every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our milky way — a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs .
( laughter ) which tells you something about our place in the universe .
it 's extremely beautiful .
one big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time .
if you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity , it would be moving away from you .
and if you look at a galaxy even farther away , it would be moving away faster .
what that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were closer together .
if you squeeze things together , the temperature goes up .
that kind of makes sense to us .
in particular , things were a lot denser .
because if there had been , they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole .
it 's a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly .
there is something that made it that way .
we would like to know what .
it 's the randomness , the disorder , the chaoticness of some systems .
if you have the air in this room , you do n't notice each individual atom .
a low entropy configuration is one in which there 's only a few arrangements that look that way .
a high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way .
this insight that entropy increases , by the way , is what 's behind what we call the arrow of time , the difference between the past and the future .
every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing — the fact that you can remember the past , but not the future .
the fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that 's because entropy is increasing .
the fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very , very smooth .
we 'd like to understand that .
that 's our job as cosmologists .
unfortunately , it 's actually not a problem that we 've been giving enough attention to .
`` it 's not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern cosmologist , `` what are the problems we 're trying to address ? '' ''
`` so he says — i 'm not going to do the accent — he says , `` '' for some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy content , and since then the entropy has increased . ''
it 's not true that we 've figured it out by now .
the universe is not only expanding .
if you look at the galaxy , it 's moving away .
if you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be moving away faster .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we do n't know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that 's the theory of dark energy .
in every little cubic centimeter of space , whether or not there 's stuff , whether or not there 's particles , matter , radiation or whatever , there 's still energy , even in the space itself .
and this energy , according to einstein , exerts a push on the universe .
it is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other .
because dark energy , unlike matter or radiation , does not dilute away as the universe expands .
this has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future .
for one thing , the universe will expand forever .
back when i was your age , we did n't know what the universe was going to do .
einstein was fond of this idea .
but if there 's dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever .
14 billion years in the past , 100 billion dog years , but an infinite number of years into the future .
there 's a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon .
so even though time goes on forever , space is limited to us .
in the 1970s , stephen hawking told us that a black hole , even though you think it 's black , it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics .
the curvature of space-time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation , and the black hole radiates .
and so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away , there will always be some radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
so what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever .
he said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy .
but that 's a probabilistic statement .
it will probably increase , and the probability is enormously huge .
except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever , that would happen .
he did n't know about the big bang . he did n't know about the expansion of the universe .
so his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere — the everything molecules .
but if you 're boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations .
and then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will expand back .
so it 's not that entropy must always increase — you can get fluctuations into lower entropy , more organized situations .
he says , the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we ca n't live there .
remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time .
we would not be able to process information , metabolize , walk and talk , if we lived in thermal equilibrium .
so if you imagine a very , very big universe , an infinitely big universe , with randomly bumping into each other particles , there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states , and then they relax back .
occasionally , you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies .
now your homework assignment is to really think about this , to contemplate what it means .
`` carl sagan once famously said that `` '' in order to make an apple pie , you must first invent the universe . '' '' but he was not right . ''
that will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven , and then making you an apple pie .
the good news is that , therefore , this scenario does not work ; it is not right .
and feynman also understood this .
`` feynman says , `` '' from the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation , all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we 've never seen before , we will find it mixed up , and not like the piece we 've just looked at — high entropy . ''
( laughter ) here is the universe that we tell you about , versus the universe that really exists .
the universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so .
it 's cooling off .
but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
if the dark energy remains around , the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel , they will stop burning .
they will evaporate , and we will be left with nothing but empty space .
however , you notice , since empty space gives off radiation , there 's actually thermal fluctuations , and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space .
so here 's two questions for you .
why are n't we in empty space ?
`` you might say , `` '' well there 's nothing there to be living , '' '' but that 's not right . ''
either it 's just like that . there is no explanation .
this is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions .
`` an egg , an unbroken egg , is a low entropy configuration , and yet , when we open our refrigerator , we do not go , `` '' hah , how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator . '' '' that 's because an egg is not a closed system ; it comes out of a chicken . ''
if that 's true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bigger multiverse .
so the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation .
my bold speculation is that i will be absolutely vindicated by history .
and even better , we will understand what happened at the big bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations .
it 's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday .
thank you .
poem 2 : oh ! kangaroos , sequins , chocolate sodas ! / you are really beautiful !
let 's play our third and final test .
so what do we take from all of this ?
do we take that william blake is somehow more of a human than gertrude stein ?
can we build an intelligent computer ?
( laughter ) okay , speaker lawrence lessig , right .
okay .
okay , see ? it 's done . it 's almost done . here we go .
okay , but no , this is really besides the point .
they hold potluck dinners .
indeed , they sell books about potluck dinners .
they share , they give , they give away for free .
and not only food , right .
these very same people are strong believers , in lots of contexts , in the limits on the markets .
indeed , they , like all of us , celebrate this kind of relationship .
they want to regulate us , those conservatives , to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places .
because they understand : there are places for the market and places where the market should not exist , where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others .
they recognize : both of these things have to live together .
which , of course , spread virally .
js : there 's obviously also something really deeply great about this .
they are acting in the sense that they 're emulating the original mashup .
and the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye and some experience with video editing .
it 's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art .
ll : right . bingo . point .
the point is they , he , here , gets that culture .
this guy is no republican .
the mashup is owned by lucas .
there is no creator here to be recognized .
the creator does n't have any rights .
our lives are sharing activities , at least in part .
that 's number one . number two : this ecology of sharing needs freedom within which to create .
these tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely .
and it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy that 's obviously developed around these licenses , as now more than 350 million digital objects are out there , licensed freely in this way .
i went to this site , and i had to answer these questions .
it is outrageous .
now , that was the story of me then , my good old days of right-wing lunacy .
openness is a commitment to a certain set of values .
we need to speak of those values .
it 's a value of the limits in regulation .
it 's a value respecting the creator .
( applause )
we also have to have energy .
we also have to have organic material — things that make us up , but also things that we need to consume .
why ? we look at the inner planets .
venus is way too hot — it 's got no water .
it 's got no water .
but recent observations have changed all that .
it 's now turning our attention to the right places for us to take a deeper look and really start to answer our life question .
so when we look out into the solar system , where are the possibilities ?
we 're concentrating our attention on four locations .
the planet mars and then three moons of the outer planets : titan , europa and small enceladus .
so what about mars ?
curiosity has also drilled in that red soil and brought up other material .
we brought it into the rover , we tasted it , and guess what ?
and is that life still there ?
we do n't know that .
in its past it had perhaps two-thirds of its northern hemisphere — there was an ocean .
we 're going to launch a series of missions to begin that search for life on mars .
as we move out into the solar system , here 's the tiny moon enceladus .
cassini was there since 2006 , and after a couple years looked back after it flew by enceladus and surprised us all .
what a fabulous environment .
now , the only thing that we can think of that does that here on earth as an analogy ...
hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean were discovered in 1977 .
well , we believe because it has water and has had it for a significant period of time , and we believe it has hydrothermal vents with perhaps the right organic material , it is a place where life could exist .
another moon , very similar , is europa .
europa , we also know , has an under-the-ice crust ocean .
but we did n't look for them .
titan is a huge moon of saturn .
it has an extensive atmosphere .
it 's so extensive — and it 's mostly nitrogen with a little methane and ethane — that you have to peer through it with radar .
we see lakes ...
actually almost the size of our black sea in some places .
and this area is not liquid water ; it 's methane .
( applause )
all right , so let 's take four subjects that obviously go together : big data , tattoos , immortality and the greeks .
right ?
now , the issue about tattoos is that , without a word , tattoos really do shout .
[ allegiance ] [ very intimate ] [ serious mistakes ] ( laughter ) and tattoos tell you a lot of stories .
if i can ask an indiscreet question , how many of you have tattoos ?
what happens if facebook , google , twitter , linkedin , cell phones , gps , foursquare , yelp , travel advisor , all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos ?
and what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would ?
what 's ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are tweeting , blogging , following you , watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself .
so you can take a picture with an iphone and get all the names , although , again , sometimes it does make mistakes . ( laughter ) but that means you can take a typical bar scene like this , take a picture , say , of this guy right here , get the name , and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody , because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos .
and so there 's companies like face.com that now have about 18 billion faces online .
here 's what happened to this company .
here 's andy 's theory .
[ in the future , everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes . ] what if we flip this ?
why the greeks ?
remember ? he did a horrible thing , condemned for all time to roll this rock up , it would roll back down , roll back up , roll back down .
it 's a little like your reputation .
so he 's walking out and walking out and walking out and he just ca n't resist . he looks at her , loses her forever .
lesson number three : atalanta .
greatest runner . she would challenge anybody .
if you won , she would marry you .
if you lost , you died .
how did hippomenes beat her ?
she 'd run ahead , and he 'd roll a little golden apple .
she kept getting distracted . he eventually won the race .
just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a late-night message .
nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with narcissus .
last lesson , from a latin american : this is the great poet jorge luis borges .
`` when he was threatened by the thugs of the argentine military junta , he came back and said , `` '' oh , come on , how else can you threaten , other than with death ? '' '' the interesting thing , the original thing , would be to threaten somebody with immortality . ''
and that , of course , is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos .
now , you need a laptop .
and what we 're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .
this is about justice . really .
we like to give , and we give a lot .
because there is no way we can look at what 's happening in africa , and if we 're honest , conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else .
they 're attempting to bring order to chaos .
there 's an opportunity here , and it 's real .
does n't compassion look well on us ?
the neon sign is fizzing and cracking .
the regional branch managers are getting nervous .
never before have we in the west been so scrutinized .
you see , the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference .
i really believe that , the people in this room .
this is what excites me .
most of you did , the digital world .
actually , i come from punk rock .
lurching a little , but it 's building .
and what we did or did not do to put out the fires in africa .
the ones that ted has offered to grant .
( laughter ) i should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes .
we just need your help in making it happen .
one , by one , by one .
that is my wish , my third wish .
the average waiting time to get a landline in ethiopia is actually about seven or eight years .
and that is my third and final wish for you at the ted conference .
where do you come from ?
it 's such a simple question , but these days , of course , simple questions bring ever more complicated answers .
i do actually feel more alien the longer i live there .
and in so many ways , i think this is a terrific liberation .
because when my grandparents were born , they pretty much had their sense of home , their sense of community , even their sense of enmity , assigned to them at birth , and did n't have much chance of stepping outside of that .
certainly when i 'm traveling , especially to the major cities of the world , the typical person i meet today will be , let 's say , a half-korean , half-german young woman living in paris .
she realizes that she probably has much more in common with him than with anybody entirely of korea or entirely of germany .
they move to new york city .
( laughter ) or edinburgh .
you all know that crazy system , six days in hell , you get the seventh day free .
`` `` '' well — '' '' here my friend hemmed and hawed — `` well , actually it 's a catholic hermitage . '' ''
this was the wrong answer .
the whole place was absolutely silent , but the silence was n't an absence of noise .
it was really a presence of a kind of energy or quickening .
and it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day vanishing .
but i do think it 's only by stopping movement that you can see where to go .
but movement , ultimately , only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to .
thank you .
a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task , until now .
hello , my name is dennis hong , and we 're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired .
so before i talk about this car for the blind , let me briefly tell you about another project that i worked on called the darpa urban challenge .
now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself .
so about that time , the national federation of the blind , or nfb , challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently .
we just put a blind person in it and we 're done , right ?
( laughter ) we could n't have been more wrong .
what nfb wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around , but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive .
so to test this crazy idea , we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility .
and in the summer of 2009 , we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin .
it was an absolutely amazing experience .
but the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment , in a flat , closed-off parking lot — even the lanes defined by red traffic cones .
so with this success , we decided to take the next big step , to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads .
so how does it work ?
we have perception , computation and non-visual interfaces .
now obviously the driver can not see , so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver .
so it measures acceleration , angular acceleration — like a human ear , inner ear .
we fuse that information with a gps unit to get an estimate of the location of the car .
we also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road .
the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles — a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
so we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle .
but the problem is this : how do we convey this information and instructions to a person who can not see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive ?
so starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system , a vibrating vest , a click wheel with voice commands , a leg strip , even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot .
but today we 're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces .
now the first interface is called a drivegrip .
so these are a pair of gloves , and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer — the direction and the intensity .
another device is called speedstrip .
so this is a chair — as a matter of fact , it 's actually a massage chair .
we gut it out , and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns , and we actuate them to convey information about the speed , and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal .
so over here , you can see how the computer understands the environment , and because you can not see the vibration , we actually put red led 's on the driver so that you can see what 's happening .
but the problem is these are instructional cue devices .
so this is not really freedom , right ?
the computer tells you how to drive — turn left , turn right , speed up , stop .
so think of it as a monitor for the blind .
so even though you are blind , you can put your hand over it , you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles .
so it 's actually a multi-dimensional user interface .
so here you can see the left camera , the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix .
for this , we 're showing a simulator , a blind person driving using the airpix .
this simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces .
we also had some surprises . let 's take a look .
( music ) ( video ) announcer : this is an historic day in january .
( cheering ) ( honking ) there 's the grandstand now .
well there comes the first box .
third box is out . the fourth box is out .
he 's closing in on the van to make the moving pass .
well this is what it 's all about , this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity .
mark riccobono : yes .
( applause ) dh : so since we started this project , we 've been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
`` letters thanking us , but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one : `` now i understand why there is braille on a drive-up atm machine . '' ''
but still , will the society , would they accept such a radical idea ?
there 's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality .
of course , the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind .
but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .
and together with this new type of interfaces , we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people .
so today , the things i 've showed you today , is just the beginning .
thank you very much .
i am passionate about the american landscape and how the physical form of the land , from the great central valley of california to the bedrock of manhattan , has really shaped our history and our character .
but one thing is clear .
in the last 100 years alone , our country — and this is a sprawl map of america — our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we 've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet .
and it 's really a conflux of urban population rising , biodiversity plummeting and also , of course , sea levels rising and climate changing .
`` and you can see from the arrow here indicating `` '' you are here , '' '' i 'm trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology , and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way . ''
we need new tools and new approaches .
so we need new stories , new heroes and new tools .
`` so the oyster was the basis for a manifesto-like urban design project that i did about the new york harbor called `` '' oyster-tecture . '' '' and the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power of mussels , eelgrass and oysters — species that live in the harbor — and , at the same time , harness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now . ''
and what 's circled is the site that i 'm going to talk about , the gowanus canal and governors island .
but you can see , even just intuit , from this map , that the harbor has dredged and flattened , and went from a rich , three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck in really a matter of years .
now the gowanus is particularly smelly — i will admit it .
there are problems of sewage overflow and contamination , but i would also argue that almost every city has this exact condition , and it 's a condition that we 're all facing .
so we really had a lot to deal with .
when we started this project , one of the core ideas was to look back in history and try to understand what was there .
and the idea has two core stages .
so the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way , i think .
here we are , back to our hero , the oyster .
it accepts algae and detritus in one end , and through this beautiful , glamorous set of stomach organs , out the other end comes cleaner water .
they were key in our culture and our economy .
basically , new york was built on the backs of oystermen , and our streets were literally built over oyster shells .
this image is an image of an oyster cart , which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today .
so again , we got the short end of the deal there .
and they become the bedrock of any harbor ecosystem .
many , many species depend on them .
so we were inspired by the oyster , but i was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster .
it can move from a fertilized egg to a spat , which is when they 're floating through the water , and when they 're ready to attach onto another oyster , to an adult male oyster or female oyster , in a number of weeks .
we reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the gowanus , then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the bayridge reef .
how does the reef work ? well , it 's very , very simple .
a core concept here is that climate change is n't something that — the answers wo n't land down from the moon .
so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project .
( laughter ) so in the studio , rather than drawing , we began to learn how to knit .
and that grows over time dynamically with the threat of climate change .
it also creates this incredibly interesting , i think , new amphibious public space , where you can imagine working , you can imagine recreating in a new way .
in the end , what we realized we were making was a new blue-green watery park for the next watery century — an amphibious park , if you will .
so get your tevas on .
so you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water , and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring .
and then those spat are then seeded .
new word .
and finally , how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef .
and the second one is : when can we eat the oysters ?
and the answer is : not yet , they 're working .
thank you .
( applause )
now , montel williams is an intelligent man .
i mean that 's a fabulous amount of money .
this was done under local anesthesia , as an outpatient .
this began an incredible archaeological partnership .
the thrill of archaeological discovery is as powerful as love , because ancient history is the most seductive mistress imaginable .
many seek .
some discover .
on the dig , surrounded by emerald green rice paddies , i discovered an intact pot .
for a moment , time stood still .
i ca n't tell you how many times i 've stood in front of the pyramids of giza , and they leave me speechless .
they 're a monument to our human brilliance and everything that is possible .
the great pyramid of giza was built one stone at a time with 2.3 million blocks , with incredible bureaucratic efficiency .
history may be cyclical , but we are singular .
and also , we 've been posting on walls and obsessing about cats — ( laughter ) for thousands of years . ( laughter )
that 's 10 inches .
let me repeat that .
you ca n't see anything .
when we process the image using algorithms — think like a space-based cat scan — this is what you see .
but we have a challenge .
isil has destroyed temples at palmyra .
knowing isil 's desire to destroy modern human lives , it 's a natural extension for them to destroy cultural identity as well .
we would all do the same to feed our families ; i do n't blame the local looters .
this is beginning to change .
my team and i have just completed a study looking at looting in egypt .
it 's astonishing .
at one site , the looting got bad from 2009 , 2011 , 2012 — hundreds and hundreds of pits .
if we do nothing to stop the problem , all of egypt 's sites will be affected by looting by 2040 .
i am just back from the field , where i co-led a joint mission with egypt 's ministry of antiquities at a site called lisht .
north lisht .
let me put into perspective for you what was taken .
for the ancient egyptians , having their name last for eternity was their goal .
working together with my egyptian team , we had restored someone 's name from 3,900 years ago .
we found this incredible false door , mostly intact .
what i realized is that everything i had assumed about looted sites had been proven wrong .
every day on site we worked together with 70 egyptians as colleagues and friends .
what i learned this season is that archaeology is n't about what you find .
this is omer farrouk , my brother .
guftis are part of a celebrated tradition in egyptology .
omer is my coo and cfo .
twins .
i knew then we 'd always work together — not in my brain , but in the part of your soul that knows not everything can be explained .
( english ) omer my brother , i will always love you .
we are going to build with the ted prize money an online , crowdsource , citizen science platform to allow anyone in the world to engage with discovering archaeological sites .
there are only a couple hundred of us space archaeologists around the world .
you 'll then be dealt a card from a deck — 20 x 20 meters or 30 x 30 meters , and you 'll be looking for features .
but it 's not just going to stop there .
now it 's primarily for academics .
who is the next howard carter ?
if we want to learn about the past , it 's time we inverted the pyramids .
acknowledging that the past is worth saving means so much more .
but the only way we 're going to be able to write it is if we do it together .
thank you .
let 's start with the hobbies . when you get dementia , it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself .
but , you know , it does n't matter if i 'm actually good at it . what matters is that my hands know how to do it .
what is it that french people do better than all the others ?
( laughter ) maybe .
what is it that we find so sexy in math ?
after all , it seems to be dull and abstract , just numbers and computations and rules to apply .
it is about reasoning and proving our core activity .
it is about finding the truth .
the reward may be big .
they are inaccessible to our senses but can be seen through mathematical lenses .
invisible particles from the air around are bumping on you by the billions and billions at each second , all in complete chaos .
and open your eyes now to the statistics of the velocities of these particles .
the famous bell-shaped gauss curve , or the law of errors — of deviations with respect to the mean behavior .
this curve tells about the statistics of velocities of particles in the same way as a demographic curve would tell about the statistics of ages of individuals .
it 's one of the most important curves ever .
aha .
our supreme goddess of unreason .
for you i have shown it , but to my students i explain why it could not be any other curve .
they also change our vision of the world .
for instance , einstein , perrin , smoluchowski , they used the mathematical analysis of random trajectories and the gauss curve to explain and prove that our world is made of atoms .
in those days , only a small fraction of the world had been explored , and the earth might have seemed infinite .
here 's another example .
in 1673 , jean richer noticed that a pendulum swings slightly slower in cayenne than in paris .
here 's a modern example you will all relate to : searching the internet .
the world wide web , more than one billion web pages — do you want to go through them all ?
let 's work out a baby problem .
imagine that you 're a detective working on a crime case , and there are many people who have their version of the facts .
sensible answer : prime witnesses .
which ones are the most authoritative ?
enter pagerank , one of the early cornerstones of google .
so let 's send into this graph a bunch of tiny , digital marbles and let them go randomly through the graph .
here we go .
once again , the solution emerges from the randomness .
and still , just one problem in a million .
with the advent of digital area , more and more problems lend themselves to mathematical analysis , making the job of mathematician a more and more useful one , to the extent that a few years ago , it was ranked number one among hundreds of jobs in a study about the best and worst jobs published by the wall street journal in 2009 .
and why not stochastic processes , linear programming , or fluid simulation ?
each of these fields have monster industrial applications .
but do n't you think that the life a mathematical researcher is an easy one .
it is filled with perplexity , frustration , a desperate fight for understanding .
let me evoke for you one of the most striking days in my mathematician 's life .
it was all about understanding the paradoxical stability property of plasmas , which are a crowd of electrons .
in the perfect world of plasma , there are no collisions and no friction to provide the stability like we are used to .
but still , if you slightly perturb a plasma equilibrium , you will find that the resulting electric field spontaneously vanishes , or damps out , as if by some mysterious friction force .
i was putting in there all my energy and experience and tricks , and still nothing was working .
1 a.m. , 2 a.m. , 3 a.m. , not working .
around 4 a.m. , i go to bed in low spirits .
you see , i thought i had taken some rest , but really my brain had continued to work on it .
and gratitude to the many collaborators who made this possible .
so the question is , what is invisible ?
everything , i would say . everything that matters except every thing and except matter .
we can see matter . but we ca n't see what 's the matter .
with matter , as with people , we see only the skin of things .
we ca n't see what makes people tick , at least not without difficulty .
electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz , and there is only energy . and you ca n't see energy .
so everything that matters , that 's important , is invisible .
and i 'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds .
wherever he went , at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness .
( laughter ) try as he might , he could n't get away from her .
a few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him , had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph .
after her name , written in brackets was the apt description , horse face .
`` ( laughter ) `` '' i 've misjudged this women , '' '' thought mr . dickens . ''
`` `` '' not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness , she turns it to her advantage . ''
`` a photo is not enough . '' '' so he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in . ''
`` and on the photograph , he wrote with a flourish , `` to horse face , with love from geoffrey dickens , m.p . '' ''
`` after it had been sent off , his secretary said to him , `` '' did you get that letter from the woman at the fete ? ''
so , one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we ca n't see we also ca n't understand .
gravity is one thing that we ca n't see and which we do n't understand .
is n't that incredible that we ca n't read each other 's minds ?
but we ca n't read each other 's minds . i find that quite astonishing .
so that 's why we do n't think it exists , the sufi masters working on us .
with artificial intelligence , not only have they not created artificial intelligence , they have n't yet created artificial stupidity .
interesting . i 'm , as you can guess , not a materialist , i 'm an immaterialist .
i 'm an ignostic .
( laughter ) another thing we ca n't see is the human genome .
geneticists will know this , but every year since , it 's been revised downwards .
this is extraordinary . because rice — get this — rice is known to have 38 thousand genes .
two more than people , and the same as a gorilla .
( laughter ) you ca n't see these things , but they are very strange . ( laughter )
the more light there is , the less you can see .
time , nobody can see time .
`` one of the interesting things about the past is you particularly ca n't see . my son asked me this the other day , he said , `` '' dad , can you remember what i was like when i was two ? '' '' and i said , `` '' yes . '' '' and he said , `` '' why ca n't i ? '' '' is n't that extraordinary ? you can not remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three , which is great news for psychoanalysts , because otherwise they 'd be out of a job . ''
because that 's where all the stuff happens ( laughter ) that makes you who you are .
this is fascinating . you probably know , some of you , that cells are continually renewed . you can see it in skin and this kind of stuff .
but every cell in your body is replaced at some point .
but at the end of seven years , not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago .
okay . atoms , you ca n't see them .
gas was invented in 1600 by a dutch chemist called van helmont .
( laughter ) but well done , him . ( laughter )
there is so many things that — light .
but it 's odd that you ca n't see the beam of light , you can only see what it hits .
electricity , you ca n't see that .
do n't let anyone tell you they understand electricity .
they do n't . nobody knows what it is .
100 billion . how many can we see ? five .
radio waves . there 's another thing .
`` what 's the point of these radio waves that you 've found ? '' '' and he said , `` '' well , i 've no idea . ''
`` but i guess somebody will find a use for them someday . '' '' and that 's what they do , radio . that 's what they discovered . ''
`` `` '' why are we here ? '' '' and `` '' what should we do about it while we are ? ''
and to help you , i 've got two things to leave you with , from two great philosophers , perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century , one a mathematician and an engineer , and the other a poet .
`` but i 'm pretty sure it 's not in order to enjoy ourselves . '' '' ( laughter ) he was a cheerful bastard was n't he ? ( laughter ) ''
`` and secondly and lastly , w.h . auden , one of my favorite poets , who said , `` '' we are here on earth to help others . ''
wetlands , globally , are one of the most endangered ecosystems .
this is the infrastructure as we see it about now .
and we can do that .
it 's nothing if not ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
this was the result .
( applause )
whether they leak out depends on their size .
we designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes .
one enzyme can activate a thousand of these chemical reactions in an hour .
or maybe we want make something that 's more inexpensive and portable .
alright , where are we going with this ?
thank you .
there was no responsibility .
we had a global bubble .
you . yeah . ( laughter ) with the weird teeth . and you next to him . ( laughter ) you know who you are .
actually , that whole row is n't right . ( laughter ) that 's not good . hi . yeah . real bad . do n't even look at me . ( laughter ) i am one of the one in four . thank you .
i think i inherit it from my mother , who , used to crawl around the house on all fours .
so how did it start ?
my mental illness — well , i 'm not even going to talk about my mental illness .
so i took to my bed for about a month , and when i woke up i found i was institutionalized , and when i saw the other inmates , i realized that i had found my people , my tribe . ( laughter ) because they became my only friends , they became my friends , because very few people that i knew — well , i was n't sent a lot of cards or flowers . i mean , if i had had a broken leg or i was with child i would have been inundated , but all i got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up .
`` because i did n't think of that . ( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) because , you know , the one thing , one thing that you get with this disease , this one comes with a package , is you get a real sense of shame , because your friends go , `` '' oh come on , show me the lump , show me the x-rays , '' '' and of course you 've got nothing to show , so you 're , like , really disgusted with yourself because you 're thinking , `` i 'm not being carpet-bombed . i do n't live in a township . '' ''
but we all know in here , you know , there is no devil , there are no voices in your head .
there is some good news . first of all , let me say , we 've come a long , long way .
here we 've got a little bit of long-term memory , so , you know that night you want to forget , when you got really drunk ? bye-bye ! gone . ( laughter ) so actually , it 's filled with 100 billion neurons just zizzing away , electrically transmitting information , zizzing , zizzing . i 'm going to give you a little side view here .
for every one single neuron , you can actually have from 10,000 to 100,000 different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it , and every time you learn something , or you have an experience , that bush grows , you know , that bush of information .
this is n't for the one in four . this is for the four in four .
we are not equipped for the 21st century .
because i 'll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution . okay , let me just explain this to you .
`` oh my god , everybody can see i 'm stupid . i did n't get invited to the christmas party ! '' '' so you 've got this nagging loop tape that goes over and over again that drives you insane , so , you see what the problem is ? what once made you safe now drives you insane . ''
i 'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news , but somebody has to be .
the industrial era started two seconds ago .
another way to look at this is to think of world gdp over the last 10,000 years , i 've actually taken the trouble to plot this for you in a graph .
( laughter ) it 's a curious shape for a normal condition .
look at these two highly distinguished gentlemen : we have kanzi — he 's mastered 200 lexical tokens , an incredible feat .
and ed witten unleashed the second superstring revolution .
some of my colleagues think we 're on the verge of something that could cause a profound change in that substrate , and that is machine superintelligence .
artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box .
basically , you got out only what you put in .
the result is a.i . that is not limited to one domain — the same system can learn to translate between any pairs of languages , or learn to play any computer game on the atari console .
so the question is , how far are we from being able to match those tricks ?
and the median answer was 2040 or 2050 , depending on precisely which group of experts we asked .
this comes down to physics .
a biological neuron fires , maybe , at 200 hertz , 200 times a second .
in this century , scientists may learn to awaken the power of artificial intelligence .
so at one end we have the village idiot , and then far over at the other side we have ed witten , or albert einstein , or whoever your favorite guru is .
and then , after many , many more years of really hard work , lots of investment , maybe eventually we get to chimpanzee-level artificial intelligence .
now a good question is , what are those preferences ?
a superintelligence is a really strong optimization process .
this means that there is no necessary connection between being highly intelligent in this sense , and having an objective that we humans would find worthwhile or meaningful .
when the a.i . becomes superintelligent , it realizes that the most effective way to get the solution to this problem is by transforming the planet into a giant computer , so as to increase its thinking capacity .
and notice that this gives the a.i.s an instrumental reason to do things to us that we might not approve of .
this is a lesson that 's also taught in many a myth .
king midas wishes that everything he touches be turned into gold .
a , this is not necessarily so easy to do if we 've grown dependent on the system — like , where is the off switch to the internet ?
they certainly had reasons .
but so could a superintelligent agent , and it would be much better at that than we are .
the point is , we should not be confident that we have this under control here .
but how confident can we be that the a.i . could n't find a bug .
given that merely human hackers find bugs all the time , i 'd say , probably not very confident .
so we disconnect the ethernet cable to create an air gap , but again , like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps using social engineering .
i believe that the answer here is to figure out how to create superintelligent a.i . such that even if — when — it escapes , it is still safe because it is fundamentally on our side because it shares our values .
i see no way around this difficult problem .
now , i 'm actually fairly optimistic that this problem can be solved .
instead , we would create an a.i . that uses its intelligence to learn what we value , and its motivation system is constructed in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions that it predicts we would approve of .
but it does n't happen automatically .
making superintelligent a.i . that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that .
now it might be that we can not solve the entire control problem in advance because maybe some elements can only be put in place once you know the details of the architecture where it will be implemented .
and then i waited .
this year we celebrate our 50th year of stable democracy .
but very soon , i would shed siswati .
it was africans in cocktail bars in nairobi .
we were standing in the middle of something amazing , because for the first time ever young africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time , without the restriction of borders , finances and watchful governments .
when disaster hits , when turmoil hits , we share the consequences .
africa has six of the world 's largest refugee centers .
how can we do that ?
but i think that the biggest way for africa to share its successes is to foster something i like to call social pan-africanism .
using the internet , we can begin to think collaboratively , we can begin to innovate together .
and this is already happening .
but now we have opportunities to back each other up in ways we never could before .
we support angolan journalists who are being illegally detained .
thank you .
if you put too much cold water in , it will shatter .
there has to be a willingness to do good deeds , but not , of course , at the expense of our own sanity .
what does this compassion entail ?
and , as many people do , he was dozing off during the sermon .
and he called the two of them to his office .
`` `` you mean god did n't want my bread ? '' ''
`` you 've misunderstood totally , '' '' he said . ''
and i 've been writing about these creatures ever since .
if the infected rat smells the delightful odor of cat piss , it runs towards the source of the smell rather than the more sensible direction of away .
( applause )
they think of buildings and streets and skyscrapers , noisy cabs .
so i believe that lively , enjoyable public spaces are the key to planning a great city .
what attracts people to successful public spaces , and what is it about unsuccessful places that keeps people away ?
but one of the more wonky things about me is that i am an animal behaviorist , and i use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces .
this little space became a small phenomenon , and because it had such a profound impact on new yorkers , it made an enormous impression on me .
but what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it ?
well , i would sit in the park and watch very carefully , and first among other things were the comfortable , movable chairs .
this little park provided what new yorkers crave : comfort and greenery .
unfortunately , that 's not how cities were being designed .
so here you see a familiar sight .
this is how plazas have been designed for generations .
they have that stylish , spartan look that we often associate with modern architecture , but it 's not surprising that people avoid spaces like this .
i mean , where would you sit here ?
what would you do here ?
they might tolerate a sculpture or two , but that 's about it .
there 's nothing to water , nothing to maintain , and no undesirable people to worry about .
but do n't you think this is a waste ?
for me , becoming a city planner meant being able to truly change the city that i lived in and loved .
as i learned from my stepfather , they certainly do not happen by accident , especially in a city like new york , where public space has to be fought for to begin with , and then for them to be successful , somebody has to think very hard about every detail .
the first opportunity i had to fight for a great public open space was in the early 1980s , when i was leading a team of planners at a gigantic landfill called battery park city in lower manhattan on the hudson river .
so we came up with a radical , almost insane idea .
so we only could afford to build a two-block section of what would become a mile-long esplanade , so whatever we built had to be perfect .
so you see , details really do make a difference .
in this photo , everything looks very finished , but that granite edge , those lights , the back on that bench , the trees in planting , and the many different kinds of places to sit were all little battles that turned this project into a place that people wanted to be .
now , this proved very valuable 20 years later when michael bloomberg asked me to be his planning commissioner and put me in charge of shaping the entire city of new york .
how were we going to find housing for that many new new yorkers ?
our city could n't possibly handle any more cars .
if we were to channel and redirect all new development around transit , we could actually handle that population increase , we thought .
so how was i going to get this done ?
by listening . so i began listening , in fact , thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust .
it 's not something you can just fake .
i ca n't tell you how many blocks i walked , in sweltering summers , in freezing winters , year after year , just so i could get to understand the dna of each neighborhood and know what each street felt like .
over the course of 12 years , we were able to rezone 124 neighborhoods , 40 percent of the city , 12,500 blocks , so that now , 90 percent of all new development of new york is within a 10-minute walk of a subway .
my mission was always to create great public spaces .
here you see what was two miles of abandoned , degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of greenpoint and williamsburg in brooklyn , impossible to get to and impossible to use .
honestly , i had no idea how it would turn out .
i had to have faith .
but i put everything that i had studied and learned into those plans .
and then it opened , and i have to tell you , it was incredible .
and here is a new park in lower manhattan .
and after 9/11 , the city had very little control .
but i thought if we went to the lower manhattan development corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower manhattan .
and it did .
lower manhattan finally has a public waterfront on all three sides .
you know , railings have to be higher now , so we put bar seating at the edge , and you can get so close to the water you 're practically on it .
`` and i love when people come there and look up and they say , `` wow , there 's brooklyn , and it 's so close . '' ''
how do you turn a park into a place that people want to be ?
well , it 's up to you , not as a city planner but as a human being .
i mean , would you want to go there ?
would you want to stay there ?
so now i 'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park called the high line .
the high line was an elevated railway .
( applause ) the high line was an elevated railway that ran through three neighborhoods on manhattan 's west side , and when the train stopped running , it became a self-seeded landscape , a kind of a garden in the sky .
and the high line , even though it is widely known now and phenomenally popular , it is the most contested public space in the city .
you know , it 's true , commercial interests will always battle against public space .
hey , why not take out those plantings and have shops all along the high line ?
would n't that be terrific and wo n't it mean a lot more money for the city ?
well no , it would not be terrific .
most recently , the last section of the high line , the third section of the high line , the final section of the high line , has been pitted against development interests , where some of the city 's leading developers are building more than 17 million square feet at the hudson yards .
`` and they came to me and proposed that they `` '' temporarily disassemble '' '' that third and final section . ''
perhaps the high line did n't fit in with their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers on a hill .
but in any case , it took nine months of nonstop daily negotiation to finally get the signed agreement to prohibit its demolition , and that was only two years ago .
public space can change how you live in a city , how you feel about a city , whether you choose one city over another , and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
so they brought out their cannons .
i was about 10 years old on a camping trip with my dad in the adirondack mountains , a wilderness area in the northern part of new york state .
it was a beautiful day .
it was a lean-to on a bluff looking over a crystal , beautiful lake , when i discovered a horror .
who cleans up after us ?
however you configure or wherever you place the us , who cleans up after us in istanbul ?
here in new york , the department of sanitation cleans up after us , to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day .
i wanted to get to know them as individuals .
what 's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden ?
so i started a research project with them .
i rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city , and i learned a lot , but i was still an outsider .
i did n't just ride in the trucks now . i drove the trucks .
everyone asks about the smell .
the weight takes a long time to get used to .
then there 's the danger .
you 're in and out of traffic all day , and it 's zooming around you .
it never stops coming .
it 's also like a form of respiration or circulation .
and then there 's the stigma .
the economy needs them .
if we ca n't throw out the old stuff , we have no room for the new stuff , so then the engines of the economy start to sputter when consumption is compromised .
and then there 's what i call our average , necessary quotidian velocity .
by that i simply mean how fast we 're used to moving in the contemporary day and age .
we usually do n't care for , repair , clean , carry around our coffee cup , our shopping bag , our bottle of water .
we use them , we throw them out , we forget about them , because we know there 's a workforce on the other side that 's going to take it all away .
their work , i think , is kind of liturgical .
they wear a uniform in many cities .
you know when to expect them .
and their work lets us do our work .
the flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves , from our own dross , our cast-offs , and that flow must be maintained always no matter what .
and i tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days , but i started to cry .
his name is paulie , and we worked together many times , and we became good friends .
we are going to be okay .
municipal waste , what we think of when we talk about garbage , accounts for three percent of the nation 's waste stream .
( applause )
seventy-thousand years ago , our ancestors were insignificant animals .
today , in contrast , we control this planet .
usually , we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level .
and if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island , and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better , i would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee , not on myself .
one versus one , or even 10 versus 10 , chimpanzees might be better than us .
but , if you pit 1,000 humans against 1,000 chimpanzees , the humans will win easily , for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees can not cooperate at all .
i do n't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras , which are recording what i 'm saying .
i do n't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that i read in preparation for this talk .
we can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers , because we alone , of all the animals on the planet , can create and believe fictions , fictional stories .
all other animals use their communication system only to describe reality .
`` a chimpanzee may say , `` '' look ! there 's a lion , let 's run away ! '' '' or , `` '' look ! there 's a banana tree over there ! let 's go and get bananas ! '' '' humans , in contrast , use their language not merely to describe reality , but also to create new realities , fictional realities . ''
`` a human can say , `` '' look , there is a god above the clouds ! ''
the same is true of the political field .
the most important factors in modern politics are states and nations .
a mountain is an objective reality .
they are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers .
yet , what is money ?
this is something amazing .
he was quite fond of them , actually .
i 'm going to talk to you about power in this 21st century .
and basically , what i 'd like to tell you is that power is changing , and there are two types of changes i want to discuss .
and there the simple version of the message is it 's moving from west to east .
the other is power diffusion , the way power is moving from all states west or east to non-state actors .
those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century .
and i want to tell you about them each separately and then how they interact and why , in the end , there may be some good news .
to understand power diffusion put this in your mind : computing and communications costs have fallen a thousandfold between 1970 and the beginning of this century .
now that 's a big abstract number .
but to make it more real , if the price of an automobile had fallen as rapidly as the price of computing power , you could buy a car today for five dollars .
now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically , the barriers to entry go down .
anybody can play in the game .
so in 1970 , if you wanted to communicate from oxford to johannesburg to new delhi to brasilia and anywhere simultaneously , you could do it .
now , anybody has that capacity , which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors .
and what that means is not that the age of the state is over .
but the stage is crowded .
the state 's not alone . there are many , many actors .
some of that 's good : oxfam , a great non-governmental actor .
you might think of that as the privatization of war .
so we 're seeing a great change in terms of diffusion of power .
now the problem is that we 're not thinking about it in very innovative ways .
`` you can do it with threats of coercion , `` '' sticks , '' '' you can do it with payments , `` carrots , '' or you can do it by getting others to want what you want . ''
and that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what i call soft power .
traditionally , the way people thought about power was primarily in terms of military power .
but we need a new narrative if we 're to understand power in the 21st century .
it 's not just prevailing at war , though war still persists .
and we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective .
and the current narrative is all about the rise of china and the decline of the united states .
the tectonic plates of world politics were shifting .
but in fact , this metaphor of decline is often very misleading .
`` in 1958 , after the soviets put up sputnik , it was `` '' that 's the end of america . '' '' in 1973 , with the oil embargo and the closing of the gold window , that was the end of america . ''
but in fact , what we 've seen is none of those were true .
indeed , people were over-enthusiastic in the early 2000s , thinking america could do anything , which led us into some disastrous foreign policy adventures , and now we 're back to decline again .
the moral of this story is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline tell us a lot more about psychology than they do about reality .
so we 've got , what , 17 more years to go or so before china 's bigger .
but be very careful about these projections such as the goldman sachs projection as though that gives you an accurate picture of power transition in this century .
let me mention three reasons why it 's too simple .
first of all , it 's a linear projection .
you know , everything says , here 's the growth rate of china , here 's the growth rate of the u.s. , here it goes — straight line .
history is not linear .
there are often bumps along the road , accidents along the way .
the other point that 's worth noticing is how one-dimensional this projection is .
you know , it looks at economic power measured by gdp .
and also , when we think about the rise of asia , or return of asia as i called it a little bit earlier , it 's worth remembering asia 's not one thing .
it 's as though mexico and canada were hostile neighbors to the united states , which they 're not .
so these simple projections of the goldman sachs type are not telling us what we need to know about power transition .
the peloponnesian war was the great conflict in which the greek city state system tore itself apart two and a half millennia ago .
what caused it ?
many people argue that the 21st century is going to repeat the 20th century , in which world war one , the great conflagration in which the european state system tore itself apart and destroyed its centrality in the world , that that was caused by the rise in the power of germany and the fear it created in britain .
so there are people who are telling us this is going to be reproduced today , that what we 're going to see is the same thing now in this century .
no , i think that 's wrong .
but also , if you have this belief and it creates a sense of fear , it leads to overreaction .
and the greatest danger we have of managing this power transition of the shift toward the east is fear .
and if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective , we 're going to be able to manage this process .
if you ask how is power distributed in the world today , it 's distributed much like a three-dimensional chess game .
the united states is the only superpower , and it 's likely to remain that way for two or three decades .
there are balancers — the u.s. , europe , china , japan can balance each other .
power is chaotically distributed .
and the only way you can solve these problems — and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century — is through cooperation , through working together , which means that soft power becomes more important , that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation .
if china develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions , that 's good for us as well as good for china as well as good for everybody else .
so empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody , and it 's not a zero sum , i win , you lose .
now i do n't mean to be pollyannaish about this .
wars persist . power persists .
keeping balances is important .
all this still persists .
hard power is there , and it will remain .
so the key question that we need to think about as we look at this is how do we work together to produce global public goods , things from which all of us can benefit ?
in that sense , if we define our interests , for example , for the united states the way britain defined its interests in the 19th century , keeping an open trading system , keeping a monetary stability , keeping freedom of the seas — those were good for britain , they were good for others as well .
and in the 21st century , you have to do an analog to that .
how do we produce global public goods , which are good for us , but good for everyone at the same time ?
and that 's going to be the good news dimension of what we need to think about as we think of power in the 21st century .
in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power .
thank you very much .
the same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart .
in the early 2000s , arabs were flooding the web .
at the time , when i logged into social media , i started seeing more and more egyptians aspiring for political change in the country .
it felt like i was not alone .
his name was khaled said .
we worked together for hours and hours .
it had more fans than established media organizations and even top celebrities .
`` egyptians on social media were wondering , `` if tunisia did it , why ca n't we ? '' ''
`` i posed a question to the 300,000 users of the page at the time : `` '' today is the 14th of january . ''
the 25th of january is police day .
it 's a national holiday .
social media was crucial for this campaign .
and it made it impossible for the regime to stop it .
at the time , they did n't even understand it .
then came the consequences .
`` i had just tweeted , `` '' pray for egypt . ''
one covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me .
my online world became a battleground filled with trolls , lies , hate speech .
but of course , this was n't just about me .
it was a moment of defeat .
i stayed silent for more than two years , and i used the time to reflect on everything that happened , trying to understand why did it happen .
second , we create our own echo chambers .
these are conversations that matter .
so i want to tell you a story — an encouraging story — about addressing desperation , depression and despair in afghanistan , and what we have learned from it , and how to help people to overcome traumatic experiences and how to help them to regain some confidence in the time ahead — in the future — and how to participate again in everyday life .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
and people had hope , yes , but until they realized their situation worsens every day — either because they are being killed or because , somehow , they are poorer than eight years ago .
`` one day a man told me , `` '' my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . '' '' this is a picture i took in 2005 , walking on fridays over the hills in kabul , and for me it 's a symbolic picture of an open future for a young generation . ''
so , doctors prescribe medication .
and donors are supposed to bring peace by building schools and roads .
military collect weapons , and depression stays intact .
so , soon after my arrival , i had confirmed something which i had already known ; that my instruments come from the heart of modern europe , yes .
however , what can wound us and our reaction to those wounds — they are universal .
and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context .
and if people feel used , worthless and ashamed , because something horrible has happened to them , then they retreat , and they fall into social isolation , and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones , because they do not want to burden them .
and very often violence is a way to cope with it .
to compensate this loss of inner control , they try to control the outside , very understandably — mostly the family — and unfortunately , this fits very well into the traditional side , regressive side , repressive side , restrictive side of the cultural context .
the desperate try to restore order and normality , and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence , it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt .
so everybody needs a sense for the future , and the afghan sense of the future is shattered .
somebody has to be a witness to what has happened to you .
somebody has to feel how you felt .
and somebody has to see you and listen to you .
everybody must be able to know what he or she has experienced is true , and this only goes with another person .
`` so everybody must be able to say , `` '' this happened to me , and it did this with me , but i 'm able to live with it , to cope with it , and to learn from it . ''
`` and i want to engage myself in the bright future for my children and the children of my children , and i will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter , '' '' — what happens too often in afghanistan . ''
but , of course , i needed help and funds .
this was our sign — it 's hand-painted , and we had 45 all over kabul .
and 70 percent regained their lives .
and they are working with me up to today .
we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho-social care and psycho-social counselors to the system .
and the red line is the treatment as usual — medication with a medical doctor .
and all the symptoms stayed the same or even got worse .
and you can see the symptoms almost completely go away , and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly , which is explicable , because you can not take away the psycho-social stresses , but you can learn how to cope with them .
so here you see , this is a health facility in northern afghanistan , and every morning it looks like this all over .
and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
`` and now you are helping me to regain some confidence in the future . '' '' and another counselor said to me after the training , `` '' you know , i never knew why i survived the killings in my village , but now i know , because i am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in afghanistan . '' '' so i believe this kept me running . ''
and this is a really emancipatory and political contribution to peace and reconciliation .
and also — i think — without psycho-social therapy , and without considering this in all humanitarian projects , we can not build-up civil societies .
i thank you for your attention .
( applause )
specifically , i make technologies to help them communicate .
and when you get to language , you see that it becomes a word whose look , the way it looks and the way it sounds , has absolutely nothing to do with what it started with , or what it represents , which is the bowl of soup .
so it 's essentially a completely abstract , a completely arbitrary representation of something which is in the real world , and this is something that children with autism have an incredible amount of difficulty with .
`` so if a child with autism wanted to say , `` '' i want soup , '' '' that child would pick three different pictures , `` '' i , '' '' `` '' want , '' '' and `` '' soup , '' '' and they would put these together , and then the therapist or the parent would understand that this is what the kid wants to say . ''
and this has been incredibly effective ; for the last 30 , 40 years people have been doing this .
there are thousands of children using this , you know , all over the world , and i started thinking about what it does and what it does n't do .
and i realized something interesting : avaz helps children with autism learn words .
what it does n't help them do is to learn word patterns .
let me explain this in a little more detail .
`` take this sentence : `` '' i want soup tonight . '' '' now it 's not just the words here that convey the meaning . ''
now , this is what we call grammar .
the solution came to me from a very interesting perspective .
`` so she asked , `` '' eat what ? do you want to eat ice cream ? ''
and so if you do this , then what you 're conveying is not a sentence in english , but what you 're conveying is really a meaning , the meaning of a sentence in english .
now , meaning is really the underbelly , in some sense , of language .
it 's what comes after thought but before language .
`` this is not enough because if you wanted to convey something like negation , you want to say , `` '' i do n't want soup , '' '' then you ca n't do that by asking a question . ''
`` you do that by changing the word `` '' want . '' '' again , if you wanted to say , `` i wanted soup yesterday , '' you do that by converting the word `` '' want '' '' into `` '' wanted . '' '' it 's a past tense . ''
so this is a flourish which i added to make the system complete .
let me show you this with a different example .
`` let 's take this sentence : `` i told the carpenter i could not pay him . '' ''
it 's a fairly complicated sentence .
`` i 'm going to start with the word `` '' tell . '' '' so this is the word `` '' tell . '' '' now this happened in the past , so i 'm going to make that `` '' told . '' '' now , what i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to ask questions . ''
so , who told ? i told .
`` we start with the word `` '' pay , '' '' and we add the ability filter to it to make it `` '' can pay . '' '' then we make it `` '' ca n't pay , '' '' and we can make it `` '' could n't pay '' '' by making it the past tense . ''
so who could n't pay ? i could n't pay .
and then you join these two together by asking this question : what did i tell the carpenter ?
i told the carpenter i could not pay him .
and there are two or three interesting things about this .
`` i did n't have to start with the word `` '' tell . '' '' i could have started anywhere in the sentence , and i could have made this entire thing . ''
the second thing is , if i was n't an english speaker , if i was speaking in some other language , this map would actually hold true in any language .
so long as the questions are standardized , the map is actually independent of language .
so i call this freespeech , and i was playing with this for many , many months .
i was trying out so many different combinations of this .
i was trying to convert language , convert sentences in english into sentences in freespeech , and vice versa , and back and forth .
and i realized that this particular configuration , this particular way of representing language , it allowed me to actually create very concise rules that go between freespeech on one side and english on the other .
so i could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into english .
i developed this thing called the freespeech engine which takes any freespeech sentence as the input and gives out perfectly grammatical english text .
so i tried this out with kids with autism , and i found that there was an incredible amount of identification .
so what 's interesting about freespeech is that when you create a sentence or when you create language , a child with autism creates language with freespeech , they 're not using this support language , they 're not using this bridge language .
is it possible to use freespeech not for children with autism but to teach language to people without disabilities ?
the first thing i did was i built a jigsaw puzzle in which these questions and answers are coded in the form of shapes , in the form of colors , and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works .
and i built an app out of it , a game out of it , in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement , a sound reinforcement of visual structures , they 're able to learn language .
all right , let 's talk about something else .
so speech is the primary mode of communication delivered between all of us .
our mouths are built to create one-dimensional sound .
i mean , we have these rich , complicated , multi-dimensional ideas .
now what 's interesting is that we do a lot of work in information nowadays , and almost all of that is done in the language domain .
take google , for example .
google trawls all these countless billions of websites , all of which are in english , and when you want to use google , you go into google search , and you type in english , and it matches the english with the english .
what if we could do this in freespeech instead ?
instead they 're processing the data structure of thought .
we have the free speech representation on one side , and we have the freespeech engine , which generates english .
it does n't have any specific information in it which is about english .
so everything that this system knows about english is actually encoded into the engine .
you 've encoded an entire human language into a software program .
it 's not very complicated code .
and what 's more interesting is the fact that the vast majority of the code in that engine is not really english-specific .
it might be very easy for us to actually create these engines in many , many different languages , in hindi , in french , in german , in swahili .
and that gives another interesting idea .
we have so many different languages .
i think it 's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented .
it entertains , it educates , it enlightens , but what i like the most about language is that it empowers .
i want to leave you with this .
the girl 's name is pavna , and that 's her mother , kalpana .
she has quadriplegic cerebral palsy , so ever since she was born , she could neither move nor talk .
and everything that she 's accomplished so far , finishing school , going to college , starting a company , collaborating with me to develop avaz , all of these things she 's done with nothing more than moving her eyes .
that 's my only real aim in life .
and i 'm being told the dynamic .
however , that is simply not enough .
if i just simply let go and allow my hand , my arm , to be more of a support system , suddenly i have more dynamic with less effort . much more .
not just translate them , but interpret them .
he would have the sound coming through the resonators .
but it 's not only about the front page .
and design is responsible for this experience .
give power to designers .
thank you .
about a dozen officers then gathered near us .
`` middle eastern male with a backpack . '' '' and this description carried on into their police reports . ''
`` i never expected to be described by my own government in these terms : `` lurking , '' `` nefarious , '' `` terrorist . '' ''
raise your hand .
that 's illegal under federal law .
one of our cases is against ferguson , missouri .
ferguson was issuing an average of over two arrest warrants , per person , per year , mostly for unpaid debt to the courts .
and he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond , and when they came , the man was unconscious .
so they called the paramedics and the paramedics went to the cell .
this is related to the lack of mental health care in our jails .
i met a woman , single mother of three , making seven dollars an hour .
she does n't have access to those medications in ferguson 's jail , because no one has access to their medications .
it 's an ordinary government building .
what i have in mind is our policy of bail .
we draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it .
so it 's a big design job , but we 'll see about how things are going on .
it 's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on .
so the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around .
so again , you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here .
what 's the kind of technique ?
so i 'll show you the next movie .
notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern .
so we live in the boonies .
a parsec is 3.26 light years .
so a gigaparsec is three billion light years — that 's the scale .
that 's the distance between us and andromeda , right ?
and so you know when you first saw this picture , it did n't mean quite so much to you .
at the beginning it 's very uniform .
thank you .
what is it made of ?
and i wo n't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it 's like , and so on .
now , sometimes those probabilities are near certainties .
coulomb , in france , found the same law for electric charges .
now , here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of .
and it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force .
famine had hit my country of zimbabwe , and we just did n't have enough to eat .
and that 's when the girl in the blue uniform came to my village with the united nations to feed the children .
`` as she handed me my porridge , i asked her why she was there , and without hesitation , she said , `` as africans , we must uplift all the people of africa . '' ''
two years later , famine hit my country for the second time .
so at the age of 10 , i found myself in school for the very first time .
and there , at the city school , i would experience what it was to be unequal .
i could n't speak english , and i was way behind in terms of reading and writing .
and in their eyes , i was no longer their equal .
i felt guilty .
the initiative is based on a simple idea : that what we share is much more powerful than what divides us .
now imagine that women are represented here , and men are represented here .
why invite men ? they are the problem .
but something incredible happened when we launched heforshe .
`` we heard from a man out of zimbabwe , who , after hearing about heforshe , created a `` '' husband school . '' '' ( laughter ) he literally went around his village , hand-picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners , and committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers . ''
in pune , india , a youth advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally , mobilizing 700 cyclists to share the heforshe messages within their own community .
madam , it has been two weeks , and the woman has not cried since .
we are calling upon governments , businesses , universities , to change their policies .
already , a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up and made some concrete heforshe commitments .
in fact , one in 20 men in iceland has joined the movement .
now this is the beginning of the vision that heforshe has for the world that we want to see .
this delusion is a kind of prison for us ...
heforshe is tapping into women 's and men 's dreams , the dreams that we have for ourselves , and the dreams that we have for our families , our children , friends , communities .
so that 's what it is about .
( applause )
`` i 'm going to have to give you another pill . '' '' so now we 're talking about two medications . ''
this pill also — millions of people have taken it , the company did studies , the fda looked at it — all good .
`` `` '' but nick , there 's a problem . ''
but we were nervous .
for example , that 's how we can make the quad hover .
we 've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured .
hexacopters and octocopters , with six and eight propellers , can provide redundancy , but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs : four .
mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible .
will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry ?
will the vaulter stick the landing ?
notice that , at full extension , these quads are vertical .
take this quad , for example .
once we know this force , we can also change the laws of physics , as far as the quad is concerned , of course .
before making my own mother 's day card , i thought i would take a look at the scratch website .
`` so in the search box i typed in `` mother 's day , '' and i was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of mother 's day cards that showed up on the scratch website , many of them just in the past 24 hours by procrastinators just like myself . ''
so i started taking a look at them . ( music ) i saw one of them that featured a kitten and her mom and wishing her mom a happy mother 's day .
( typing ) and then once she found out when mother 's day was happening , she delivered a special mother 's day greeting of how much she loved her mom .
in fact , i liked it so much that , instead of making my own project , i sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects . ( laughter ) and actually , she reacted exactly the way that i hoped that she would .
when you become fluent with language , it means you can write an entry in your journal or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend .
now maybe you wo n't be so surprised by this , because a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology .
i 'm not so sure we should be thinking of young people as digital natives .
you often see them in situations like this , or like this , and there 's no doubt that young people are very comfortable and familiar browsing and chatting and texting and gaming .
so young people today have lots of experience and lots of familiarity with interacting with new technologies , but a lot less so of creating with new technologies and expressing themselves with new technologies .
and i 'm really interested in seeing , how can we help young people become fluent so they can write with new technologies ?
you know , in recent years , there have been hundreds of new organizations and websites that are helping young people learn to code .
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
and that triggered a debate in the u.k .
now , for some of you , when you hear about this , it might seem sort of strange about everybody learning to code .
when many people think of coding , they think of it as something that only a very narrow sub-community of people are going to be doing , and they think of coding looking like this .
and in fact , if this is what coding is like , it will only be a narrow sub-community of people with special mathematical skills and technological background that can code .
but coding does n't have to be like this .
so in scratch , to code , you just snap blocks together .
in this case , you take a move block , snap it into a stack , and the stacks of blocks control the behaviors of the different characters in your game or your story , in this case controlling the big fish .
so , of course , making a fish game is n't the only thing you can do with scratch .
and it does n't just stay on the screen .
you can also code to interact with the physical world around you .
and as i move my hand , i can pop the balloons or i can move the bug .
so it 's a little bit like microsoft kinect , where you interact with gestures in the world .
`` but instead of just playing someone else 's game , you get to create the games , and if you see someone else 's game , you can just say `` '' see inside , '' '' and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it . ''
( crickets chirping ) ( shouts ) ( chomping ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) as kids are creating projects like this , they 're learning to code , but even more importantly , they 're coding to learn .
because as they learn to code , it enables them to learn many other things , opens up many new opportunities for learning .
again , it 's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing .
when you learn to read , you can then read to learn .
and it 's the same thing with coding .
you learn more about how computers work .
let me show you an example .
these are after-school learning centers that we helped start that help young people from low-income communities learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies .
and when i went to one of the clubhouses a couple years ago , i saw a 13-year-old boy who was using our scratch software to create a game somewhat like this one , and he was very happy with his game and proud of his game , but also he wanted to do more .
in scratch , you can create something called a variable .
`` and that creates some new blocks for you , and also creates a little scoreboard that keeps track of the score , so each time i click on `` '' change score , '' '' it increments the score . ''
so i showed this to the clubhouse member — let 's call him victor — and victor , when he saw that this block would let him increment the score , he knew exactly what to do .
he took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish .
so then , each time the big fish eats the little fish , he will increment the score , and the score will go up by one .
and it 's in fact working .
it 's nothing that , really , they can make use of .
they 're relevant for all sorts of different activities .
now , who knows if victor is going to grow up and become a programmer or a professional computer scientist ?
again , it 's useful to think about this analogy with language .
but it 's useful for everybody to learn how to read and write .
again , the same thing with coding .
most people wo n't grow up to become professional computer scientists or programmers , but those skills of thinking creatively , reasoning systematically , working collaboratively — skills you develop when you code in scratch — are things that people can use no matter what they 're doing in their work lives .
let me end with just one more example .
so she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday scratch card .
but working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity and developing new ways of expressing herself .
so as we take a look and we see that michael bloomberg is learning to code , all of the children of estonia learn to code , even my mom has learned to code , do n't you think it 's about time that you might be thinking about learning to code ?
if you 're interested in giving it a try , i 'd encourage you to go to the scratch website .
it 's scratch.mit.edu , and give a try at coding .
and this has come onto the stage pretty recently .
volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .
the ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
this is the ship that i spent the last three months on in the antarctic .
this was — this is south of the antarctic circle .
this was completely unexpected .
then there was similar mortality in '97-'98 .
here 's how we sample the corals .
this coral is eight meters tall , right .
and it been growing for about 600 years .
you can see some of the coral cores there on the right .
and of course , our thermometers only take us back 50 years or so here .
this is as messy as it gets .
do you see where i 'm going with this ?
and i wanted to show the number .
a strange phenomenon .
to do so , she had to elude every big institution in her life : repressive governments , occupying armies and even armed border patrols .
instead of running away from big institutions , i 've actually run toward them .
so why do we do these things ?
one fish is just one fish in the sea .
so , in my bag i have a coffee mug that i bought a couple of years ago .
it 's a reusable mug . it has all these things printed on it .
look at some of the things that are on it , that it says .
`` `` this one cup can be used again and again . '' ''
`` `` this one cup may inspire others to use one too . '' ''
do you remember the grimm 's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot ?
we believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command : make more money .
so we asked people , what do you really think ?
so is it true ?
well , you know , the investors in companies like burt 's bees or ben & jerry 's would n't say so .
the serious companies that fund our economy and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round , they need to stick to making more money .
almost twice as much sweet porridge .
now , let 's be clear , they did n't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen .
now , harvard 's not alone .
far from making less sweet porridge because he added sustainability into the mix , he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark .
so here 's why i 'm convinced that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing the new normal .
we just need to let go of that myth that if you add your values into your investment thinking , that you get less sweet porridge .
it now represents one out of every six dollars under professional management in the united states .
so what are we waiting for ?
she was passionate about that goal and she was clear that she would let no army , no obstacle , no big institution stand in her way .
passionate clarity : that 's what i think we need to drive change .
passion about the change we want to see in the world , and clarity that we are able to help chart the course .
vote with your small change .
change the fables and change the markets .

white people own time .
i know , i know .
how will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race ?
but we treat time as though it is timeless , as though it has always been this way , as though it does n't have a political history bound up with the plunder of indigenous lands , the genocide of indigenous people and the stealing of africans from their homeland .
this idea , that black people have had no impact on history , is one of the foundational ideas of white supremacy .
`` it 's the reason that carter g. woodson created `` '' negro history week '' '' in 1926 . ''
why ca n't you move on ?
we have a black president .
`` we 're past all that . '' '' william faulkner famously said , `` '' the past is never dead . ''
we do n't have the luxury of letting go of the past .
but still , let us press our way into the present .
at present , i would argue that the racial struggles we are experiencing are clashes over time and space .
what do i mean ?
well , i 've already told you that white people own time .
those in power dictate the pace of the workday .
they dictate how much money our time is actually worth .
let me loop back to the past quickly to give you an example .
but another place that we see these time-space clashes is in gentrifying cities like atlanta , brooklyn , philadelphia , new orleans and washington , dc — places that have had black populations for generations .
but when hegel famously said that africa was no historical part of the world , he implied that it was merely a voluminous land mass taking up space at the bottom of the globe .
what if your group is the group for whom a future was never imagined ?
so if we 're really ready to talk about the future , perhaps we should begin by admitting that we 're out of time .
we black people have always been out of time .
but first , we have to decide that time belongs to all of us .
i believe the future is what we make it .
it 's our time .
ours .
in fact , 15 exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself .
growing up , i had a nickname .
in my childhood , they taught me silence .
in sunday school , they taught me do n't confront , do n't argue , even if you 're right , turn the other cheek .
kenya 's poor are five times more likely to be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them than by criminals .
we had a president , moi , who was a dictator .
he ruled the country with an iron fist , and anyone who dared question his authority was arrested , tortured , jailed or even killed .
being a coward was not an insult .
being a coward was a compliment .
we used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother .
what that meant : that if you stayed out of trouble you 're going to stay alive .
what followed that election was terrible violence , rape , and the killing of over 1,000 people .
we pretended . we all became smart cowards .
we decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about it .
my friends did not show up .
my friends and family thought i was crazy because of what i did , and the images that i took were disturbing my life .
most kenyans did not see the violence .
and so i decided to actually start a street exhibition to show the images of the violence across the country and get people talking about it .
it has been done in uganda and other countries , and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country , across the continent .
where i used to stand up alone seven years ago , now i belong to a community of many people who stand up with me .
i am no longer alone when i stand up to speak about these things .
so that was my story .
by that one action , i said goodbye to the 24 years living as a coward .
there are two most powerful days in your life : the day you 're born , and the day you discover why .
do you know why you were born ?
thank you .
so pawa254 : you 've created a studio , a place where young people can go and harness the power of digital media to do some of this action .
can i say one more thing ?
there 's nothing as powerful as that , knowing that i 'm meant to do this , because you do n't get scared , you just continue living your life .
and it 's an escalating problem too .
and that 's going to pose an enormous problem .
as we 're moving into cities , the world is also embracing a western diet .
it used to be a social event , buying and selling food .
we just read the back of a label on a packet .
it can either mean a good place , or no place .
well i think it looks a bit like this .
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
it 's almost like a 3d photograph .
because i always think meaning does n't really exist .
so the lamp is not just giving a light , it 's also giving a darkness .
is there any way to capture the thought into visual art ?
you buy this for 3,000 rupees , it 'll become 30,000 in two months .
we see where it 's bouncing , but we do n't see [ them ] as they exist .
then i thought , okay , let me sculpt that .
yes , you can , and i 'll show you in a second how to do that .
now , here 's how you do the battery and the bulb .
so , children are not empty vessels , ok ?
now you get it .
as a magician , i 'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion .
his name was nikola , nikola tesla .
now the baby grew into a very smart guy .
let me show you .
nikola tesla : the result is 118,236 .
marco tempest : now tesla 's brain worked in the most extraordinary way .
when a word was mentioned , an image of it instantly appeared in his mind .
tree . chair . girl .
they were hallucinations , which vanished the moment he touched them .
probably a form of synesthesia .
but it was something he later turned to his advantage .
mt : and when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination , he would build them in his workshop .
nt : i needed no models , drawings or experiments .
i could picture them as real in my mind , and there i run it , test it and improve it .
only then do i construct it .
mt : his great idea was alternating current .
but how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe ?
nt : we are at the dawn of a new age , the age of electricity .
it is the magic of science .
but the high point was the realization of a childhood dream : harnessing the raging powers of niagara falls , and bringing light to the city .
but tesla 's success did n't last .
illuminating the city was only the beginning .
nt : they would n't give me the money .
mt : well , maybe you should n't have told them it could be used to contact other planets .
he became a recluse .
dodged by death , he spent much of his time in his suite at the waldorf-astoria .
nt : everything i did , i did for mankind , for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich , where products of intellect , science and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life .
tesla 's insight was profound .
nt : tell me , what will man do when the forests disappear , and the coal deposits are exhausted ?
mt : tesla thought he had the answer .
we are still asking the question .
( applause )
this is a six-story bespoke home on the island of bali .
and we 're not some tv survivor program .
i became very low .
to succeed at something is often harder than actually making it happen .
it 's a big challenge , and what is our response to it ?
we are going to do it .
and i 'll leave you with these words from goethe .
i 'm a man who 's trying to live from his heart , and so just before i get going , i wanted to tell you as a south african that one of the men who has inspired me most passed away a few hours ago .
and so this talk is going to be for him .
i grew up amongst those animals .
i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called londolozi game reserve .
now for as long as i can remember , my job has been to take people out into nature , and so i think it 's a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering .
africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories , and so what i have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories , stories about heroes of heart .
now my stories are not the stories that you 'll hear on the news , and while it 's true that africa is a harsh place , i also know it to be a place where people , animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world .
he had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration , and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status .
( laughter ) but it was a defining time for me as a young boy .
mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think , to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa : peace , reconciliation , harmony .
`` through this act of immense open-heartedness , he was to become the embodiment of what in south africa we call `` '' ubuntu . '' '' ubuntu : i am because of you . ''
or , people are not people without other people .
it 's not a new idea or value but it 's one that i certainly think at these times is worth building on .
in fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa , we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others .
you are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who i am .
he would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men i would ever meet .
solly grew up tending to his father 's cattle .
now , i can tell you , i do n't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle , but it makes for über-resourcefulness .
these were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well-being .
and it was an old track , but for fun he turned and he began to follow it , and i tell you , i could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a ph.d.-level tracker .
if you drove past solly somewhere out on the reserve , you look up in your rearview mirror , you 'd see he 'd stopped the car 20 , 50 meters down the road just in case you need help with something .
`` the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said , `` solly , you are pathologically helpful . '' ''
( laughter ) when i started professionally guiding people out into this environment , solly was my tracker .
we worked together as a team .
`` and the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your east coast , and they said to solly , on the side , they said , `` '' before we even go out to see lions and leopards , we want to see where you live . '' '' so we took them up to his house , and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when solly 's wife , who was learning english , was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying , `` '' hello , i love you . ''
it was a hot day , and we found ourselves down by the river .
because of the heat , i took my shoes off , and i rolled up my pants , and i walked into the water .
the water was clear running over sand , and we turned and we began to make our way upstream .
now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite .
wham ! it hits me by my right leg .
it pulls me . it turns . i throw my hand up . i 'm able to grab a branch .
it 's a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you , and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that .
( laughter ) solly on the bank sees that i 'm in trouble .
he turns . he begins to make his way to me .
the croc again continues to shake me .
it goes to bite me a second time .
the bone is cracked .
the meat is torn up .
i make an instant decision that i 'll never look at that again .
as i come out of the water , solly arrives at a deep section , a channel between us .
he comes straight into the channel .
he wades in to above his waist .
he gets to me . he grabs me .
he picks me and puts me on his shoulder .
he lays me down . he pulls his shirt off .
he wraps it around my leg , picks me up a second time , walks me to a vehicle , and he 's able to get me to medical attention .
in a more collective society , we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others .
danger is shared . pain is shared .
in fact , solly gave her the name elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the elvis the pelvis dance .
she arrived at our reserve from a reserve east of us on her migratory route .
when i first saw her , i thought she would be dead in a matter of days .
and we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track .
it looked like an inverted bracket , and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow , and then we would come around the corner , and there she would be with her herd .
and it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals .
and then one day we came across them at this small water hole .
she got visibly — ears came forward , she had a full go of it and halfway up , her legs gave way , and she fell backwards .
and it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant .
the next day i watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth , and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground .
what elvis and the herd taught me caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu , and i believe that in the cathedral of the wild , we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves reflected back at us .
if africa has a gift to share , it 's a gift of a more collective society .
but i just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts , because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session .
boyd varty : well thanks , pat .
he was the father of our nation and we 've got a road to walk in south africa .
and everything , they used to call it madiba magic .
you know , he used to go to a rugby match and we would win .
but i think that magic will be with us , and the important thing is that we carry what he stood for .
and so that 's what i 'm going to try and do , and that 's what people all over south africa are trying to do .
pm : and that 's what you 've done today . bv : oh , thank you .
i 'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature .
the bad news is that mother nature 's back office is n't working yet , so those invoices do n't get issued .
i began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest , but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature , and which does n't get priced by the markets .
a project called teeb was started in 2007 , and it was launched by a group of environment ministers of the g8+5 .
and their basic inspiration was a stern review of lord stern .
and the answer is : yeah , it can .
biodiversity , the living fabric of this planet , is not a gas .
and yet , we began .
and amongst our compiled results was the startling revelation that , in fact , we were losing natural capital — the benefits that flow from nature to us .
we were losing it at an extraordinary rate — in fact , of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth of natural capital .
it 's a massive store of carbon , it 's an amazing store of biodiversity , but what people do n't really know is this also is a rain factory .
because the northeastern trade winds , as they go over the amazonas , effectively gather the water vapor .
something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds , and eventually precipitates in the form of rain across the la plata basin .
and the answer is zilch , exactly zero .
economics has become the currency of policy .
no matter what level you look at , whether it 's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level , we see the same problem again and again .
so rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests at an ecosystem level .
at the species level , it 's been estimated that insect-based pollination , bees pollinating fruit and so on , is something like 190 billion dollars-worth .
but when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice ?
once again , most of that does n't get paid .
and that brings me to another aspect of this , which is , to whom should this get paid ?
that genetic material probably belonged , if it could belong to anyone , to a local community of poor people who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule , which then became the medicine .
a billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein .
and finally , at the ecosystem level , whether it 's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests , or whether it is the ability of poor farmers to go out and gather leaf litter for their cattle and goats , or whether it 's the ability of their wives to go and collect fuel wood from the forest , it is actually the poor who depend most on these ecosystem services .
we did estimates in our study that for countries like brazil , india and indonesia , even though ecosystem services — these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free — they 're not very big in percentage terms of gdp — two , four , eight , 10 , 15 percent — but in these countries , if we measure how much they 're worth to the poor , the answers are more like 45 percent , 75 percent , 90 percent .
that 's the difference .
because these are important benefits for the poor .
how bad can things get ?
it 's basically a measure of how many tigers , toads , ticks or whatever on average of biomass of various species are around .
the green represents the percentage .
and these are percentages versus the original state , so to speak , the pre-industrial era , 1750 .
and just watch the change in colors in india , china , europe , sub-saharan africa as we move on and consume global biomass at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us .
see that again .
but that does n't help because there were very few species and volume of biomass there in the first place .
the reason this is happening boils down , in my mind , to one basic problem , which is our inability to perceive the difference between public benefits and private profits .
so you compare the two sides of the coin and you find that it 's more like 1,200 to 600 .
once salt deposition and chemical deposition has had its effects , that answer is more like $ 12,000 of cost .
and if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries , the fish nurseries , that provide fish for the poor , that answer is more like $ 11,000 .
if you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits , you get a completely different answer , which is clearly conservation makes more sense , and not destruction .
this is not illegal stuff , this is basically business as usual , which causes climate-changing emissions , which have an economic cost .
use of freshwater .
basically the stuff of life is natural capital , and we need to recognize and build that into our systems .
when we measure corporate performances , we do n't include our impacts on nature and what our business costs society .
in fact , this was what really inspired my interest in this phase .
and a few friends of mine and i decided this does n't make sense .
this is going to create more cost to society and more losses .
so we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for india and its states .
that 's how my interests began and went to the teeb project .
calculating this at the national level is one thing , and it has begun .
but calculating this at the next level , that means at the business sector level , is important .
and actually we 've done this with the teeb project .
this is important , because in china in 1997 , the yellow river actually went dry for nine months causing severe loss of agriculture output and pain and loss to society .
so clearly there was a problem with deforestation .
it was associated largely with the construction industry .
the way to do this is to do it on a company basis , to take leadership forward , and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost , and to disclose these answers .
`` someone once asked me , `` '' who is better or worse , is it unilever or is it p & g when it comes to their impact on rainforests in indonesia ? '' '' and i could n't answer because neither of these companies , good though they are and professional though they are , do not calculate or disclose their externalities . ''
but if we look at companies like puma — jochen zeitz , their ceo and chairman , once challenged me at a function , saying that he 's going to implement my project before i finish it .
well i think we kind of did it at the same time , but he 's done it .
he 's basically worked the cost to puma .
puma has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover , 300 million dollars of profits , 200 million dollars after tax , 94 million dollars of externalities , cost to business .
today we ca n't yet do that , but i think the path is laid out .
has already set up a coalition to do this , an international coalition .
the other favorite , if you like , solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets .
teeb has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions including protected area evaluation and payments for ecosystem services and eco-certification and you name it , but these are the favorites .
today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace .
but that 's all about energy and industry .
but what we 're missing is also some other emissions like black carbon , that is soot .
what we 're also missing is blue carbon , which , by the way , is the largest store of carbon — more than 55 percent .
thankfully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
more of that in a minute .
green carbon , which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions , and blue carbon together comprise 25 percent of our emissions .
we have the means already in our hands , through a structure , through a mechanism , called redd plus — a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation .
and already norway has contributed a billion dollars each towards indonesia and brazil to implement this red plus scheme .
so we actually have some movement forward .
but the thing is to do a lot more of that .
as you can see , they cut across the entire globe all the way from micronesia across indonesia , malaysia , india , madagascar and to the west of the caribbean .
these red dots , these red areas , basically provide the food and livelihood for more than half a billion people .
let 's think about it and what it means , but please , let 's not do more of that .
i do n't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices .
thank you .
( applause )
so we all have our own biases .
there are 1 million such schools in india .
by the time kids are 13 or 14 , they tend to drop out of schools .
so basically , with that phone call , i promised to help a state and system which was as large as that of peru or canada transform itself .
there was no way we were going to be able to implement 50 things .
now the specifics of the goal do n't matter here , but what matters is how specific the goal is .
well , when we went inside schools , we found something completely different .
on most days , most teachers were actually inside schools .
but they were not teaching .
i went to another school where two of the teachers had gone to a nearby bank branch to deposit scholarship money into kids ' accounts .
when a supervisor comes to visit us , these are exactly the things that he checks .
has the toilet been made , has the meal been served .
so the government launched a whole host of programs to address these challenges , and the teachers became the implicit executors of these programs .
but what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled .
he does n't have the additional money , he does n't have the resources .
and hence , innovations do n't scale .
`` so right at the beginning of the project , what we said was , `` '' whatever we have to do has to be scalable , it has to work in all 15,000 schools . '' '' and hence , it has to work within the existing budgets and resources that the state actually has . ''
in the end , i think we did find solutions to many of the issues .
in the context of effective learning , one of the things people talk about is hands-on learning .
which basically means giving students things like beads , learning rods , abacuses .
one day , one of our team members went to a school and saw a teacher pick up sticks and stones from the garden outside and take them into the classroom and give them to the students .
now , this brings me to my last point .
however , what the teachers do have are smartphones .
so what now happens in haryana is , all principals and teachers are divided into hundreds of whatsapp groups and anytime something needs to be communicated , it 's just posted across all whatsapp groups .
you can immediately check who has received it , who has read it .
everybody 's acting as everybody 's peer group , and things are getting implemented .
so today , when you go to a school in haryana , things look different .
when a supervisor comes to visit the classroom , he or she not only checks the construction of the toilet but also what is the quality of teaching .
once a quarter , all students across the state are assessed on their learning outcomes and schools which are doing well are rewarded .
and schools which are not doing so well find themselves having difficult conversations .
but not in haryana .
learning levels of children have stopped declining , and they have started going up .
i think if you give them the right levers , they can move mountains .
they consulted with experts in conflict resolution .
why do n't you like this photo of yourself ?
the story starts in kenya in december of 2007 , when there was a disputed presidential election , and in the immediate aftermath of that election , there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .
and okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on .
`` and she quickly said , `` '' it 's too much . ''
i could do this all day every day and i ca n't keep up .
`` if only there was a way to automate this . '' '' and two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said , `` '' we could do that , '' '' and in 72 hours , they launched ushahidi . ''
that 's all it is , but that 's all that 's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population — everybody knows where the violence is , but no one person knows what everyone knows — and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it , and it maps it and it makes it public .
it 's since been deployed in mexico to track electoral fraud .
it 's been deployed in washington d.c. to track snow cleanup .
and it 's been used most famously in haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake .
now what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .
what okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity .
that is the resource that i 'm talking about .
and it represents the ability of the world 's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large , sometimes global , projects .
cognitive surplus is made up of two things .
the world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects .
the media landscape in the 20th century was very good at helping people consume , and we got , as a result , very good at consuming .
but now that we 've been given media tools — the internet , mobile phones — that let us do more than consume , what we 're seeing is that people were n't couch potatoes because we liked to be .
we still like to consume , of course .
but it turns out we also like to create , and we like to share .
and it 's those two things together — ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large-scale efforts — that are the new design resource .
and using cognitive surplus , we 're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific , literary , artistic , political efforts .
lolcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions .
and they are also part of the abundant media landscape we 're getting now .
now i want to stipulate , as the lawyers say , that lolcats are the stupidest possible creative act .
someone who has done something like this , however mediocre and throwaway , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
and once they 've done it , they can do it again , and they could work on getting it better .
there is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work , and as anybody who 's worked as an artist or a creator knows , it 's a spectrum you 're constantly struggling to get on top of .
the gap is between doing anything and doing nothing .
now it 's tempting to want to get the ushahidis without the lolcats , right , to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff .
but media abundance never works that way .
even with the sacred printing press , we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals .
so before i talk about what is , i think , the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi , i want to talk about their shared source .
and that source is design for generosity .
simple , straightforward , commonsensical — also , largely untested .
meanwhile , the parents — perhaps a little busy at work , running late , running errands — want a little slack to pick the kids up late .
so they divided the daycare centers into two groups .
the white group there is the control group ; they change nothing .
`` but the group of daycare centers represented by the black line , they said , `` '' we are changing this bargain as of right now . ''
late pick-ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average , and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre-fine average for the life of the fine .
and you can see immediately what happened , right ?
by adding a fine , what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of 10 shekels , and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers .
they were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones .
`` so gneezy and rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks — run the fine for a dozen weeks — and then they say , `` '' okay , that 's it . all done ; fine . '' '' and then a really interesting thing happens : nothing changes . ''
the culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed .
this brings me back to the lolcats and to ushahidi .
both of these rely on cognitive surplus .
both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share .
here is the critical difference between these : lolcats is communal value .
it 's value created by the participants for each other .
communal value on the networks we have is everywhere — every time you see a large aggregate of shared , publicly available data , whether it 's photos on flickr or videos on youtube or whatever .
it 's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole .
it really is going to be a side effect of what we , collectively , make of these kinds of efforts .
the number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow , and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead — a very different model than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century .
what 's going to make the difference here is what dean kamen said , the inventor and entrepreneur .
we 've got this trillion hours a year .
that , we get for free .
but we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value .
there is a total vacuum of creative capital in bertie county .
i thought violent jihad was noble , chivalrous and the best way to help .
jihad means to strive to one 's utmost .
the word jihad stands for all those meanings as a whole .
but now i believe that there are no circumstances on earth where violent jihad is permissible , because it will lead to greater harm .
but now the idea of jihad has been hijacked .
my father was an academic , and we were in the uk through his work .
i wanted to learn , but i could not go to school for four years .
i became a preacher .
i was one of the pioneers of violent jihad in the uk .
and i did this openly .
i did n't break any laws .
a victim of circumstance caught up in a war , cruelly thrust upon him by the cruel circumstances of the time .
one day i picked up this unexploded mortar shell in a trench , and i had it deposited in a makeshift mud hut lab .
so i started to question .
how did his death serve any purpose ?
why did he die and i lived ?
and the questions grew .
i met two 13-year-olds with soft manners and gentle voices .
they simply wanted to go to school — that was their dream .
not protecting anyone against invaders or occupiers ; not bringing relief to the oppressed .
so i got involved in violent jihad in the mid '80s , starting with afghanistan .
and by the time i finished it was in the year 2000 .
i was completely immersed in it .
and we did not give ourselves a chance to develop a virtuous character .
we told ourselves we were fighting for the oppressed , but these were unwinnable wars .
we became the very instrument through which more deaths occurred , complicit in causing further misery for the selfish benefit of the cruel few .
what have i learned ?
but i believe such people can change .
and we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cherish even for a single moment in their lives .
but now i began to question how i knew what i knew .
so i understood the vital importance of self-knowledge , political awareness and the necessity for a deep and wide understanding of our commitments and our actions , how they affect others .
that way we do matter more to ourselves ...
this is jihad — my true jihad .
roger ebert : these are my words , but this is not my voice .
for most of my life , i never gave a second thought to my ability to speak .
in those days , i was living in a fool 's paradise .
i used to be able to talk like that .
maybe i was n't as smart , but i was at least as talkative .
i want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself , and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one 's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away .
however , i 've found that listening to a computer voice for any great length of time can be monotonous .
so i 've decided to recruit some of my ted friends to read my words aloud for me .
going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in 2006 , i expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show , 'ebert and roeper at the movies . ' i had pre-taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation .
the doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw .
( laughter ) ( laughter ) ce : i was optimistic , and all was right with the world .
the first surgery was a great success .
i saw myself in the mirror and i looked pretty good .
i was using my ipod to play the leonard cohen song 'i 'm your man ' for my doctors and nurses .
my carotid artery had ruptured .
chaz told me that if that song had n't played for so long , i might have already been in the car , on the way home , and would have died right there and then .
( applause ) there was a second surgery — which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart .
and then a third attempt , which also patched me back together pretty well , until it failed .
a doctor from brazil said he had never seen anyone survive a carotid artery rupture .
human speech is an ingenious manipulation of our breath within the sound chamber of our mouth and respiratory system .
we need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath in order to form sounds .
because i had lost my jaw , i could no longer form a seal , and therefore my tongue and all of my other vocal equipment was rendered powerless .
then apple released the alex voice , which was the best i 'd heard .
when it saw a period , it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air .
there are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices , and i 've experimented with them .
people do n't have the time or the patience to wait for me to fool around with the codes for every word or phrase .
how did i feel not being able to speak ?
even then , i 'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties .
so chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my tv show voice from a period of 30 years .
but i decided then to just give it a try .
they 'd never made one from previously-recorded materials .
but they were willing to give it a try .
so i sent them many hours of recordings of my voice , including several audio commentary tracks that i 'd made for movies on dvds .
there was a reason for that ; it was me .
but it was n't that simple .
these are a few of the comments i recorded for use when chaz and i appeared on the oprah winfrey program .
and here 's the voice we call roger jr .
or roger 2.0 .
we have been talking for a long time , and now here we are again .
when i heard it the first time , it sent chills down my spine .
when i read something , it will read in my voice .
i have typed these words in advance , as i did n't think it would be thrilling to sit here watching me typing .
the voice was created by a company in scotland named cereproc .
`` it makes me feel good that many of the words you are hearing were first spoken while i was commenting on `` '' casablanca '' '' and `` '' citizen kane . '' '' this is the first voice they 've created for an individual . ''
there are several very good voices available for computers , but they all sound like somebody else , while this voice sounds like me .
i plan to use it on television , radio and the internet .
the flow is n't natural .
the good people in scotland are still improving my voice , and i 'm optimistic about it .
but so far , the apple alex voice is the best one i 've heard .
now i have spoken my last words , and i do n't even remember for sure what they were .
`` i feel like the hero of that harlan ellison story titled `` '' i have no mouth and i must scream . '' '' on wednesday , david christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time-span of the universe . ''
for almost all of its millions and billions of years , there was no life on earth at all .
finally came mankind 's most advanced and mysterious tool , the computer .
that has mostly happened in my lifetime .
when i heard the amazing talk by salman khan on wednesday , about the khan academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world , i had a flashback .
it was about 1960 .
the initials stood for programmed logic for automated teaching operations .
this was a computer-assisted instruction system , which in those days ran on a computer named illiac .
the programmers said it could assist students in their learning .
i doubt , on that day 50 years ago , they even dreamed of what salman khan has accomplished .
but that 's not the point .
it continued to evolve and operated in one form or another on more and more sophisticated computers , until only five years ago .
i started writing on a computer back in the 1970s when one of the first atech systems was installed at the chicago sun-times .
i was in line at radio shack to buy one of the first model 100 's .
when i bought my first desktop , it was a dec rainbow .
`` does anybody remember that ? '' '' ( applause ) `` '' the sun times sent me to the cannes film festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the porteram telebubble . ''
indeed , i am lucky to live in history at all , because without intelligence and memory there is no history .
for me , the internet began as a useful tool and now has become something i rely on for my actual daily existence .
computer voices are sometimes not very sophisticated , but with my computer , i can communicate more widely than ever before .
i feel as if my blog , my email , twitter and facebook have given me a substitute for everyday conversation .
they are n't an improvement , but they 're the best i can do .
not everybody has the patience of my wife , chaz .
this whole adventure has been a learning experience .
every time there was a surgery that failed , i was left with a little less flesh and bone .
when you see me today , i look like the phantom of the opera .
but no you do n't .
people — ( applause ) people talk loudly — i 'm so sorry .
( applause ) people talk loudly and slowly to me .
sometimes they assume i am deaf .
there are people who do n't want to make eye contact .
believe me , he did n't mean this as — anyway , let me just read it .
that 's why writing on the internet has become a lifesaver for me .
my ability to think and write have not been affected .
and on the web , my real voice finds expression .
one of my twitter friends can type only with his toes .
( laughter ) google him and he will make you laugh .
all of these people are saying , in one way or another , that what you see is not all you get .
so i have not come here to complain .
i seem , for the time being , to be cancer-free .
a guy goes into a psychiatrist .
if a computer voice can successfully tell a joke and do the timing and delivery as well as henny youngman , then that 's the voice i want .
it 's not something you smell or inhale ; it 's something you ingest .
now , most people thought they were nuts .
and they passed through the detector .
you know , it was the payoff of my career , basically .
so let me take a moment to tell you what i mean by a gravitational wave .
that 's a decimal place , 20 zeroes , and a one .
that 's why everyone thought the ligo people were nuts .
a lot of people are frustrated with passwords , and it 's bad enough when you have to have one really good password that you can remember but nobody else is going to be able to guess .
but what do you do when you have accounts on a hundred different systems and you 're supposed to have a unique password for each of these systems ?
it 's tough .
now entropy is a complicated term , but basically it measures the strength of passwords .
`` in fact , their report states , `` '' unfortunately , we do not have much data on the passwords users choose under particular rules . ''
how long is it ? does it have a digit ?
we also found some interesting things about the symbols people use in passwords .
so cmu allows 32 possible symbols , but as you can see , there 's only a small number that most people are using , so we 're not actually getting very much strength from the symbols in our passwords .
so it turns out there are a lot of people going around stealing passwords , and they often go and post these passwords on the internet .
this is still not really ideal for research , though , because it 's not entirely clear where all of these passwords came from , or exactly what policies were in effect when people created these passwords .
so we wanted to find some better source of data .
then some people had a much harder policy , and this was very similar to the cmu policy , that it had to have eight characters including uppercase , lowercase , digit , symbol , and pass a dictionary check .
we also wanted to get an idea of how strong the passwords were that people were creating , but as you may recall , there is n't a good measure of password strength .
so a dumb attacker will try every password in order .
they look at the passwords that are known to be popular from these stolen password sets , and they guess those first .
in fact , some of you probably have these passwords .
so what we found by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected through these tests to see how strong they were , we found that the long passwords were actually pretty strong , and the complex passwords were pretty strong too .
so this suggests that , instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers and crazy things into their passwords , we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords .
you can make long passwords that are still the sort of thing that an attacker could easily guess .
so we need to do more than just say long passwords .
you may have seen these on the internet when you were creating passwords .
we decided to do a study to find out whether these password meters actually work .
do they actually help people have stronger passwords , and if so , which ones are better ?
( laughter ) most of the password meters were actually effective , and the dancing bunny was very effective too , but the password meters that were the most effective were the ones that made you work harder before they gave you that thumbs up and said you were doing a good job , and in fact we found that most of the password meters on the internet today are too soft .
they tell you you 're doing a good job too early , and if they would just wait a little bit before giving you that positive feedback , you probably would have better passwords .
now another approach to better passwords , perhaps , is to use pass phrases instead of passwords .
`` so this was an xkcd cartoon from a couple of years ago , and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases , and if you look at the second row of this cartoon , you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase `` '' correct horse battery staple '' '' would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember . ''
he says , in fact , you 've already remembered it .
in fact , everybody who i talk to , who i mention i 'm doing password research , they point out this cartoon .
`` correct horse battery staple . '' '' so we did the research study to see what would actually happen . ''
now the reason we did this is that humans are not very good at picking random words .
if we asked a human to do it , they would pick things that were not very random .
`` in one condition , the computer picked from a dictionary of the very common words in the english language , and so you 'd get pass phrases like `` try there three come . '' ''
`` so you can get a pass phrase like `` plan builds sure power '' or `` '' end determines red drug . '' '' and these seemed a little bit more memorable , and maybe people would like those a little bit better . ''
we wanted to compare them with passwords , and so we had the computer pick random passwords , and these were nice and short , but as you can see , they do n't really look very memorable .
and then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password .
`` so here the computer picks random syllables and puts them together so you have something sort of pronounceable , like `` '' tufritvi '' '' and `` '' vadasabi . '' '' that one kind of rolls off your tongue . ''
so it 's not really a clear win for pass phrases .
sorry , all of you xkcd fans .
on the other hand , we did find that pronounceable passwords worked surprisingly well , and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better .
so one of the problems with some of the studies that we 've done is that because they 're all done using mechanical turk , these are not people 's real passwords .
they 're the passwords that they created or the computer created for them for our study .
so we talked to the information security office at carnegie mellon and asked them if we could have everybody 's real passwords .
and so we never actually saw anybody 's password .
we got some interesting results , and those of you tepper students in the back will be very interested in this .
and the size of the passwords is proportional to how frequently they appeared in the stolen dataset .
and what i did is i created this word cloud , and i went through all 1,000 words , and i categorized them into loose thematic categories .
`` so `` '' justin . '' '' is that the name of the user , their boyfriend , their son ? ''
are they disney princess fans ?
there 's a lot of love in these passwords .
`` and this was really curious to me , and i wondered , `` '' why are monkeys so popular ? '' '' and so in our last password study , any time we detected somebody creating a password with the word `` '' monkey '' '' in it , we asked them why they had a monkey in their password . ''
and yes , i 'm talking about smartphones ...
because it turns out there was an uber way before uber .
and if it had survived , the future of transportation would probably already be here .
in 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named lp draper .
he was a car salesman from la , and he had an idea .
he said , well , why do n't i just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney — that was slang for a nickel .
100 years later .
they were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut .
and so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney .
there were licenses — often they were pricey .
but there was a really interesting regulation which was they had to put a backseat light — install it in every jitney — to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning .
( laughter ) all right . so what happened ?
well , within a year this thing had taken off .
because , well , when you ca n't share a car , then you have to own one .
and that phenomenon had gone global .
in china by 2011 , there were more car sales happening in china than in the us .
now , all this private ownership of course had a public cost .
now , that 's only four percent of our problem though .
we even have skyscrapers built for cars .
now , cities have been dealing with this problem for decades .
it 's called mass transit .
why is that ?
well , it 's because mass transit has n't yet figured out how to get to everybody 's doorstep .
and so the beginning of uber in 2010 was — well , we just wanted to push a button and get a ride .
but it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride , and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides .
we saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place .
because if we did , that ride would be a lot cheaper — up to 50 percent cheaper — and of course for the city you 've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars .
could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it ?
in san francisco , before uberpool , we had — well , everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted .
and once we introduced uberpool , well , you see there 's not as many bright colors .
more people getting around the city in fewer cars , taking cars off the road .
it looks like uberpool is working .
and since then , we 've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads and we 've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of co2 out of the air .
now , in china everything is supersized , and so we 're doing 15 million uberpool trips per month , that 's 500,000 per day .
in fact , we 're seeing it in la , too .
`` and when i talk to my team , we do n't talk about , `` hey , well , 100,000 people carpooling every week and we 're done . '' ''
how do we get that to a million ?
and in china , well , that could be several million .
and every morning at about the same time , cars roll of out their driveway , most of them , one person in the car , and they go to work , they go to their place of work .
you get up in the morning , get ready for work , get your coffee , go to your car and you light up the uber app , and all of a sudden , you become an uber driver .
and we 'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work and it 's a really great thing .
there 's just one hitch ...
it 's called regulation .
well , that is what the us government has determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile .
you can pick up anybody in the united states and take them wherever they want to go at a moment 's notice , for 54 cents a mile or less .
but what if for 60 cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling in los angeles ?
if we could , it 's obviously something we should do .
and so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney .
how would our cities be different today ?
but technology has given us another opportunity .
but i 've got a couple other questions because i know they 're out there on people 's minds .
you had this very radical , very bold , brave redesign .
did you notice other people not finding the app that day ?
tk : well , first i should probably just say , well , what we were trying to accomplish .
which is , when we first got started , it was just black cars .
and so what we did was almost what i would call an immature version of a luxury brand that looked like a badge on a luxury car .
and as we 've gone worldwide and gone from s-classes to auto rickshaws in india , it became something that was important for us to be more accessible , to be more hyperlocal , to be about the cities we were in and that 's what you see with the patterns and colors .
and to be more iconic , because a u does n't mean anything in sanskrit , and a u does n't mean anything in mandarin .
some people feel you 've almost taken that culture too far , and you know — like a year or two ago there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset .
how did it feel like inside the company during that period ?
did you notice a loss of business ?
now , inside , we felt like — i guess at the end of the day we felt like we were good people doing good work , but on the outside that was n't evident .
and so when you go through that growth , you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time .
ca : it seems to me , everywhere you turn , you 're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time .
this thing 's taken off , you 're affecting the whole global economy , basically , at this point .
i mean — who are you ?
tk : well , there 's a few things packed in that question , so — ( laughter ) first is on the pricing side — i mean , keep in mind , right ?
uberx , when we first started , was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product .
it 's now in many cities , half the price of a taxi .
what happens is when the price goes down , people are more likely to take uber at different times of the day than they otherwise would have , and they 're more likely to use it in places they would n't have before .
and we have cities where we 've done literally five or six price cuts and have seen those price cuts go up over time .
`` so even in new york — we have a blog post we call `` '' 4 septembers '' '' — compare the earnings september after september after september . ''
same month every year .
and there 's a perfect price point — you ca n't go down forever .
so that addresses that first part .
and the way i like to describe it is it 's kind of like a math professor .
but we do n't want just any math problem , we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find , and we want the one that if you solve it , there 's a little bit of a wow factor .
tk : well , look , i think the first part is it 's going to take — it 's likely going to take a lot longer than i think some of the hype or media might expect .
that 's part one .
this is a world that 's going to exist , and for good reason .
a million people die a year in cars .
but how do we optimistically lead through it ?
are there ways to partner with cities ?
but it is a world that 's going to exist , and it is going to be a better world .
ca : travis , what you 're building is absolutely incredible and i 'm hugely grateful to you for coming to ted and sharing so openly .
thank you so much . tk : thank you very much .
( applause )
the record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive .
and there are two key things it 's got to do .
and so we need a post-conflict compact .
it 's not sustainable .
during conflict people are doing destruction .
another is , you can make ngos accountable .
it 's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem .
but to anyone who has n't visited , these images ca n't really fully convey .
( music ) i 'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing — that 's us there . that 's both of us actually — specifically about a concept that we 've been developing over the last few years , this idea of location-aware music .
now , my brother and i , we 're musicians and music producers .
but before i go too much further into that , let me tell you a little bit about how we got started with this idea .
my brother and i were living in new york city when the artists christo and jeanne-claude did their temporary installation , the gates , in central park .
this was an experience that stayed with us for a long time , and years later , my brother and i moved back to washington , d.c. , and we started to ask the question , would it be possible , in the same way that the gates responded to the physical layout of the park , to compose music for a landscape ?
hundreds of musical segments are geo-tagged throughout the entire park so that as a listener traverses the landscape , a musical score is actually unfolding around them .
let 's take a closer look .
let 's look at one example here .
so using the app , as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the washington monument , you hear the sounds of instruments warming up , which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody .
this is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins .
but were you to walk in the opposite direction , this entire sequence happens in reverse .
and were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park , the music would fade to silence , and the play button would disappear .
we 're sometimes contacted by people in other parts of the world who ca n't travel to the united states , but would like to hear this record .
in this case , the app is the work itself , and the architecture of the landscape is intrinsic to the listening experience .
( applause )
okay , a few of you .
so in july of that year , we went out on the glacier , and we found a big crack in the ice .
we had to build snow and ice anchors so that we could tie off ropes and rappel down into the hole .
now those of you taking trigonometry , that particular type of math is very useful for making maps like this because it allows you to measure heights and distances without actually having to go there .
there 's one thing that stayed consistent , though : the man leads and the woman follows .
`` you were n't just learning to dance — you were learning to `` '' man '' '' and to `` '' woman . '' '' it 's a relic . ''
this is n't the present .
it 's like shakespeare : respect it , revive it — great !
jf : well , the core principle of partner dancing is that one person leads , the other one follows .
the machine works the same , regardless of who 's playing which role .
together .
only .
ever .
so , same-sex and gender nonconformist couples just disappear .
what you will get is page after page of white , straight russian couples spray-tanned to the point of mahogany .
even within the white-straight- couple-only paradigm — she ca n't be taller , he ca n't be shorter .
she ca n't be bolder , he ca n't be gentler .
he dictates , she reacts .
interesting — appealing , even — but a little bit odd .
and here 's how it looked when we danced it in the opening dance .
and more importantly , you can change your mind .
now , this is only one example of how this applies , but once the blinkers come off , anything can happen .
( laughter ) so you 're out here on the floor , and then imagine that coming right at you .
and it never fails to engage .
but we dance with a consciousness that this is a historic form that can produce silence and produce invisibility across the spectrum of identity that we enjoy today .
this would result in a flood of x-rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles , plasma inside , centered on the pitcher 's mound , and that would move away from the pitcher 's mound slightly faster than the ball .
so this is the kind of question i answer , and i get people writing in with a lot of other strange questions .
can you do this one soon ?
but one week , a couple months ago , i got a question that was actually about google .
if all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards , how big would google 's data warehouse be ?
now , google 's pretty secretive about their operations , so no one really knows how much data google has , and in fact , no one really knows how many data centers google has , except people at google itself .
and i 've tried , i 've met them a few times , tried asking them , and they are n't revealing anything .
so i decided to try to figure this out myself .
there are a few things that i looked at here .
so they go through a huge number of them .
and so by looking at money , you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have .
you can also look at power .
you can look at how much electricity they need , because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers , and google is more efficient than most , but they still have some basic requirements , and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers that they have .
you can also look at square footage and see of the data centers that you know , how big are they ?
how much room is that ?
how many server racks could you fit in there ?
you know how much they spent , and they also , say , because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided , you might know what they made a deal to buy , so you know how much power it takes .
and you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities , you know , with guesses about the total amount of storage , the number of servers , the number of drives per server , and in each case using what you know to come up with a model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you do n't know .
it 's sort of circling around the number you 're trying to get .
and this is a lot of fun .
the math is not all that advanced , and really it 's like nothing more than solving a sudoku puzzle .
so what i did , i went through all of this information , spent a day or two researching .
and there are some things i did n't look at .
sometimes , when people visit a data center , they 'll take a cell-cam photo and post it , and they are n't supposed to , but you can learn things about their hardware that way .
turns out , they know where all the google data centers are , at least the ones that have people in them .
so i came up with this estimate , and this is a staggering amount of data .
it 's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has , as far as we know .
adding all of this up , i came up with the other thing that we can answer , which is , how many punch cards would this take ?
and so a punch card can hold about 80 characters , and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box , and you put them in , say , my home region of new england , it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers , which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about 20,000 years ago .
so i get some software and start reading it , and scan them , and it turns out it 's a puzzle .
( applause )
but apparently , this is a strange paradox of life .
it 's really lovely .
the human being is compassion because what is our brain for ?
and he would have tremendous fun doing that .
`` so then you decide , `` '' well , i 'm sick of myself . ''
welcome to doha .
and of course , most of you have had three meals today , and probably will continue to have after this event .
so going in , what was qatar in the 1940s ?
most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages , fishing , or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water .
none of the glamour that you see today existed .
no cities like you see today in doha or dubai or abu dhabi or kuwait or riyadh .
it was n't that they could n't develop cities .
resources were n't there to develop them .
and you can see that life expectancy was also short .
most people died around the age of 50 .
1939 , that 's when they discovered oil .
what did it do ?
it also made all those people who roamed around the desert — looking for water , looking for food , trying to take care of their livestock — urbanize .
my mother has an accent that is so different to my father , and we 're all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country .
there are about five or six accents in this country as i speak .
we could n't live in a concentrated way simply because there was no resources .
people started to get to know each other .
and we realized that there are some differences in accents .
so that is the chapter two : the oil era .
so what 's the population today ?
the average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years .
lifespan has increased to 78 .
and this is amongst the highest worldwide .
from having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree , higher than any other nation .
but what is interesting about the story that i 've just said ?
now that is historic . it 's never happened before in history .
build a nice home , bring the architect , design my house .
but of course , with the use of technology .
so brazil has 1,782 millimeters per year of precipitation of rain .
the question is how .
how could we survive that ?
simply because of this gigantic , mammoth machine called desalination .
energy is the key factor here . it changed everything .
so that is our lake , if you can see it .
that is our river .
i would say , perhaps if you look at the global facts , you will realize , of course i have to worry .
there is growing demand , growing population .
and so that number also demands food .
and there 's predictions that we 'll be nine billion by 2050 .
so a country that has no water has to worry about what happens beyond its borders .
they start eating more meat and so on and so forth .
on the other hand , there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors .
and so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen .
this is the situation in qatar , for those who do n't know .
these risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity .
the question is , is there a solution ?
is there a sustainable solution ?
indeed there is .
or should we use something else ?
do we have the comparative advantage to use another sort of energy ?
i guess most of you by now realize that we do : 300 days of sun .
and so we will use that renewable energy to produce the water that we need .
and we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water .
and that is a lot of water .
that water will go then to the farmers , and the farmers will be able to water their plants , and they will be able then to supply society with food .
but in order to sustain the horizontal line — because these are the projects , these are the systems that we will deliver — we need to also develop the vertical line : system sustenance , high-level education , research and development , industries , technologies , to produce these technologies for application , and finally markets .
so that 's what we are planning to do .
our objective is to be a millennium city , just like many millennium cities around : istanbul , rome , london , paris , damascus , cairo .
( applause )
young libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime , raising slogans of freedom , dignity , social justice .
they have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south .
eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
( applause ) however , gaddafi left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds of diversions .
for four decades gaddafi 's tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of libyan society .
aware of the devastation and the challenges , i was keen among many other women to rebuild the libyan civil society , calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
almost 200 organizations were established in benghazi during and immediately after the fall of gaddafi — almost 300 in tripoli .
after a period of 33 years in exile , i went back to libya , and with unique enthusiasm , i started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
i met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections , an environment which was increasingly polarized , an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
i led an initiative by the libyan women 's platform for peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law , a law that would give every citizen , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists , creating the zipper list .
eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
( applause ) however , bit by bit , the euphoria of the elections , and of the revolution as a whole , was fading out — for every day we were waking up to the news of violence .
of the assassination of army officers .
our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles — freedom , dignity , social justice — that we first held .
i am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections .
did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation ?
why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion , by both men and women ?
maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the feminine values of compassion , mercy and inclusion .
our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine .
we need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
these are the ideals that a war-torn libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace .
that 's the real zipper .
`` according to a quranic verse `` salam '' — peace — `` is the word of the all-merciful god , raheem . '' ''
`` thus we are told that `` '' my mercy encompasses all things . '' '' thus we are told that `` '' my mercy takes precedence over my anger . '' '' may we all be granted a grace of mercy . ''
so i 've got a question for you .
let 's talk about the journey , mainly about the future .
let 's talk about the state .
let 's talk about what sort of a web we want .
i wrote the code .
i was i suppose the first user .
it took off . it was pretty cool .
in 2008 , we formed the world wide web foundation partly to look at that and worry about that figure .
online commerce has in some cases completely turned upside down the way commerce works altogether , made types of commerce available which were n't available at all before .
commerce has been almost universally affected .
also , lots of things which are less visible .
so we can not assume that part of the web , part of the deal with the web , is when i use the web , it 's just a transparent , neutral medium .
so in fact , something we realized , we ca n't just use the web , we have to worry about what the underlying infrastructure of the whole thing , is it in fact of a quality that we need ?
we love the fact that the web is open .
it does n't matter who we are .
what sort of web do you want ?
i want a web which has got , for example , is a really good basis for democracy .
i want a web where i can use healthcare with privacy and where there 's a lot of health data , clinical data is available to scientists to do research .
i want a web which is such a powerful basis for innovation that when something nasty happens , some disaster strikes , that we can respond by building stuff to respond to it very quickly .
so this is just some of the things that i want , from a big list , obviously it 's longer .
you have your list .
i want us to use this 25th anniversary to think about what sort of a web we want .
let 's do that this year .
thank you .
`` and what is your name ? '' '' and i 'm just quiet , unable to respond . ''
and i 'm still quiet .
`` and then , slowly , all the other people in the room begin to turn toward me and ask , almost in unison , ( voice-over , several voices ) `` '' have you forgotten your name ? '' '' as the chant gets louder , i want to respond , but i do n't . ''
i 'm a visual artist .
some of my work is humorous , and some is a bit funny but in a sad way .
i 've been a bear .
( laughter ) safwat saleem : i 've been a whale .
( laughter ) ss : i 've been a greeting card .
( video ) greeting card ( ss 's voice ) : hi .
( laughter ) ss : and my personal favorite is frankenstein 's monster .
a few years ago , i made this educational video about the history of video games .
and for that one , i got to do the voice of space invader .
( video ) space invader ( ss 's voice ) : hi .
`` i hit `` '' refresh . '' '' ( video ) comment : excellent video . i look forward to the next one . ''
it felt like i had finally arrived .
`` i hit `` '' refresh . '' '' ( video ) comment : his voice is annoying . no offense . ''
ss : ok , no offense taken . refresh .
number one , i do n't have an indian accent , i have a pakistani accent , ok ?
every single time , it would take me back to my childhood , when i had a much harder time speaking .
i 've stuttered for as long as i can remember .
if it was for me , my parents would say i 'm not around .
`` i 'd always stutter on my name , and there was usually someone who 'd go , `` have you forgotten your name ? '' ''
that joke never got old .
and so you see , eventually for me to even be able to use my voice in my work was a huge step for me .
i can slow it down , speed it up , make it deeper , add an echo .
and so i stopped using my voice in my work .
since then , i 've thought a lot about what it means to be normal .
let me give you an example .
i came across this story about the ancient greek writer , homer .
now , homer mentions very few colors in his writing .
but it 's not just homer .
if you look at all of the ancient literature — ancient chinese , icelandic , greek , indian and even the original hebrew bible — they all mention very few colors .
and the most popular theory for why that might be the case is that cultures begin to recognize a color only once they have the ability to make that color .
so basically , if you can make a color , only then can you see it .
a color like red , which was fairly easy for many cultures to make — they began to see that color fairly early on .
but the people commenting did not know how self-conscious i am about my voice .
they were mostly reacting to my accent , that it is not normal for a narrator to have an accent .
but what is normal , anyway ?
and we know that resumes with white-sounding names get more callbacks than resumes with black-sounding names .
why is that ?
and we think it is normal that a white employee is a better hire than a black employee .
( laughter ) just like the color blue for ancient greeks , minorities are not a part of what we consider normal , because normal is simply a construction of what we 've been exposed to , and how visible it is around us .
and this is where things get a bit difficult .
or i can challenge that preexisting notion of normal with my work and with my voice and with my accent and by standing here onstage , even though i 'm scared shitless and would rather be in the bathroom .
and so we must continuously challenge our notion of normal , because doing so is going to allow us as a society to finally see the sky for what it is .
( applause )
( audio ) ag : most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
i can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cord , and at their darkest time , it is very difficult to bring them back .
now , veteran officers and psychologists train new officers .
and he leapt .
i 'm sure i was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore london , but the message i missed was the need to start exploring and embracing myself .
this is a picornavirus .
and so took this first example , which is called coxsackievirus , and just break it into small windows .
and so we 're getting unique signatures , a fingerprint for each virus .
that 's me , getting a nasal lavage .
and this is what this looks like .
so let 's do something a little bit harder .
we put the beeper in the clinic .
this sort of tree and bud formation indicates there 's inflammation ; there 's likely to be infection .
i mean , they went to the max for this woman .
is it a link to oncogenesis ? i do n't know .
little robots are cute when they play music to you .
we 're going down to the cellular level these days .
after extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber , which i realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot , i decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive pressure-sensitive ink particles .
this prevented the system from dying in the middle of the night .
thank you very much .
in my previous life , i was an artist .
i love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities , and i try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics , and i see part of my job today , the reason for being here , not just to campaign for my party , but for politics , and the role it can play for the better in our lives .
art was part of the answer , and my name , in the very beginning , was linked with two things : demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back , and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city .
but this use of colors was not just an artistic act .
he screeched that he would block the financing .
`` `` '' because the colors you have ordered do not meet european standards , '' '' he replied . ''
`` `` '' well , '' '' i told him , `` '' the surroundings do not meet european standards , even though this is not what we want , but we will choose the colors ourselves , because this is exactly what we want . ''
the rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost .
the pride of people about their own place of living , and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal , barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space .
and when colors came out everywhere , a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people .
`` big noise raised up : `` '' what is this ? what is happening ? ''
`` what are colors doing to us ? '' '' and we made a poll , the most fascinating poll i 've seen in my life . ''
people started to drop less litter in the streets , for example , started to pay taxes , started to feel something they had forgotten , and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police , or the state itself , were missing .
`` `` '' why did you throw away the shutters ? '' '' i asked him . ''
`` `` safer ? why ? they have posted more policemen here ? '' ''
`` `` '' come on , man ! what policemen ? ''
crime did fall .
the freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of anarchy in the city , while the barbarism of the '90s brought about a loss of hope for the city .
we planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets .
we established a green tax , and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly .
international organizations have invested a lot in albania during these 20 years , not all of it well spent .
when i told the world bank directors that i wanted them to finance a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption , they did not understand me .
but people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks .
they were paying in order to skip the queue , the long queue .
the reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole , and , on the other hand , a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe .
`` `` '' i 'm convinced , '' '' i told a german official with the world bank , `` '' that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in germany , in a german administration , just as i am convinced that if you put german officials from the german administration in those holes , they would be bribed just the same . '' '' ( applause ) it 's not about genes . ''
it 's not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience .
it 's about system , it 's about organization .
we removed the kiosks .
we created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes .
we put the citizen first , and not the clerks .
( applause ) things have come to this point because politicians in general , but especially in our countries , let 's face it , think people are stupid .
politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians , while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation .
seen from those stairs , all politicians today seem the same , and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism .
barack obama won — ( applause ) — because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks .
he did not know each and every one of them , but with an admirable ingenuity , he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign .
i tweet . i love it .
i love it because it lets me get the message out , but it also lets people get their messages to me .
this is politics , not from top down , but from the bottom up , and sideways , and allowing everybody 's voice to be heard is exactly what we need .
it is about how people think , how they view the world around them , how they use their time and their energy .
when people say all politicians are the same , ask yourself if obama was the same as bush , if françois hollande is the same as sarkozy .
when people say nothing can change , just stop and think what the world was like 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 years ago .
our world is defined by the pace of change .
we can all change the world .
i want to make more change as prime minister of my country , but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to .
`` president roosevelt , he said , `` believe you can , and you are halfway there . '' ''
efharisto and kalinihta .
now , a tar kettle does n't sound like much of an inheritance . it was n't .
in chicago , there 's amazing building stock .
`` if we wanted to show `` '' car wash , '' '' we could . ''
that would be awesome .
but what do you do in neighborhoods when ai n't nobody interested in living there ?
and so i was trying to wake them up using culture .
and so we just started imagining , what else could happen in this building ?
so thinking about those things together feels right .
tg : right on . so i think this is where it starts to get into the thick weeds .
( applause )
the self : you are self-aware .
it 's experienced by people occasionally .
you fake it and make it . this is the mantra of the united states of america .
let me act compassionately .
`` i directed a movie two years ago called `` '' step up 2 : the streets . '' '' anybody ? anybody ? yeah ! ''
they could fly in the air . they could bend their elbow all the way back .
but after seeing what i 've seen , the truth is , they have not disappeared at all .
dance has never had a better friend than technology .
and , i do n't know , i kind of get a kick out of that a little bit .
i was young when i started . i was younger than a lot of the people i was dancing with .

i believe in aid .
for the past few years , i 've been spending my summers in the marine biological laboratory in woods hole , massachusetts .
so , we ride off from eel pond into vineyard sound , right off the coast of martha 's vineyard , equipped with a drone to identify potential spots from which to peer into the atlantic .
this is a jellyfish .
but look closely , and living inside of this animal is another organism that is very likely entirely new to science .
not quite .
this is an ascidian .
meet your cousin , thalia democratica .
today , many of the biological sciences only see value in studying deeper what we already know — in mapping already-discovered continents .
but some of us are much more interested in the unknown .
we want to discover completely new continents , and gaze at magnificent vistas of ignorance .
we crave the experience of being completely baffled by something we 've never seen before .
but this is not a self-aggrandizing enterprise , because in this type of discovery research , if you do n't feel like a complete idiot most of the time , you 're just not sciencing hard enough .
i would like tonight to tell you a story about life that rarely gets told in an environment like this .
we sense that after centuries of scientific research , we 're beginning to make significant inroads into understanding some of the most fundamental principles of life .
our collective optimism is reflected by the growth of biotechnology across the globe , striving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases .
things like cancer , aging , degenerative diseases ; these are but some of the undesirables we wish to tame .
i often wonder : why is it that we are having so much trouble trying to solve the problem of cancer ?
is it that we 're trying to solve the problem of cancer , and not trying to understand life ?
life on this planet shares a common origin , and i can summarize 3.5 billion years of the history of life on this planet in a single slide .
and though i do n't really want to disparage at all the accomplishments of our species , as much as we wish it to be so and often pretend that it is , we are not the measure of all things .
we are , however , the measurers of many things .
we relentlessly quantify , analyze and compare , and some of this is absolutely invaluable and indeed necessary .
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently estimated that about 95 percent of our oceans remain unexplored .
now let that sink in for a second .
i 'm almost willing to bet that many of you have never heard of the flatworm , schmidtea mediterranea .
this little guy right here does things that essentially just blow my mind .
for the past decade and a half or so , i 've been trying to figure out how these little dudes do what they do , and how they pull this magic trick off .
each planarian an ocean unto itself , full of unknowns .
and that 's because , unfortunately , these seven animals essentially correspond to 0.0009 percent of all of the species that inhabit the planet .
that 's because life on this planet and its history is the history of rule breakers .
`` land masses began to emerge from the surface of the oceans , and another creature thought , `` '' hey , that looks like a really nice piece of real estate . ''
they break the rules .
so if we 're going to study animals that break the rules , should n't how we study them also break the rules ?
rather than bring nature into our laboratories and interrogate it there , we need to bring our science into the majestic laboratory that is nature , and there , with our modern technological armamentarium , interrogate every new form of life we find , and any new biological attribute that we may find .
we actually need to bring all of our intelligence to becoming stupid again — clueless [ before ] the immensity of the unknown .
because after all , science is not really about knowledge .
`` once , antoine de saint-exupéry wrote , `` '' if you want to build a ship , do n't drum up people to collect wood and do n't assign them tasks and work , but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea ... '' '' as a scientist and a teacher , i like to paraphrase this to read that we scientists need to teach our students to long for the endless immensity of the sea that is our ignorance . ''
so i ask you : are n't we the best chance that life has to know itself ?
and if so , what the heck are we waiting for ?
thank you .
( applause )
( cheers ) and so i decided that i should probably write my own ted talk , and so that is what i am here to do .
i 'm here to talk about my own observations about storytelling .
stories are the antidote to bias .
in fact , today , if you are middle class and connected via the internet , you can download stories at the touch of a button or the swipe of a screen .
you can listen to a podcast about what it 's like to grow up dalit in kolkata .
storytellers are often do-gooders like me and , i suspect , yourselves .
firstly , stories can create an illusion of solidarity .
you have n't done anything .
but the inverse is also true .
if you do n't like someone , then you do n't care about them .
`` instinct steps in , and i start screaming , `` '' mwizi , mwizi ! '' '' which means `` '' thief '' '' in swahili . ''
and out of the woodworks , all of these people come out and they start to give chase .
and so they make him say sorry .
so it was a hard lesson that he did n't like me , but you know what , he was right .
i was a middle-class kid living in a poor country .
sometimes , it 's the messages that we do n't want to hear , the ones that make us want to crawl out of ourselves , that we need to hear the most .
increasingly , we are living in a society where there are larger forces at play , where stories are actually for many people beginning to replace the news .
now , this is significant .
that 's what pushes the needle forward in terms of social justice .
so a few concluding thoughts on what audiences can do to make the world a better place .
and then lastly , i think that audiences can make the world a better place by switching off their phones , by stepping away from their screens and stepping out into the real world beyond what feels safe .
( applause )
by mid-century we 'll be about 80 percent urban , and that 's mostly in the developing world , where that 's happening .
it 's interesting , because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities .
it 's qualitatively different .
1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like .
well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had 1,000 years ago .
subsistence farming is drying up basically .
( laughter ) because in town — this is the bustling squatter city of kibera , near nairobi — they see action . they see opportunity .
the aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters , all one billion of them , are building the urban world , which means they 're building the world — personally , one by one , family by family , clan by clan , neighborhood by neighborhood .
well , steal their own infrastructure , at first .
it is not the case that slums undermine prosperity , not the working slums ; they help create prosperity .
social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense .
these people are valuable as a group .
and that 's how they work .
there are things they care about .
you look at that lane on the right .
it 's much more interactive .
the main event is , these are not people crushed by poverty .
they 're helping each other do it .
furthermore , people in the informal economy , the gray economy — as time goes by , crime is happening around them . and they can join the criminal world , or they can join the legitimate world .
in dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself , but it performs services for the city at large .
and one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools .
education is more possible in the cities , and that changes the world .
in this case , supply right next to demand .
we are learning about how dense proximity can be .
connectivity between the city and the country is what 's going to keep the country good , because the city has interesting ways of doing things .
and when they 're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly .
that 's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way .
the immediately have fewer children .
very interesting side effect here , here 's a slide from phillip longman .
and they are regionally separated .
what you 're getting is a world which is old folks , and old cities , going around doing things the old way , in the north .
and young people in brand new cities they 're inventing , doing new things , in the south .
shift of subject . quickly drop by climate .
from your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades , and what goes along with that , which is resource wars and chaos wars , as we 're seeing in darfur .
that 's what drought does .
shift to the power situation .
wind and solar ca n't help , because so far we do n't have a way to store that energy .
whereas a coal-burning plant , a normal one gigawatt coal plant , burns 80 rail cars of coal a day , each car having 100 tons .
and it puts 18 thousand tons of carbon dioxide in the air .
this is good for the atmosphere .
it 's good for their prosperity .
i want to point out one interesting thing , which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower .
and they 're selling these floating reactors , only 35 megawatts , to developing countries .
these things are way smaller . they 're much more adaptable .
so i think microreactors is going to be important for the future .
and that 's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room , 20 percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear .
this is a list of them .
like wars over water , such as in the indus .
and if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization .
to put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year .
two men , rahul and rajiv , living in the same neighborhood , from the same educational background , similar occupation , and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain .
in the developing countries of the world , this gap is even larger .
but beyond the impact of a health condition on life expectancy , we 're also concerned about the quality of life lived .
now when we do that , we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective .
depression , for example , is the third-leading cause of disability , alongside conditions such as diarrhea and pneumonia in children .
when you put all the mental illnesses together , they account for roughly 15 percent of the total global burden of disease .
i see some nodding heads there .
but beyond the staggering numbers , what 's truly important from a global health point of view , what 's truly worrying from a global health point of view , is that the vast majority of these affected individuals do not receive the care that we know can transform their lives , and remember , we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions , medicines , psychological interventions , and social interventions , can make a vast difference .
in the sorts of countries i work in , that so-called treatment gap approaches an astonishing 90 percent .
it is n't surprising , then , that if you should speak to anyone affected by a mental illness , the chances are that you will hear stories of hidden suffering , shame and discrimination in nearly every sector of their lives .
and an especially important challenge that i 've had to face is the great shortage of mental health professionals , such as psychiatrists and psychologists , particularly in the developing world .
any case , i went on , i soldiered on with psychiatry , and found myself training in britain in some of the best hospitals in this country . i was very privileged .
in zimbabwe , for example , there were just about a dozen psychiatrists , most of whom lived and worked in harare city , leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the countryside .
to give you a perspective , if i had to translate the proportion of psychiatrists in the population that one might see in britain to india , one might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in india .
in reality , take a guess .
i had to think out of the box about some other model of care .
the idea is actually quite simple . the idea is , when you 're short of specialized health care professionals , use whoever is available in the community , train them to provide a range of health care interventions , and in these books i read inspiring examples , for example of how ordinary people had been trained to deliver babies , diagnose and treat early pneumonia , to great effect .
well today , i 'm very pleased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade , and i want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments , all three of which focused on depression , the most common of all mental illnesses .
and in my own trial in goa , in india , we again showed that lay counselors drawn from local communities could be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions for depression , anxiety , leading to 70 percent recovery rates as compared to 50 percent in the comparison primary health centers .
the first is that we need to simplify the message that we 're using , stripping away all the jargon that medicine has invented around itself .
we need to unpack complex health care interventions into smaller components that can be more easily transferred to less-trained individuals .
and importantly , we need to reallocate the few specialists who are available to perform roles such as capacity-building and supervision .
now for me , task shifting is an idea with truly global significance , because even though it has arisen out of the situation of the lack of resources that you find in developing countries , i think it has a lot of significance for better-resourced countries as well . why is that ?
well , in part , because health care in the developed world , the health care costs in the [ developed ] world , are rapidly spiraling out of control , and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs .
but equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it 's become very remote and removed from local communities .
for me , what 's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting , though , is n't that it simply makes health care more accessible and affordable but that it is also fundamentally empowering .
it empowers ordinary people to be more effective in caring for the health of others in their community , and in doing so , to become better guardians of their own health . indeed , for me , task shifting is the ultimate example of the democratization of medical knowledge , and therefore , medical power .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assembled at alma-ata and made this iconic declaration .
it is for this reason that , some years ago , the movement for global mental health was founded as a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals like myself and people affected by mental illness could stand together , shoulder-to-shoulder , and advocate for the rights of people with mental illness to receive the care that we know can transform their lives , and to live a life with dignity .
the universe is teeming with planets .
i want us , in the next decade , to build a space telescope that 'll be able to image an earth about another star and figure out whether it can harbor life .
astronomers now believe that every star in the galaxy has a planet , and they speculate that up to one fifth of them have an earth-like planet that might be able to harbor life , but we have n't seen any of them .
why have n't we done that ? why is that hard ?
well to see , let 's imagine we take the hubble space telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of mars .
we 'll see something like that , a slightly blurry picture of the earth , because we 're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of mars .
now let 's move ten times further away .
here we are at the orbit of uranus .
we can still see the little moon , but let 's go ten times further away again .
here we are out at the oort cloud , outside the solar system , and we 're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into where the planet is .
one more time , ten times further away .
now we 're at alpha centauri , our nearest neighbor star , and the planet is gone .
all we 're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that 's ten billion times brighter than the planet , which should be in that little red circle .
that 's what we want to see . that 's why it 's hard .
it 's scattering inside the telescope , creating that very bright image that washes out the planet .
so to see the planet , we have to do something about all of that light .
we have to get rid of it .
i have a lot of colleagues working on really amazing technologies to do that , but i want to tell you about one today that i think is the coolest , and probably the most likely to get us an earth in the next decade .
it would be the same thing if i put my thumb up and blocked that spotlight that 's getting right in my eye , i can see you in the back row .
well the moon is casting a shadow down on the earth .
spitzer 's suggestion was we do this in space .
we build a big screen , we fly it in space , we put it up in front of the star , we block out most of the light , we fly a space telescope in that shadow that 's created , and boom , we get to see planets .
so there 's that big screen , and there 's no planets , because unfortunately it does n't actually work very well , because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope .
if we can feather the edges , soften those edges so we can control diffraction , well then we can see a planet , and in the last 10 years or so we 've come up with optimal solutions for doing that .
it looks something like that .
we call that our flower petal starshade .
if we make the edges of those petals exactly right , if we control their shape , we can control diffraction , and now we have a great shadow .
that starshade is about the size of half a football field and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope that has to be held right in its shadow , and then we can see those planets .
this sounds formidable , but brilliant engineers , colleagues of mine at jpl , came up with a fabulous design for how to do that and it looks like this .
it separates from the telescope .
then you 'll see it flip and fly out that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope .
( applause ) thank you .
last summer , we did a really cool test out in california at northrop grumman .
it 's about half the size of the one you just saw .
those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at jpl .
the base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter .
we ran this test 16 times , and 16 times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter .
this has to be done very precisely , but if we can do this , if we can build this technology , if we can get it into space , you might see something like this .
that 's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the hubble space telescope .
if we can take a similar space telescope , slightly larger , put it out there , fly an occulter in front of it , what we might see is something like that — that 's a family portrait of our solar system — but not ours .
we want to see that , see if there 's water , oxygen , ozone , the things that might tell us that it could harbor life .
that 's why i got into doing this , because i think that will change the world .
that will change everything when we see that .
thank you .
( applause )
my passions are music , technology and making things .
this is a rubens ' tube . it 's one of many i 've made over the years , and i have one here tonight .
so , let 's fire it up and see what it does .
( frequency ) thank you . ( applause ) it 's okay to applaud the laws of physics , but essentially what 's happening here — ( laughter ) — is the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules is influencing the combustion properties of propane , creating a visible waveform , and we can see the alternating regions of compression and rarefaction that we call frequency , and the height is showing us amplitude .
so let 's change the frequency of the sound , and watch what happens to the fire .
thank you . ( applause ) i also have with me a flame table .
it 's very similar to a rubens ' tube , and it 's also used for visualizing the physical properties of sound , such as eigenmodes , so let 's fire it up and see what it does .
ooh . ( laughter ) okay . now , while the table comes up to pressure , let me note here that the sound is not traveling in perfect lines . it 's actually traveling in all directions , and the rubens ' tube 's a little like bisecting those waves with a line , and the flame table 's a little like bisecting those waves with a plane , and it can show a little more subtle complexity , which is why i like to use it to watch geoff farina play guitar .
( music ) all right , so it 's a delicate dance .
if you watch closely — ( applause ) if you watch closely , you may have seen some of the eigenmodes , but also you may have seen that jazz music is better with fire .
actually , a lot of things are better with fire in my world , but the fire 's just a foundation .
`` so here , i 'm using a rendering algorithm to paint the frequencies of the song `` '' smells like teen spirit '' '' in a way that the eyes can take them in as a single visual impression , and the technique will also show the strengths of the visual cortex for pattern recognition . ''
`` at least , it 's powerful enough that if i show you these four songs , and i remind you that this is `` '' smells like teen spirit , '' '' you can probably correctly guess , without listening to any music at all , that the song a die hard nirvana fan would enjoy is this song , `` '' i 'll stick around '' '' by the foo fighters , whose lead singer is dave grohl , who was the drummer in nirvana . ''
so if we were to render these sounds visually , we might end up with something like this .
and in the middle of the recording , the mics pick this up , but later in the recording , this kid shows up , and he starts using a line at the top of the park to do some very advanced tricks on something called the tall rail .
all right , from skate physics to theoretical physics .
it listens to the lecture , and then it uses the amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis , and it uses the inflection of sentences to move a same point up and down on the y-axis .
and these trend lines , you can see , there 's more questions than answers in the laws of physics , and when we reach the end of a sentence , we place a star at that location .
so i made a more interactive version , and the way i did that is i used their position in time in the lecture to place these stars into 3d space , and with some custom software and a kinect , i can walk right into the lecture .
i 'm going to wave through the kinect here and take control , and now i 'm going to reach out and i 'm going to touch a star , and when i do , it will play the sentence that generated that star .
stephen hawking : there is one , and only one , arrangement in which the pieces make a complete picture .
there 's no closed captioning for the ted theme song , and we 're missing it , but if you 've watched enough of these , you hear it in your mind 's ear , and then applause starts .
it usually begins here , and it grows and then it falls .
all right , so let 's watch this clip again .
even on the first view , your eyes will successfully pick out patterns , but on repeated views , your brain actually gets better at turning these patterns into information .
that famous scene in horror movies where someone is walking up from behind is something you can see , and i believe this information would be something that is useful at times when the audio is turned off or not heard at all , and i speculate that deaf audiences might actually even be better at seeing sound than hearing audiences .
actually , it 's all just an idea .
and let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions , and so do ideas .
sw : big finish .
( audience : shopping . ) dm : shopping .
because america is an incredibly rich country .
so its military budget is bound to be enormous .
she has a high-risk pregnancy .
another reason jane is not so happy is because she 's worried .
what happens when she 's home ?
so jane basically has one of two options : stay at the hospital on bed rest , a prisoner to the technology until she gives birth , and then spend the rest of her life paying for the bill ; or head home after her 10-day stay and hope for the best .
so as we began to build these types of systems , we began to test them on ourselves in our research group .
here is a picture of a pregnant woman in labor at our university hospital being monitored for her uterine contractions with the conventional belt .
some of the things we had imagined were beginning to come to fruition , and we were actually seeing this in a clinical context .
`` rather than just making them work with adhesives , let 's integrate them into adhesives , and that could solve our manufacturing problem . '' '' this picture that you see here is our ability to embed these censors inside of a piece of scotch tape by simply peeling it off of a wafer . ''
think about jane for a moment .
we can not outsmart all the hackers in the world , but perhaps we can present them a smaller target .
well , not so fast .
this has been a long learning process for us .
thank you .
in every society where incomes have risen , so has protein consumption .
we could all become vegan .
we were inspired by sylvia earle , who won the ted prize in 2009 .
and now let 's compare that with fish farming .
well , that 's because fish , first of all , float .
once you know , you know .
there 's great technologies popping up all over the globe .
thank you .
and they paid a lot .
ca : you were a code-cracker .
and i gave my own views ...
there it is .
ca : it led to you publishing a famous paper together .
and vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two .
so , this is called the euler characteristic .
it 's pretty amazing .
i made quite a lot of money with pure luck .
i did n't really know how to hire people to do fundamental trading .
ca : so these different predictive schemes can be really quite wild and unexpected .
she kept the books , and so on .
so , that may be typical .
so , what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion ?
before the war , america had been highly protectionist .
so there 's the optimism .
that 's norway , the richest country in europe . it 's australia . it 's canada .
nigerian newspapers circulations spiked .
so , we know it works . what would the content be of these international standards ?
please , become ambassadors .
but that 's just an example .
but i know that it 's there .
take the planet venus .
it 's named after the roman goddess of love and beauty , because of its benign , ethereal appearance in the sky .
but spacecraft measurements revealed a different story .
that 's hot enough to melt lead .
its thick atmosphere , not its distance from the sun , is the reason .
so that 's more than 100 trillion miles .
that 's why the iceberg in this photo looks so blue .
( applause )
eric berlow : i 'm an ecologist , and sean 's a physicist , and we both study complex networks .
and then we thought , you know , there are thousands of other talks out there , especially tedx talks , that are popping up all over the world .
how are they connected , and what does that global conversation look like ?
so sean 's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that .
sean gourley : exactly . so we took 24,000 tedx talks from around the world , 147 different countries , and we took these talks and we wanted to find the mathematical structures that underly the ideas behind them .
and we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other .
so we can take their transcript and actually do some pretty cool things .
and we call that the meme-ome .
let 's see how it works in actual practice .
so what we 've got here now is the global footprint of all the tedx talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from new york all the way down to little old new zealand in the corner .
cameron russell talking about image and beauty connected over into europe .
we 've got a bigger conversation about israel and palestine radiating outwards from the middle east .
and we 've got something a little broader like big data with a truly global footprint reminiscent of a conversation that is happening everywhere .
so from this , we kind of run up against the limits of what we can actually do with a geographic projection , but luckily , computer technology allows us to go out into multidimensional space .
so we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this , and the similar talks kind of smash together , and the different ones fly apart , and what we 're left with is something quite beautiful .
they come from the network structure of interconnected ideas . keep going .
sg : absolutely . so i got a little quick on that , but he 's going to slow me down .
we 've got education connected to storytelling triangulated next to social media .
you 've got , of course , the human brain right next to healthcare , which you might expect , but also you 've got video games , which is sort of adjacent , as those two spaces interface with each other .
the structure starts to emerge where we see a kind of fractal behavior of the words and the language that we use to describe the things that are important to us all around this world .
so you 've got food economy and local food at the top , you 've got greenhouse gases , solar and nuclear waste .
what you 're getting is a range of smaller conversations , each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share , creating a broader concept of the environment .
and of course , from here , we can go and zoom in and see , well , what are young people looking at ?
and so there 's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here , and i 'll throw to eric for the next part .
let 's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment , and look at all the talks together .
now often , when we 're faced with this amount of content , we do a couple of things to simplify it .
we might just say , well , what are the most popular talks out there ?
and a few rise to the surface .
there 's another one about personal health and nutrition .
what 's trending now ? what 's the popular talk now ?
and i hate that . how do we bubble stuff up to the surface that 's maybe really creative and interesting ?
well , we can go back to the network structure of ideas to do that .
remember , it 's that network structure that is creating these emergent topics , and let 's say we could take two of them , like cities and genetics , and say , well , are there any talks that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines .
and that 's — essentially , this kind of creative remix is one of the hallmarks of innovation .
well here 's one by jessica green about the microbial ecology of buildings .
it 's literally defining a new field .
and then , of course , there are talks that are so unique they 're kind of out in the stratosphere , in their own special place , and we call that the colleen flanagan index .
so we 're using these network motifs to find talks that are unique , ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields , ones that are central to their topic , and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields .
sg : so that 's exactly right .
we 've got ourselves in a world that 's massively complex , and we 've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down so we can navigate through it .
and those algorithms , whilst being kind of useful , are also very , very narrow , and we can do better than that , because we can realize that their complexity is not random .
it has mathematical structure , and we can use that mathematical structure to go and explore things like the world of ideas to see what 's being said , to see what 's not being said , and to be a little bit more human and , hopefully , a little smarter .
thank you .
and there 's one solution that 's probably only a few years off .
so that 's one way of going about it .
what i think i 've been talking about really is success and failure .
bj : so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london .
so we began with a test .
the weight is really difficult when it 's up above your head .
we had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones .
bj : so we got a camera , and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances .
here i have an 18-second clip of the very first walk of the prototype .
the horses are completely handmade .
so here are some half-finished horses ready to be worked in london .
no , no , i have n't got it .
horses ' hearing is very important .
the way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it 's a convincing horse action .
so he made a channel in here , and the chest moves up and down in that channel .
and so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
they have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production .
and it 's very much an in-the-moment activity that they 're engaged in .
it 's three heads making one character .
today , i 'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics .
a conductive pen from the lewis lab at uiuc .
sticker templates .
making a switch .
adding some intelligence with a microcontroller .
sketching an interface .
but i want to tell you , i think it 's an important topic that we need to care about .
state budgets are big , big money — i 'll show you the numbers — and they get very little scrutiny .
many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are .
and these budgets are the key for our future ; they 're the key for our kids .
here 's the overall picture .
now out of that pie , the government spends 36 percent .
so this is combining the federal level , which is the largest , the state level and the local level .
simple business question .
answer is 26 percent .
and some of that , in fact , is due to the fact that we 've had an economic recession .
receipts go down , some spending programs go up , but most of it is not because of that .
most of it is because of ways that the liabilities are building up and the trends , and that creates a huge challenge .
in fact , this is the forecast picture .
there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more revenue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
this is what you see at this overall level .
now how did we get here ?
but what this means actually is that there 's a pretense .
there 's no real , true balancing going on , and in a sense , the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people do n't see things that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges .
that is , through various gimmicks and things , a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending .
so you get a big squeeze .
and these were somewhat noticed .
it perpetuates deficit spending .
this is so blatant , so extreme .
they make you pay more in withholding just to help their cash flow out .
and california 's not unique .
it really comes from the fact that certain long-term obligations — health care , where innovation makes it more expensive , early retirement and pension , where the age structure gets worse for you , and just generosity — that these mis-accounting things allow to develop over time , that you 've got a problem .
this is the retiree health care benefits .
well what 's going to give ?
well in order to accommodate that , you would have to cut education spending in half .
it really is this young versus the old to some degree .
the great university of california university system , the great things that have gone on , wo n't happen .
`` within the education community there 's this discussion of , `` '' should it just be the young teachers who get laid off , or the less good teachers who get laid off ? '' '' and there 's a discussion : if you 're going to increase class sizes , where do you do that ? how much effect does that have ? ''
in fact , no , education spending should not be cut .
there 's ways , if it 's temporary , to minimize the impact , but it 's a problem .
it 's also really a problem for where we need to go .
technology has a role to play .
well we need money to experiment with that , to get those tools in there .
there 's the idea of paying teachers for effectiveness , measuring them , giving them feedback , taking videos in the classroom .
or even if you 're flat , you might shift money into it .
so what 's going on ?
well there really is no brain trust .
just look at this spending .
california will spend over 100 billion , microsoft , 38 , google , about 19 .
no , they wasted their money on this . what about this thing ? — it really is quite phenomenal .
everybody has an opinion .
there 's great feedback .
so what do we need to do ?
we need better tools .
we can get some things out on the internet .
we need lots more .
there 's a few good books , one about school spending and where the money comes from — how that 's changed over time , and the challenge .
we need better accounting .
we need to take the fact that the current employees , the future liabilities they create , that should come out of the current budget .
we need to understand why they 've done the pension accounting the way they have .
it 's the gold standard .
and finally , we need to really reward politicians .
in fact , the week afterwards , some tax cuts were done that made the situation even worse than their assumptions .
so we need these pieces .
now i think this is a solvable problem .
it 's a great country with lots of people .
but we have to draw those people in , because this is about education .
and that 's the kind of thing — the investment in the young — that makes us great , allows us to contribute .
thank you .
( applause )
it started out as a cathartic exercise .
sexual assault , along with other kinds of injustices , is reported in the media all the time .
and that 's why the story was news .
but the campaign never meant to shame anyone .
divisive twitter trolls were quick to create even more injustice , commenting on my attacker 's ethnicity or class to push their own prejudiced agendas .
but i 've thought about this line a lot ever since .
with us , this was holding my attacker to account — and many others .
it was calling them out on the effect they had caused .
because sometimes these questions do n't have easy answers .
you can not build further walls by fighting injustice with more prejudice , more hatred .
let us hold people to account , without descending into a culture that thrives off shaming and injustice ourselves .
`` and i think there are few things more `` '' right '' '' in this world than bringing people together , than unions . ''
and if we allow social media to deliver that , then it can deliver a very powerful form of justice , indeed .
a father came out of his house to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk , to get home , finish their schoolwork , and prepare themselves for bed .
`` and as the father was administering these instructions , a car drove by , slowly , and just after it passed the father and the teenagers , a hand went out from the front passenger window , and — `` '' bam , bam ! '' '' — killing the father . ''
they considered all the usual culprits , and in less than 24 hours , they had selected their suspect : francisco carrillo , a 17-year-old kid who lived about two or three blocks away from where the shooting occurred .
`` they found photos of him . they prepared a photo array , and the day after the shooting , they showed it to one of the teenagers , and he said , `` '' that 's the picture . ''
`` that 's the shooter i saw that killed the father . '' '' that was all a preliminary hearing judge had to listen to , to bind mr. carrillo over to stand trial for a first-degree murder . ''
so what 's wrong ?
straightforward , fair trial , full investigation .
no vehicle was ever identified as being the one in which the shooter had extended his arm , and no person was ever charged with being the driver of the shooter 's vehicle .
and mr. carrillo 's alibi ?
sent to prison , adamantly insisting on his innocence , which he has consistently for 21 years .
so what 's the problem ?
under the best of observation conditions , the absolute best , we only detect , encode and store in our brains bits and pieces of the entire experience in front of us , and they 're stored in different parts of the brain .
it 's called reconstructed memories .
they retained me , as a forensic neurophysiologist , because i had expertise in eyewitness memory identification , which obviously makes sense for this case , right ?
well , what 's that got to do with this ?
all the teenagers testified during the trial that they could see very well .
but this occurred in mid-january , in the northern hemisphere , at 7 p.m. at night .
so when i did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at that location on earth at the time of the incident of the shooting , all right , it was well past the end of civil twilight and there was no moon up that night .
so all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here .
this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
remember , the investigating officers ' report said the lighting was good .
this is looking down to the east , where the shooting vehicle sped off , and this is the lighting directly behind the father and the teenagers .
no one 's going to call this well-lit , good lighting , and in fact , as nice as these pictures are , and the reason we take them is i knew i was going to have to testify in court , and a picture is worth more than a thousand words when you 're trying to communicate numbers , abstract concepts like lux , the international measurement of illumination , the ishihara color perception test values .
when you present those to people who are not well-versed in those aspects of science and that , they become salamanders in the noonday sun . it 's like talking about the tangent of the visual angle , all right ?
their eyes just glaze over , all right ?
so these are some of the pictures that , in fact , i used when i testified , but more importantly were , to me as a scientist , are those readings , the photometer readings , which i can then convert into actual predictions of the visual capability of the human eye under those circumstances , and from my readings that i recorded at the scene under the same solar and lunar conditions at the same time , so on and so forth , right , i could predict that there would be no reliable color perception , which is crucial for face recognition , and that there would be only scotopic vision ,
i testified to that to the court , and while the judge was very attentive , it had been a very , very long hearing for this petition for a retrial , and as a result , i noticed out of the corner of my eye that i thought that maybe the judge was going to need a little more of a nudge than just more numbers .
we had a car that came by , same identical car as described by the teenagers , right ?
now , he did n't use a real gun in his hand , so he had a black object in his hand that was similar to the gun that was described .
this is the car 30 feet away from the judge .
there 's an arm sticking out of the passenger side and pointed back at you .
some of the teenagers said that in fact the car was 15 feet away when it shot .
this judge is someone you 'd never want to play poker with .
`` i said , `` '' your honor , '' '' and i do n't know whether i was emboldened by the scientific measurements that i had in my pocket and my knowledge that they are accurate , or whether it was just sheer stupidity , which is what the defense lawyers thought — ( laughter ) — when they heard me say , `` '' yes , your honor , i want you stand right there and i want the car to go around the block again and i want it to come and i want it to stop right in front of you , three to four feet away , and i want the passenger to extend his hand ''
`` with a black object and point it right at you , and you can look at it as long as you want . '' '' and that 's what he saw . ( laughter ) you 'll notice , which was also in my test report , all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side , which means that the shooter 's face would have been photo-occluded . it would have been backlit . ''
why did i take the risk ?
three to four feet , it might as well have been a football field away .
this is what he saw .
he went back , there was a few more days of evidence that was heard . at the end of it , he made the judgment that he was going to grant the petition for a retrial .
which they decided not to .
he — his girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial , right ? and she had a little baby boy .
he and his son are both attending cal state , long beach right now taking classes . ( applause ) and what does this example — what 's important to keep in mind for ourselves ?
the opposing council always fight it and oppose it .
think about how we select our judges in this country .
the other one that i want to suggest , the caution that all of us have to have , i constantly have to remind myself , about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true , that we believe in ?
there is decades of research , examples and examples of cases like this , where individuals really , really believe . none of those teenagers who identified him thought that they were picking the wrong person .
none of them thought they could n't see the person 's face .
we all have to be very careful .
all our memories are reconstructed memories .
they 're dynamic .
they 're malleable . they 're volatile , and as a result , we all need to remember to be cautious , that the accuracy of our memories is not measured in how vivid they are nor how certain you are that they 're correct .
thank you . ( applause )
it 's permeable .
( music )
this was last wednesday afternoon at a school in brooklyn , new york , at cristo rey high school , run by the jesuits .
and i was talking to this group of students , and take a look at them .
it 's an old new york school building , nothing fancy .
and there are about 300 kids in this school , and the school 's been going now for four years , and they 're about to graduate their first class .
twenty-two people are graduating , and all 22 are going to college .
they all come from homes where there is , for the most part , just one person in the home , usually the mother or the grandmother , and that 's it , and they come here for their education and for their structure .
`` now i had this picture taken , and it was put up on my facebook page last week , and somebody wrote in , `` huh , why does he have him standing at attention like that ? '' ''
`` and then they said , `` '' but he looks good . '' '' ( laughter ) he does look good , because kids need structure , and the trick i play in all of my school appearances is that when i get through with my little homily to the kids , i then invite them to ask questions , and when they raise their hands , i say , `` '' come up , '' '' and i make them come up and stand in front of me . ''
i make them stand at attention like a soldier .
so people think i 'm being unkind to this kid .
no , we 're having a little fun .
and the thing about it , i 've done this for years , the younger they are , the more fun it is .
you know that they 'll always start yakking .
`` i say , `` '' now listen . in the army , when we want you to pay attention , we have a command . it 's called 'at ease . ' it means everybody be quiet and pay attention . listen up . ''
`` and i let them go for about 10 seconds , then i go , `` '' at ease ! '' '' `` `` huh ! '' '' ( laughter ) `` yes , general . yes , general . '' ''
try it with your kids . see if it works . ( laughter ) i do n't think so .
and we would bring them into the army , and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure , put them in ranks , make them all wear the same clothes , cut all their hair off so they look alike , make sure that they are standing in ranks .
we teach them how to go right face , left face , so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions .
it gives them structure .
and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately , the drill sergeant .
but then the most amazing thing happens over time .
i 'm your worst nightmare . i 'm your daddy and your mommy .
yeah , and then when i ask you a question , there are only three possible answers : yes , sir ; no , sir ; and no excuse , sir .
`` i 'm telling you you did n't shave . '' '' `` no excuse , sir . `` `` attaboy , you 're learning fast . '' ''
but you 'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure .
and you know what , they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant .
they come to respect him .
and so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children .
`` i spend a lot of time with youth groups , and i say to people , `` '' when does the education process begin ? '' '' we 're always talking about , `` '' let 's fix the schools . ''
`` let 's get it all online . '' '' that is n't the whole answer . it 's part of the answer . ''
but the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child 's heart and soul to begin with .
`` no , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother 's arms looks up at the mother and says , `` '' oh , this must be my mother . ''
oh yeah , when i do n't feel so good down there , she takes care of me .
`` it 's her language i will learn . '' '' and at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age , but by three months , that 's her . ''
and if the person doing it , whether it 's the mother or grandmother , whoever 's doing it , that is when the education process begins .
that 's when language begins .
that 's when love begins . that 's when structure begins .
`` that 's when you start to imprint on the child that `` '' you are special , you are different from every other child in the world . ''
`` and we 're going to read to you . '' '' a child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school . ''
this is the way children are raised properly .
and i watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they 're , much to the distress of my children , they are acting just like we did . you know ? you imprint them .
and that 's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school .
they act it out . they act it out , and they 're on their way to jail or they 're on their way to being dropouts .
it 's predictable .
i was privileged to have that kind of good start .
i was not a great student .
i have my entire new york city board of education transcript from kindergarten through college .
i wanted it when i was writing my first book .
and then i found rotc .
and so my whole life then was dedicated to rotc and the military .
and i say to young kids everywhere , as you 're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you , always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing , and when you find those two things together , man , you got it .
that 's what 's going on . and that 's what i found .
i 'd been there four and a half going on five years , and my grades were not doing particularly well , and i was in occasional difficulties with the administration .
`` look , he gets straight a 's in that but not in anything else . '' '' and so they said , `` '' look , let 's take his rotc grades and roll them into his overall gpa and see what happens . '' '' and they did , and it brought me up to 2.0 . ( laughter ) yep . ( laughter ) ( applause ) they said , `` '' it 's good enough for government work . ''
`` give him to the army . we 'll never see him again . we 'll never see him again . '' '' so they shipped me off to the army , and lo and behold , many years later , i 'm considered one of the greatest sons the city college of new york has ever had . ( laughter ) so , i tell young people everywhere , it ai n't where you start in life , it 's what you do with life that determines where you end up in life , and you are blessed to be living in a country that , no matter where you start , you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself , you believe in the society and the country , ''
if we do n't give that gift to each and every one of our kids , if we do n't invest at the earliest age , we 're going to be running into difficulties .
it 's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall and almost 50 percent of our minority population living in low-income areas , because they 're not getting the gift of a good start .
`` they stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame : `` '' do n't you shame this family . '' '' sometimes i would get in trouble , and my parents were coming home , and i was in my room waiting for what 's going to happen , and i would sit there saying to myself , `` '' okay , look , take the belt and hit me , but , god , do n't give me that 'shame the family ' bit again . '' '' it devastated me when my mother did that to me . ''
children need a network . children need to be part of a tribe , a family , a community .
they never left . ( laughter ) i , so help me god , i grew up walking those streets , and they were always there .
they never went to the bathroom . they never cooked . ( laughter ) they never did anything .
they kept us in play .
and they did n't care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general , and they never expected any generals in the family , as long as you got an education and then you got a job .
`` `` '' do n't give us any of that self-actualization stuff . ''
`` and then you can support us . that 's the role of you guys . '' '' and so , it 's so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families , all families . ''
and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people , and i 'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren , it 's not enough . you 've got to reach out and back and find kids like mr. cruz who can make it if you give them the structure , if you reach back and help , if you mentor , if you invest in boys and girls clubs , if you work with your school system , make sure it 's the best school system , and not just your kid 's school , but the school uptown in harlem , not just downtown montessori on the west side .
all of us have to have a commitment to do that .
and we 're not just investing in the kids .
and we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority .
we have to make sure they 're ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours , a country that is like no other , a country that amazes me every single day , a country that 's fractious . we 're always arguing with each other .
we touch every nation . every nation touches us .
we are a nation of immigrants .
one of the great stories i love to tell is about my love of going to my hometown of new york and walking up park avenue on a beautiful day and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world .
i even did it when i was secretary of state .
i 'd come out of my suite at the waldorf astoria — ( laughter ) — be walking up the street , and i would hit around 55th street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler .
but i got ta have my hot dog .
and the scene repeats itself so often .
`` i 'll go up and ask for my hot dog , and the guy will fix it , and as he 's finishing , he 'll say , `` '' i know you . i see you on television . ''
`` you 're , well , you 're general powell . '' '' `` yes , yes . `` `` oh ... `` i hand him the money . ''
so we are still that magnificent country , but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world , and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind .
( applause )
rm : it 's adaptable and remixable .
i also think that people love chicago more because the flag is so cool .
tk : a powerful symbol for san francisco .
( laughter ) i mean , it 's distinctive , i 'll give them that .
here 's why .
tk : i would simplify or stylize the phoenix .
we need to change the culture in our jails and prisons , especially for young inmates .
new york state is one of only two in the u.s .
but it all starts with the c.o.s .
they play the little high school kid games with each other .
they politic with one another .
so he punched me in my chest .
he kind of knocked the wind out of me .
i was n't impulsive , i did n't react right away , because i know this is their house .
i have no wins .
i tried to educate myself as much as possible .
and aside from that , i wrote music and short stories .
you get health insurance ? dental ?
growing up , i was always a good , smart kid .
some people would say i was a little too smart for my own good .
i would tell him not to be in such-and-such place .
it 's like fallujah . shooting everywhere .
and there is a major shift coming on the horizon .
government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
i remember standing on the roof of the ministry of justice in downtown port-au-prince .
it was about two meters high , completely squashed by the violence of the earthquake .
for those of us on the ground in those early days , it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans that haiti was something different .
haiti was something we had n't seen before .
this was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered .
and we were unprepared for this , and they were shaping the aid effort .
outside haiti also , things were looking different .
people that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress , were signaling their need for help .
on street sides all over port-au-prince , entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations .
we started talking with a local telecom provider called voilà , which is a subsidiary of trilogy international .
we wanted to communicate in a two-way form of communication .
we did n't want to shout ; we needed to listen as well .
we wanted to be able to target specific geographic communities .
and we wanted it to be easy to use .
out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera — the trilogy emergency response application — which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
it has been used to help communities prepare for disasters .
it 's used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera .
and it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender-based violence .
but does it work ?
96 percent of them found it useful .
83 percent of them took action — evidence that it is indeed empowering .
and 73 percent of them shared it .
the tera system was developed from haiti with support of engineers in the region .
it is a user-appropriate technology that has been used for humanitarian good to great effect .
the grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models , the old analog models of control and command .
one illustration of the transformational power of technology is in kibera .
if you were to arrive in nairobi today and pick up a tourist map , kibera is represented as a lush , green national park devoid of human settlement .
people like josh and steve are continuing to layer information upon information , real-time information , tweet it and text it onto these maps for all to use .
you can find out about the latest impromptu music session .
you can find out about the latest security incident .
you can find out about places of worship .
you can feel the dynamism of this living , breathing community .
they also have their own news network on youtube with 36,000 viewers at the moment .
they 're showing that the magic of technology can bring the invisible visible .
and they are giving a voice to themselves .
they are telling their own story , bypassing the official narrative .
and we 're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories .
in nigeria , open-source sms tools are being used by the red cross community workers to gather information from the local community in an attempt to better understand and mitigate the prevalence of malaria .
and not only is it empowering to the communities , but really importantly , this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices .
the u.n. broadband commission has recently set targets to help broadband access in 50 percent of the developing world , compared to 20 percent today .
a transformation is coming which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models .
we need to , for example , embrace the big data , the knowledge that is there from market leaders who understand what it means to use and leverage big data .
we now have the tools . we now have the possibilities .
there are no more reasons not to do it .
thank you very much .
( applause )
the musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this .
i find weather extremely fascinating .
i extract information from a specific environment using very low-tech data collecting devices — generally anything i can find in the hardware store .
i then compare my information to the things i find on the internet — satellite images , weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys .
that 's both historical as well as real data .
and then i compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here .
and from all of these numbers , i start with only two or three variables .
that begins my translation process .
a basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements .
that means that it is the numbers that control the form , not me .
when you step closer , you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers .
but it 's also used to assign a temperature range .
and musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it .
every single color , dot , every single line , is a weather element .
and together , these variables construct a score .
you place it in a science museum , it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data .
you place it in a music hall , it all of a sudden becomes a musical score .
and not everyone has a ph.d. in science .
thank you .
( applause )
you 'll find all the gold you want there .
could the boiling river exist ?
the river flowed hot and fast .
it was just part of their everyday life .
they drink its water .
one story was even featured in national geographic magazine .
pshh , pouring rain , could n't see a thing .
well , first off , it 's not a legend .
surprise !
and the results were just awesome .
it can be deadly .
so they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes .
what 's , again , amazing are these temperatures .
it 's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin , and again , over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center .
it 's unique .
but again , despite all of these studies , all of these discoveries and the legends , a question remains : what is the significance of the boiling river ?
what is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle ?
and what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend ?
to the shaman and his community , it 's a sacred site .
to me , as a geoscientist , it 's a unique geothermal phenomenon .
and the thing there is , we define significance .
it 's us . we have that power .
there remains so much to explore .
so go out .
be curious .
thank you very much .
but he did .
i did n't see him .
i guess he looked at all of us , as his hand hovered over the detonation switch .
i 've often wondered : what was he thinking ?
it allowed him to push that button .
and he was n't selective .
twenty-six precious lives were taken in my carriage alone , and i was almost one of them .
`` `` '' i 'm gill . i 'm here . ''
i 'm alive .
`` ok. '' '' `` '' i 'm gill . ''
i did n't know richard .
all i shared with them was my first name .
i do n't smoke cigarillos anymore .
i was a young australian woman doing extraordinary things in london .
and i was n't ready for that all to end .
i elevated my thighs .
perhaps i should have done more .
perhaps i could have lived more , seen more .
but my priority and my focus was always my work .
i lived to work .
but it did n't matter down in that tunnel .
i had done all i possibly could , and now i was in their hands .
those four words were my gift . what they told me very clearly
was that my life was saved , purely because i was a human being .
throughout all the chaos , my hand was held tightly .
i felt loved .
i was loved .
now : how much do you think the person sitting next to you gets paid ?
again , do n't answer out loud .
notice , it 's a little uncomfortable for me to even ask you those questions .
but admit it — you kind of want to know .
and what would happen if we removed that secrecy ?
and the answers keep surprising .
`` `` '' forbidding '' '' discussion among employees of salary received . ''
now that memo did n't sit well with everybody .
here 's why : first , most employees have no idea how their pay compares to their peers ' .
in a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees , two-thirds of everyone who is paid at the market rate said that they felt they were underpaid .
are you underpaid ?
next , information asymmetry , pay secrecy , makes it easier to ignore the discrimination that 's already present in the market today .
this is where that 77 cents on the dollar comes from .
if we really want to close the gender wage gap , maybe we should start by opening up the payroll .
if this is what total market failure looks like , then openness remains the only way to ensure fairness .
openness remains the best way to ensure fairness , and pay transparency does that .
and dane saw the strife that happened as a result of this .
now , pay transparency takes a lot of forms .
it 's not one size fits all .
some post their salaries for all to see .
some only keep it inside the company .
but we can all take greater steps towards pay transparency .
so how much do you get paid ?
you should know .
so let me try to illustrate their findings with an example .
that 's much better than everybody just thinking that you 're the cute girl next door .
now generally , it 's not advisable to just cash in and marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all .
because for me , equations and symbols are n't just a thing .
you now walk the same path as these early artists .
half a kilometer underground .
but this is not the europe we know today .
everything was different .
you become the president of the united states .
and she 's just turned 18 .
erick comes from the island of madagascar .
laetitia is one of our young leaders .
and i think of my work as almost an archaeology .
thank you .
and it turns out it really is a problem .
i call that a problem worth solving .
so what are those physics ?
let 's go back to drilling through a wall .
but then there 's that moment when the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall , and right at that moment the wall ca n't push back anymore .
but your brain has n't reacted to that change in force .
that 's what i set out to do .
right there .
but it did n't always look like this .
it took about 30 minutes to do this , but it worked .
`` bassem was also struggling in egypt , and he said to doaa , `` '' let 's go to europe ; seek asylum , safety . ''
there were families on that boat , crammed together shoulder to shoulder , feet to feet .
day three , doaa had a premonition .
`` and she said to bassem , `` '' i fear we 're not going to make it . ''
`` i fear the boat is going to sink . '' '' and bassem said to her , `` '' please be patient . ''
`` and she heard how they yelled , `` let the fish eat your flesh ! '' ''
and they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank .
around them there were corpses .
so now they were three , doaa , bassem and little malek .
millions of refugees are living in exile , in limbo .
even if they wanted to return , they ca n't .
there are simply not enough schools , water systems , sanitation .
and days have turned into months , months into years .
it was their second day , and bassem was getting very weak .
later that day , a mother came up to doaa with her small 18-month-old daughter , masa .
`` let her be part of you . i will not survive . '' '' and then she went away and drowned . ''
around them , the bodies were bloating and turning black .
the sun was blazing during the day .
and then the news cycle moved on .
meanwhile , in a pediatric hospital on crete , little masa was on the edge of death .
she was really dehydrated . her kidneys were failing .
and doaa ? well , word went around about her survival , too .
but she wants to still go to sweden .
but i have to ask : what if she did n't have to take that risk ?
why was n't there a legal way for her to study in europe ?
the world did this for the vietnamese in the 1970s . why not now ?
well , that is largely europe 's choice .
people are worried about their security , their economies , the changes of culture .
but is that more important than saving human lives ?
could we be inspired by what happened , and take a stand for a world in which every life matters ?
`` sadly , the frequent overuse of the word `` '' awesome '' '' has now replaced words like `` '' great '' '' and `` '' thank you . '' '' so webster 's dictionary defines the word `` '' awesome '' '' as fear mingled with admiration or reverence , a feeling produced by something majestic . ''
now , with that in mind , was your quiznos sandwich awesome ?
the answer is no , no and no .
ladies and gentlemen , here are 10 things that are truly awesome .
the wheel , ladies and gentlemen .
pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone .
yes , the grand canyon is .
i mean , come on . is photography awesome ?
did you eat food today ? did you eat ?
but it 's not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower , although that would be awesome .
( laughter ) bees are awesome . are you kidding me ?
landing on the moon ! come on !
woodstock , 1969 : rolling stone magazine said this changed the history of rock and roll .
tickets were only 24 dollars back then .
was woodstock awesome ? yes , it was awesome .
some sharks can lose 30,000 teeth in their lifetime .
does awesome inspire fear ?
oh , hell yeah , sharks are awesome !
and finally , finally some of you ca n't wait to come up and tell me how awesome my powerpoint was .
i understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago , when my wife and i became new parents .
but sometimes we speak up when we should n't , and i learned that over 10 years ago when i let my twin brother down .
but as a negotiations researcher , i insisted he make a counteroffer , and i helped him craft the perfect one .
and it was perfect — it was perfectly insulting .
and the range of stories are varied and diverse , but they also make up a universal tapestry .
can i confront my coworker who keeps stepping on my toes ?
now , sometimes we 're too strong ; we push ourselves too much .
even making an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior .
that 's what happened with my wife and i .
we get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized .
or we lose that raise or that promotion or that deal .
now , the first thing we need to know is : what is my range ?
but the key thing is , our range is n't fixed ; it 's actually pretty dynamic .
and there 's one thing that determines that range more than anything else , and that 's your power .
your power determines your range .
what is power ?
sometimes it 's being new to a country , like an immigrant , or new to an organization or new to an experience , like my wife and i as new parents .
sometimes it 's in relationships , where one person 's more invested than the other person .
we have a lot of leeway in how to behave .
we have very little leeway .
the low-power double bind happens when , if we do n't speak up , we go unnoticed , but if we do speak up , we get punished .
`` now , many of you have heard the phrase the `` '' double bind '' '' and connected it with one thing , and that 's gender . ''
and the key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up , but they have barriers to doing so .
and the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range , and we lack power .
the first : you seem powerful in your own eyes .
the second : you seem powerful in the eyes of others .
when i feel powerful , i feel confident , not fearful ; i expand my own range .
and i 'm going to give you a set of tools today .
speaking up is risky , but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up .
the first tool i 'm going to give you got discovered in negotiations in an important finding .
on average , women make less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table .
but hannah riley bowles and emily amanatullah have discovered there 's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious .
that 's when they advocate for others .
`` this is sometimes called `` '' the mama bear effect . '' '' like a mama bear defending her cubs , when we advocate for others , we can discover our own voice . ''
but sometimes , we have to advocate for ourselves .
and perspective-taking is really simple : it 's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person .
but here 's the problem : perspective-taking is hard to do .
so let 's do a little experiment .
and i want you to draw a capital letter e on your forehead as quickly as possible .
i 'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an e on their forehead — my former student , erika hall .
i drew the e so it looks like an e to another person .
but this e over here is the self-focused e .
i want to tell you about a particular crisis .
he asked for a specific amount of money .
or option b : $ 23,000 and a three-year warranty .
and this does n't just work with salespeople ; it works with parents .
this pant or that pant ? ok , that pant .
so we want to get allies on our side .
when we advocate for others , we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others , but we also earn strong allies .
another way we can earn strong allies , especially in high places , is by asking other people for advice .
and this really works to solve another double bind .
and if we do , we 're not likable .
and three , it still worked !
we only need good evidence .
and one of the ways we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion .
`` i 've had people do this all over the world and i asked them , `` '' what did you notice about the other person when they described their passion ? '' '' and the answers are always the same . ''
`` ( laughter ) `` they leaned in as if telling me a secret . '' ''
both men and women get punished at work when they shed tears .
but lizzie wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion , the condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women .
here 's a picture of us .
`` and he said , `` '' the lighter your touch , the better you become at improving and enriching your performance . ''
those who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance grow , change and expand the self .
`` play it well , and your days will be mostly joyful . '' '' what my dad was saying is that we 've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world . ''
but he was also saying the essence of this talk : those roles and ranges are constantly expanding and evolving .
and if you use those tools — and each and every one of you can use these tools — you will expand your range of acceptable behavior , and your days will be mostly joyful .
thank you .
in 1991 i had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life .
i was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
`` it was just extraordinary , and when i came back home i found a poem by the mexican poet octavio paz , and decided to set it to music , a piece for choir called `` '' cloudburst , '' '' which is the piece that we 'll perform for you in just a moment . ''
( music ) and we released to youtube this , the virtual choir project , 185 singers from 12 different countries .
you can see my little video there conducting these people , alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home .
( music ) and when i was speaking to chris about the future of virtual choir and where we might be able to take this , he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could .
could we have people singing together in real time ?
i 'm joined by singers from cal state long beach , cal state fullerton and riverside community college , some of the best amateur choirs in the country , and — ( applause ) — and in the second half of the piece , the virtual choir will join us , 30 different singers from 30 different countries .
now , we 've pushed the technology as far as it can go , but there 's still less than a second of latency , but in musical terms , that 's a lifetime .
thank you .
it 's morning , before the match .
but there 's a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening .
if you look close , it 's this shape , called a crane .
every japanese kid learns how to fold that crane .
and where it has led in origami is to things like this .
they have to obey four simple laws .
so that 's four simple laws . that 's all you need in origami .
i could use that for a leg , an arm , anything like that .
what paper went into that flap ?
well , there are other ways of making a flap .
or you could do a moose .
actually , lots of people in origami now put toes into their models .
toes have become an origami meme , because everyone 's doing it .
but i want to show you some examples .
everything you 'll see here , except the car , is origami .
and i want to show you some of these examples .
now , there is actually a little origami in the james webb space telescope , but it 's very simple .
but if you want to go higher and go larger than this , then you might need some origami .
they called it the eyeglass .
so you have to do something like this .
this was a small model .
now , there is other origami in space .
and this example is the latter .
so they need to figure out how , in a computer , to flatten an airbag .
`` `` all right , but you 're going to go in full time once you graduate . '' ''
`` `` not exactly . we 've all lined up backup jobs . '' ''
why was i so wrong ?
and they look nothing like i expected .
( laughter ) so this started early : when i was a kid , i took nintendo games very seriously .
i would wake up at 5am , start playing and not stop until i had mastered them .
eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of nintendo , starring me .
so i challenged her to get some data .
so i want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators .
`` she was like , `` '' i do n't know . they did n't fill out my survey . '' '' ( laughter ) no , here are our results . ''
and on the flip side , the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they do n't have original thoughts either .
there 's a sweet spot where originals seem to live .
to find out , we designed some experiments .
and some of them are asked to do the task right away .
others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes .
`` as aaron sorkin put it , `` you call it procrastinating . i call it thinking . '' ''
take leonardo da vinci .
what about martin luther king , jr. ?
look at google , waiting for years after altavista and yahoo .
you just have to be different and better .
they had backup plans lined up , and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original , because i expected that originals would look something like this .
and so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four .
because if you use internet explorer or safari , those came preinstalled on your computer , and you accepted the default option that was handed to you .
it 's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that ca n't get the green light for more than half a century .
but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense .
originals feel fear , too .
you are not going to get judged on your bad ideas .
but guess what ? originals have lots and lots of bad ideas , tons of them , in fact .
take the guy who invented this .
no . you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb .
now , you may be wondering , how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot ?
i do n't know how wagner pulled that off .
so if you put all this together , what you see is that originals are not that different from the rest of us .
they have bad ideas .
and sometimes , it 's not in spite of those qualities but because of them that they succeed .
look , being original is not easy , but i have no doubt about this : it 's the best way to improve the world around us .
( applause )
okay , here we go .
those machines have no place for empathy .
i am a reformed marketer , and i now work in international development .
in october , i spent some time in the democratic republic of congo , which is the [ second ] largest country in africa .
in fact , it 's as large as western europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
the drc is a dangerous place .
but war is n't the only reason that life is difficult in the drc .
this might not sound like a large number , but in a country with 76 million people , it means there are 930,000 that are infected .
which is why , in part , donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost .
and so while i was in the drc , i spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms , including damien .
it 's not surprising , because only three percent of people in the drc use condoms .
joseph and christine , who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms , said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost , and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them , their customers do n't buy the branded versions .
they like the generics .
and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like .
they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv , put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom .
( laughter ) what is it that you think about just before you get a condom ?
and the private companies that sell condoms in these places , they understand this .
their marketing is slightly different .
some brands are aspirational , and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative .
and this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing : understanding who 's the audience .
and for donor agencies , unfortunately , the audience tends to be people that are n't even in the country they 're working [ in ] .
it 's people back home , people that support their work , people like these .
but if what we 're really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv , we need to think about the customer , the people whose behavior needs to change — the couples , the young women , the young men — whose lives depend on it .
and so the lesson is this : it does n't really matter what you 're selling ; you just have to think about who is your customer , and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .
it might just save their lives .
( applause )
but until recently , we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe .
and i called it the zimbabwe institute of vigital arts .
and typography 's a very important part of the curriculum and we encourage our students to look inward for influence .
`` here 's a poster designed by one of the students under the theme `` '' education is a right . '' '' some logos designed by my students . ''
the different types of writing in africa , first was proto-writing , as illustrated by nsibidi , which is the writing system of a secret society of the ejagham people in southern nigeria .
so it 's a special-interest writing system .
it 's called sankofa .
this pictograph by the jokwe people of angola tells the story of the creation of the world .
all the paths lead to and from god .
in the rainforests of the democratic republic of congo , in the ituri society , the men pound out a cloth out of a special tree , and the women , who are also the praise singers , paint interweaving patterns that are the same in structure as the polyphonic structures that they use in their singing — a sort of a musical score , if you may .
king ibrahim njoya of the bamum kingdom of cameroon developed shü-mom at the age of 25 .
and here we see three stages of development that it went through in 30 years .
this ethiopic cross illustrates what dr. ron eglash has established : that africa has a lot to contribute to computing and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals .
africans of antiquity created civilization , and their monuments , which still stand today , are a true testimony of their greatness .
most probably , one of humanity 's greatest achievements is the invention of the alphabet , and that has been attributed to mesopotamia with their invention of cuneiform in 1600 bc , followed by hieroglyphics in egypt , and that story has been cast in stone as historical fact .
that is , until 1998 , when one yale professor john coleman darnell discovered these inscriptions in the thebes desert on the limestone cliffs in western egypt , and these have been dated at between 1800 and 1900 b.c. , centuries before mesopotamia .
called wadi el-hol because of the place that they were discovered , these inscriptions — research is still going on , a few of them have been deciphered , but there is consensus among scholars that this is really humanity 's first alphabet .
it is time that students of design in africa read the works of titans like cheikh anta diop , senegal 's cheikh anta diop , whose seminal work on egypt is vindicated by this discovery .
it is also time that designers in africa stop looking outside .
they 've been looking outward for a long time , yet what they were looking for has been right there within grasp , right within them .
so , 27 years ago i got a traffic ticket that got me thinking .
i 've had some time to think it over .
road design makes a difference , particularly intersections , of which there are two types : signalized and unsignalized , which means stop signs .
roundabouts are much better .
a study of 24 intersections has found crashes drop 40 percent from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout .
injury crashes have dropped 76 percent , fatal crashes down 90 percent .
but that 's just safety .
they 're expensive to install , but they are more expensive not to . so , we should look at that .
but the other two are somewhat questionable .
so , here 's one . there 's another one which i studied .
cars rarely appear on that third road .
and so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
that 's just the gasoline cost . there is also pollution , wear on the car , and time .
is $ 20 an hour . that is 60,000 per year .
discount that back to the present , at five percent : over two million dollars for a stop sign , in each direction .
and you 'd still come out ahead .
because it is saving lives . so , is there a better way to accomplish that goal ?
because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they 're waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars are n't slowing down on the main road .
can that be accomplished with existing signs ?
so , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .
`` you could n't suddenly tell everyone , `` '' ok , remember what you used to do at yield signs ? now do something different . '' '' that would not work . ''
so , what the world needs now is a new type of sign .
it 's kind of shaped like a t , as in taking turns .
( laughter ) do n't wait for that sign to be adopted , these things do n't change quickly .
and you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle . thank you very much .
alois did n't know how to help auguste , but he watched over her until , sadly , she passed away in 1906 .
and auguste deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call alzheimer 's disease .
since 1901 , medicine has advanced greatly .
we 've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections , many treatments for cancer , antiretrovirals for hiv , statins for heart disease and much more .
but we 've made essentially no progress at all in treating alzheimer 's disease .
but by 2050 , it will affect 150 million people — which , by the way , will include many of you .
in other words , odds are you 'll spend your golden years either suffering from alzheimer 's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with alzheimer 's .
one out of every five medicare dollars get spent on alzheimer 's .
it is today the most expensive disease , and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050 , as the baby boomer generation ages .
but we 've done relatively little to address it .
the lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause : a lack of awareness .
but we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an alzheimer 's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease .
remember dr. alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in auguste 's brain a century ago .
for almost a century , we did n't know much about these .
that 's what we see in the brains of alzheimer 's patients .
we 've spent the past 10 years at the university of cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works .
there are many steps , and identifying which step to try to block is complex — like defusing a bomb .
cutting one wire might do nothing .
we have to find the right step to block , and then create a drug that does it .
now let me show you some of our latest results .
let 's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms .
and you can see they 're clearly sick .
this is just an initial positive result , but research like this shows us that alzheimer 's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure .
but to grow that hope , to finally beat alzheimer 's , we need help .
in the case of other diseases , patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments , the pharmaceutical industry , scientists and regulators .
today , we see that same drive to beat cancer .
but alzheimer 's patients are often unable to speak up for themselves .
so , it really is down to you .
everyone with a brain is at risk .
help speak up for them , and help demand a cure .
and so with this solution , what does this mean for the world ?
together , we can build the future today .
thanks .
( applause )
so in the process , i start thinking , well what else might they know about me ?
but after going through this , after realizing , well what just happened ?
so sometimes the databases get so specific .
not really sure why they show up , but they do .
when i was in elementary school , my next door neighbor , he gave me a book for my birthday .
it was an astronomy book , and i poured over that thing for hours on end , and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream , and part of that dream was , i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft .
well , a number of years later , i graduated from ucla and i found myself at nasa , working for the jet propulsion laboratory , and there our team was challenged to create a 3d visualization of the solar system , and today i want to show you what we 've done so far .
you can see the united states and california and san diego , and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around .
google earth goes from this view down to your backyard .
we go from this view out to the stars .
so the earth is cool , but what we really want to show are the spacecraft , so i 'm going to bring the interface back up , and now you 're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the earth .
if we did , it would be a complete mess , because there 's a lot of stuff out there .
and the cool thing is , we actually created 3d models for a number of these spacecraft , so if you want to visit any of these , all you need to do is double-click on them .
so i 'm going to find the international space station , double-click , and it will take us all the way down to the iss .
well , i can click on this home button over here , and that will take us up to the inner solar system , and now we 're looking at the rest of the solar system .
it 's actually pretty busy .
here we have juno on its cruise to jupiter , there .
and i mention this because there 's this strange public perception that nasa 's dead , that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there 's no more spacecraft out there .
well , a lot of what nasa does is robotic exploration , and we have a lot of spacecraft out there .
anyway , while we 're here , again , if you want to visit anything , all you need to do is double-click .
i 'm going to double-click on uranus , and we can see uranus rotating on its side along with its moons .
we 're now riding along with voyager 1 .
now , there 's a funny thing going on here .
it looks like i 've paused the program .
it 's actually running at real rate right now , one second per second , and in fact , voyager 1 here is flying by titan at i think it 's 38,000 miles per hour .
it only looks like nothing 's moving because , well , saturn here is 700,000 miles away , and titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away .
it 's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing 's happening .
and i 'm going to recenter the camera on saturn , here .
there 's a point to be made here .
with a 3d visualization like this , we can not only just say voyager 1 flew by saturn .
and even better , because it 's an interactive application , you can tell the story for yourself .
if you want to pause it , you can pause it .
if you want to keep going , if you want to change the camera angle , you can do that , and because of that , i can show you that voyager 1 does n't just fly by saturn .
and , in fact , i 'm going to go back to the solar system .
i 'm going to go back to today , now , and i want to show you where voyager 1 is .
right there , above , way above the solar system , way beyond our solar system .
and here 's the thing . now you know how it got there .
now you know why , and to me , that 's the point of this program .
and my personal dream is for kids to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired , as i was as a kid , to pursue stem education and to pursue a dream in space exploration .
so , he 's discovering the garden .
very simple at the start .
you order an airline ticket ; you end up in timbuktu .
so we 've tackled that problem , and we 've come up with a solution , which we 'll see in a second .
when you see the microphone , say ... ( pm : squash . ) ... yes to decide .
pm : no . that 's the wrong thing to do .
pm : okay . so what we 're going to do now is teach milo to skim stones .
we 're actually teaching him .
it 's very , very interesting that men , more than women , tend to be more competitive here .
okay , this is skimming stones .
pm : so after three-quarters of an hour , he recognizes you .
some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side .
my travels to afghanistan began many , many years ago on the eastern border of my country , my homeland , poland .
i was walking through the forests of my grandmother 's tales .
i met humble people .
i heard their prayer and ate their bread .
then i have been walking east for 20 years — from eastern europe to central asia — through the caucasus mountains , middle east , north africa , russia .
and i ever met more humble people .
and i shared their bread and their prayer .
and i understood that his surprise was my protection .
my only weapon was my notebook and my leica .
i heard prayers of the sufi — humble muslims , hated by the taliban .
hidden river , interconnected with the mysticism from gibraltar to india .
what do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect , about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium ?
these are opium-addicted people on the roofs of kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
these are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for afghan businessmen .
what do we know about the women 10 years after the war ?
i saw one day , the largest school in afghanistan , a girls ' school .
what do we know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in balkh ?
thanks .
( applause )
have you heard the news ?
what about germany ?
and that 's just the start of it .
say we want to get to 100 gigawatts by 2022 .
during a year , a single plant can provide power 92 percent of the time .
even oil is more popular than nuclear .
you know how you 've got 10 years where you 're demonstrating that reactor ?
in other words : we 're not in a clean energy revolution ; we 're in a clean energy crisis .
thank you very much .
in 1975 , i met in florence a professor , carlo pedretti , my former professor of art history , and today a world-renowned scholar of leonardo da vinci .
well , in the mid-'70s , there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me , especially in italy , and so i decided , with some researchers from the united states and the university of florence , to start probing the murals decorated by vasari on the long walls of the hall of the 500 searching for the lost leonardo .
well , this time , we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the hall of the 500 was before the remodeling , and the so-called sala grande , which was built in 1494 , and to find out the original doors , windows , and in order to do that , we first created a 3d model , and then , with thermography , we went on to discover hidden windows . these are the original windows of the hall of the sala grande . we also found out about the height of the ceiling , and we managed to reconstruct , therefore , all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came vasari ,
one that we [ see ] here , masaccio , the church of santa maria novella in florence , so we just said , well maybe , visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo , since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci .
and so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap .
well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . many political reasons .
so i decided to go back to my alma mater , and , at the university of california , san diego , and i proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage .
we came back in the hall of the 500 in 2011 , and this time , with a great group of students , and my colleague , professor falko kuester , who is now the director at cisa3 , and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left .
well , we were confined though , limited , i should rather say , for several reasons that it 's not worth explaining , to endoscopy only , of the many other options we had , and with a 4mm camera attached to it , we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color , black color , and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams , xrf , x-ray diffraction , and the results are very positive so far . it seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments , and since we know for sure
well , we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind .
i had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me , but basically to do what ? well , to assess , for example , the state of conservation . see here the face of the madonna of the chair that when just shining a uv light on it you suddenly see another , different lady , aged lady , i should rather say .
but also , technology has helped to write new pages of our history , or at least to update pages of our histories .
`` for example , the `` '' lady with the unicorn , '' '' another painting by rafael , well , you see the unicorn . ''
a lot has been said and written about the unicorn , but if you take an x-ray of the unicorn , it becomes a puppy dog .
`` otto marseus , nice painting , which is `` '' still life '' '' at the pitti gallery , and just have an infrared camera peering through , and luckily for art historians , it just was confirmed that there is a signature of otto marseus . it even says when it was made and also the location . ''
so that was a good result . sometimes , it 's not that good , and so , again , authenticity and science could go together and change the way , not attributions being made , but at least lay the ground for a more objective , or , i should rather say , less subjective attribution , as it is done today .
`` but i would say the discovery that really caught my imagination , my admiration , is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer , brown layer , of `` '' the adoration of the magi . '' '' here you see a handmade setting xyz scanner with an infrared camera put on it , and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath . ''
well , this happens to be the most important painting we have in italy by leonardo da vinci , and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries . look at these portraits .
they 're magnificent . you see leonardo at work .
you see the geniality of his creation , right directly on the ground layer of the panel , and see this cool thing , finding , i should rather say , an elephant . ( laughter ) because of this elephant , over 70 new images came out , never seen for centuries .
this was an epiphany . we came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by leonardo da vinci , which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see , so thanks only to technology .
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet . let me show you just simulating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
and we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see , like this .
okay ? and i will just click on it , we pause , and now let me turn to you so the moment the image , or , i should say , the camera , has locked in the painting , then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded . and so , see .
so all we need is one finger . just wipe off and we see the elephant . ( applause ) ( applause ) okay ? and then if we want , we can continue the scroll to find out , for example , on the staircase , the whole iconography is going to be changed . there are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple , and there are a lot of figures showing up . see ?
and if you want to summarize in one just single word , well , this is what we 're trying to do .
we 're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future .
as long as we live a life of curiosity and passion , there is a bit of leonardo in all of us . thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
now , i do n't know about you , but i do n't buy that .
they have to find a cure , and if they can not find a cure , he will die .
so they can not try that many things .
something 's got ta be working up there .
and then three months later , again we get bad news .
ehud is going into his third treatment , and then his fourth treatment .
and then , as predicted , ehud dies .
i was just outraged that , how come this is the best that we can offer ?
you 'll see lung cancer , for example , on the rise .
and you 'll also see that , for example , stomach cancer once used to be one of the biggest killers of all cancers , is essentially eliminated .
now , why is that ? anyone knows , by the way ?
was it maybe a new drug , or a better diagnostic ?
so the best thing that happened to us so far in the medical arena in cancer research is the fact that the refrigerator was invented .
i do n't want to miniaturize the progress and everything that 's been done in cancer research .
again , i will argue that the primary reason why this is the case , why we have not done that remarkably well , is really we 're fighting blindly here .
and so to give you a sense of the best medical imaging that 's offered today to brain cancer patients , or actually generally to all cancer patients , take a look at this pet scan right here .
you 'll see that the heart , for example , lights up there .
that 's because the heart needs a lot of sugar .
you 'll also see that the bladder lights up there .
`` for the first time it allowed us to look into someone 's body without picking up each and every one of the cells and putting them under the microscope , but in a noninvasive way allowing us to look into someone 's body and ask , `` '' hey , has the cancer metastasized ? ''
can anyone guess how many cancer cells are in any one of these tumors ?
then you take out your knife and start cutting the tumor piece by piece by piece .
`` and as you 're taking the tumor out , then you 're getting to a stage where you think , `` alright , i 'm done . i took out everything . '' ''
`` and so i remember talking to a few friends of mine in the lab , and we say , `` '' boy , there 's got to be a better way . '' '' but not just like you tell a friend that there 's got to be a better way . ''
this is just incredible .
and so we looked back .
we said , hey , how about instead of using sugar molecules , let 's maybe take tiny , tiny little particles made of gold , and let 's program them with some interesting chemistry around them .
let 's program them to look for cancer cells .
and so we 've tested that , and boy , this works well .
`` the nice thing is that these gold particles actually made it all the way to the tumor , and then they shine out and tell us , `` '' hey , we 're here . here 's the tumor . '' '' so now we can see the tumor , but we 're not showing this to the doctor yet . ''
we 're asking the doctor , now please start cutting away the tumor , and you 'll see here the doctor just took the first quadrant of the tumor and you see that first quadrant is now missing .
the ability like this would allow us to actually pick up tumors way , way earlier in the process , way before it 's 100 million cells inside , so we can actually do something about it .
( applause )
i saw forests and meadows .
these were the ones i 'd like to draw — all variations of four legs and fur .
but instead , we stick a camera in the deep ocean , and we see a fish , and it does n't capture our imagination as a society .
or take this sea cucumber .
or take this swordfish .
could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose ?
so with characters , you can make stories .
then he meets the yeti crab , the famous vampire squid — elusive , hard to find — and the dumbo octopus , which looks so much like a cartoon in real life that really did n't have to change a thing when i drew it .
i felt shy , i felt embarrassed .
because what can you do with that data ?
you could abuse it .
so , let 's make it right in our own backyard .
as a kid , i would puzzle over questions just like this .
but there 's not .
so , i 'm still a skeptical little kid .
it 's a 27-kilometer tunnel on the border of france and switzerland buried 100 meters underground .
and then , we collide protons quadrillions of times , and we collect this data very slowly , over months and months .
so june 2015 , the lhc is switched back on .
so after a few months , we presented our little bump to the world with a very clear message : this little bump is interesting but it 's not definitive , so let 's keep an eye on it as we take more data .
so we were trying to be extremely cool about it .
people said it reminded them of the little bump that was shown on the way toward the higgs boson discovery .
they 're very expensive .
events where only two photons hit out detector are very rare .
gravity may seem super strong to you , but it 's actually crazily weak compared to the other forces of nature .
i can briefly beat gravity when i jump , but i ca n't pick a proton out of my hand .
but one theoretical explanation proposes a wild solution .
you and i — even you in the back — we live in three dimensions of space .
i hope that 's a non-controversial statement .
in fact , a particle is just another name for an excitation in a three-dimensional field ; a localized wobbling in space .
but math is math , and we can play around with our math however we want .
i see the looks on your faces .
and this hypothetical , extra-dimensional graviton is one of the only possible , hypothetical new particles that has the special quantum properties that could give birth to our little , two-photon bump .
particle physicists are explorers .
and very much of what we do is cartography .
let me put it this way : forget about the lhc for a second .
new particles can either show up immediately as big , obvious-to-spot bumps , or they can only reveal themselves after years of data taking .
planning is already underway for a 100-kilometer tunnel
that will collide particles at 10 times the energy of the lhc .
we will be forced to think in completely new ways .
we 'll have to go back to our assumptions , and determine if there was a flaw somewhere .
which would not be the end of physics , but a novel beginning .
thank you .
( applause )
let 's have a discussion .
what is , or should be , the intrinsic motivation ?
ms : to learn . hm : to get to know the world .
it 's really a question of how we want to live together .
do we want a society where everything is up for sale , or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money can not buy ?
thank you very much .
( laughter ) ( applause ) sound familiar ?
nope .
well i 'm here to suggest there 's a better way , that less might actually equal more .
whatever it was for you , i bet that , among other things , this gave you a little more freedom , a little more time .
it 's actually a great way to save you some money .
so i started a project called life edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area .
i wanted it all — home office , sit down dinner for 10 , room for guests , and all my kite surfing gear .
by buying a space that was 420 sq . ft .
instead of 600 , immediately i 'm saving 200 grand .
smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities — save some more money there , but also a smaller footprint .
and because it 's really designed around an edited set of possessions — my favorite stuff — and really designed for me , i 'm really excited to be there .
so how can you live little ?
three main approaches .
we 've got to clear the arteries of our lives .
we 've got to cut the extraneous out of our lives , and we 've got to learn to stem the inflow .
we need to think before we buy .
but we want stuff that we 're going to love for years , not just stuff .
secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
we want space efficiency .
why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
finally , we want multifunctional spaces and housewares — a sink combined with a toilet , a dining table becomes a bed — same space , a little side table stretches out to seat 10 .
in the winning life edited scheme in a render here , we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space .
my office folds away , easily hidden .
my bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
and of course , my own movie theater .
go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
most of us , maybe all of us , are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags , maybe a small space , a hotel room .
so let 's make room for the good stuff .
but here 's what really perplexed me .
( applause )
this is after selective logging .
the static-like sounds that are very low , that you 're going to hear right now .
and while a picture may be worth 1,000 words , a soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures .
and then there was me , the iranian-american of the group .
and that can be seen directly through a microscope , and i 'm going to show you some of this today .
but to really see the details of the bee , and really appreciate what it is , you have to look a little bit closer .
it 's about a tenth of a millimeter .
so if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower , what would that flower look like , if the flower was this big ?
there 's the stamen and the pistil . but look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope . that 's the stamen .
i want to talk about something really ordinary , just ordinary sand .
so sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
but when you look closer at this , look at what 's there .
it 's really quite amazing . you have microshells there .
you have things like coral .
you have fragments of other shells . you have olivine .
and the reason that is , is because in a place like this island , a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow , and when they die , their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand , things like coral and so forth .
we do n't realize it , but it 's actually a record of that entire ecology .
here 's what most of the sand in our world looks like .
these are quartz crystals and feldspar , so most sand in the world on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar . it 's the erosion of granite rock .
every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere .
and you can see those in micrometeorites .
and i started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes .
now , the moon has no atmosphere , so micrometeorites come in continuously , and the whole surface of the moon is covered with powder now , because for four billion years it 's been bombarded by micrometeorites , and when micrometeorites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour , they vaporize on contact .
and you can see here that that is — that 's sort of vaporized , and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together .
now here 's a grain of sand that is from the moon , and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there .
so what i 've been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look closely and if you look from a different and a new point of view .
it 's threatening the very underpinnings of our society .
and here 's how you 'll see .
we 're literally off the chart .
none of those are on my bucket list .
`` in all fairness , when i started writing this , i thought , `` oh wow , what does my company , what does tudor do ? '' ''
capitalism has to be based on justice .
( laughter ) but i 'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs , so i pretty much know everything there is .
now , i 'm sure you recognize this object ; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at los angeles international airport over the past couple of days .
this is known as the theme building ; that is its name for reasons that are still very murky .
and it is perhaps the best example we have in los angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture .
it is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located , of course , at stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design , the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously , the much better access to parking .
after all , the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often , preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls .
( applause ) ( music ) ah yes , a table .
we use these every day .
this is a design by philippe starck , who i believe is in the audience at this very moment .
( laughter ) it is a design that challenges your intuition — it is not what you think it is when you first see it .
it is not a fork designed to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time , which would be useful out in the lobby , i would say .
and despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism , it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts .
you can take it home with you , unlike the theme building , which will stay where it is forever .
it looks terrible . is it a little hot plate ?
no , i have an iphone . of course i do .
i do so many things on this little device .
i like to read books on it .
i use it every day to measure the weight of an ox , for example .
and yet i forget about it all the time .
it is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life .
unlike the theme building , this is not alien technology .
or i should say , what it did was it took technology which , unlike people in this room , to many other people in the world , still feels very alien , and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate .
and unlike the juicy salif , it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain , rather , it simply attaches itself to your brain .
( laughter ) and you did n't even notice it happened .
i just explained design .
thank you very much .
( applause )
which one do you choose if you want to do the right thing by the environment ?
most people do pick the paper .
therefore , it must be good for the environment .
in some cases , it 's recyclable .
but people are often not thinking of something like this , which is the other end of the spectrum .
and environmental folklore is a really important thing because we 're trying to do the right thing .
so we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face .
and we 've busted a bunch of myths .
allow me to explain .
when something natural , something that 's made from a cellulose fiber like a piece of bread , even , or any food waste , or even a piece of paper , when something natural ends up in the natural environment , it degrades normally .
in fact , here in the u.s. , 40 percent of food purchased for the home is wasted .
that 's the latest u.n. stats . up to half of the food .
i mean , there 's a lot of complex systems going on here .
we 've had to plant seeds , phosphorus , fertilizers , nutrients , water , sunlight .
so we need to design things like this far better if we 're going to start addressing serious environmental problems .
a little bit , but essentially they 're still big boxes , cold boxes that we store stuff in .
but that 's really big in the u.k .
ninety-seven percent of households in the united kingdom own an electric tea kettle .
so they 're very popular .
they seem logical , right ? yeah .
it 's with how people use the product .
the moment that very popular tv shows end .
we need to find ways of solving the problems around this , because these things are so complicated .
they have so much locked up inside them .
we want something , therefore we buy it .
some of those reforms have been good .
we know why kids do n't learn .
everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult .
i have looked at the best and i 've looked at some of the worst .
needless to say , it was .
i am powerful , and i am strong .
i deserve the education that i get here .
can we stand to have more relationships ?
never .
we 're born to make a difference .
( applause )
what are we doing ?
in theory , refugees have a right to seek asylum .
there 's restricted economic activity .
refugees in such urban areas do n't usually have the right to work .
but i think it 's a false choice .
in the new world , migration is not going to go away .
okay , it 's great to be back at ted .
( music ) ( video ) man : okay , glass , record a video .
woman : this is it . we 're on in two minutes .
man 2 : okay glass , hang out with the flying club .
man 4 : you ready ? you ready ? ( barking ) woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , take a picture .
( child shouting ) man 5 : go !
man 7 : after this bridge , first exit .
`` woman 4 : google `` '' jellyfish . '' '' ( music ) man 10 : it 's beautiful . ''
( applause ) sergey brin : oh , sorry , i just got this message from a nigerian prince .
he needs help getting 10 million dollars .
though in all seriousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that 's one of the reasons behind this project , project glass .
because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life , how you want to connect to information .
okay . and i do n't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot , but i want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it .
so when we developed glass , we thought really about , can we make something that frees your hands ?
you saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there .
they were all wearing glass , and that 's how we got that footage .
and also you want something that frees your eyes .
and ironically , if you want to hear it better , you actually just cover your ear , which is kind of surprising , but that 's how it works .
my vision when we started google 15 years ago was that eventually you would n't have to have a search query at all .
you 'd just have information come to you as you needed it .
and this is now , 15 years later , sort of the first form factor that i think can deliver that vision when you 're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth .
this project has lasted now , been just over two years .
it 's been really important to make it comfortable .
our original prototypes did n't have cameras at all , but it 's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family , my kids .
i just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment .
the cell phone is — yeah , you have to look down on it and all that , but it 's also kind of a nervous habit .
you know , i 'd be like — but in this case , you know , i whip this out and i sit there and look as if i have something very important to do or attend to .
but it really opened my eyes to how much of my life i spent just secluding away , be it email or social posts or whatnot , even though it was n't really — there 's nothing really that important or that pressing .
and with this , i know i will get certain messages if i really need them , but i do n't have to be checking them all the time .
yeah , i 've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more , doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video .
this involves blueprints , industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers .
all of this effort results in an inert object .
and that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities .
this is not sustainable .
and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another , either through the production or the absorption of energy .
and this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way .
so , i 'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture .
one of our collaborators is chemist martin hanczyc , and he 's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter .
so , martin , he works with a system called the protocell .
this little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living .
it is able to move around its environment .
it can follow chemical gradients .
here , this is a protocell , and it 's vigorously shedding this skin .
this is a violent process .
they are quite brittle . so you 've only got a part of one there .
so what we 're trying to do is , we 're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture , which contrast the current , victorian , top-down methods which impose structure upon matter .
they 've been in use , in architecture , since ancient times .
if you walk around the city of oxford , where we are today , and have a look at the brickwork , which i 've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days , you 'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone .
well , most likely it would . it might be able to grow .
it might be able to self-repair , and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment .
they think big . okay ?
so , one of these examples would of course be the historic city of venice .
so we 've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we 're working with to sustainably reclaim venice .
and architect christian kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city .
we 're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this .
now , this is the very interesting part .
what we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles .
so , you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light , toward the dark foundations .
so that these do n't just exist as one entity , we kind of chemically engineer them .
and so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically , around the foundations of venice , effectively petrifying it .
it 's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of venice .
but gradually , as the buildings are repaired , we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city .
an accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide .
also it will attract the local marine ecology , who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture .
so , this is really interesting . now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way .
but perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere .
they can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture .
and finally , an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one .
thank you .
( applause )
it 's their creation . it 's their huli creation .
but it meant the most to jeannie .
i knew they would .
if they do have , they can not retain those teachers .
this is the himalayas . up in the north , very cold .
and those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you .
and you do get to the point where there 's some wild fluctuations with bitcoin .
but what it does show is that it 's sort of gaining ground , it 's gaining respectability .
and that 's showing you that people are actually placing trust in technology , and it 's started to trump and disrupt and interrogate traditional institutions and how we think about currencies and money .
`` `` sub-prime pedaling . '' `` barclays takes you for a ride . '' ''
and this is a global survey , so these numbers are global .
so if you think we 're starting to question and disrupt and interrogate what money means , what our relationship with it is , what defines money , then the ultimate extension of that is , is there a reason for the government to be in charge of money anymore ?
so you think about loyalty .
the economist said a few years ago that there are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world than there are dollar bills in circulation .
and what i find interesting is that amazon has recently launched amazon coins .
so admittedly it 's a currency at the moment that 's purely for the kindle .
this is a fantastic article i came across in new york magazine , where it was saying that drug users across america are actually purchasing drugs with bottles of tide detergent .
so they 're going into convenience stores , stealing tide , and a $ 20 bottle of tide is equal to 10 dollars of crack cocaine or weed .
it 's infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals , so it smells very luxurious and very distinctive , and , being a procter and gamble brand , it 's been supported by a lot of mass media advertising .
so what they 're saying is that drug users are consumers too , so they have this in their neural pathways .
and what 's happening here , this is where you 've actually elected to join that nike community . you 've bought into it .
so nike is literally acting as a well-being partner , a health and fitness partner and service provider .
it seems farfetched , but when you think about it , in america in 1860 , there were 1,600 corporations issuing banknotes .
are we decoupling money from the government ?
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
but that 's looking at the speech context .
so here 's how we 're approaching this .
one 's a claim : there has been a great decline in trust , very widely believed .
the second is an aim : we should have more trust .
so what i 'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim , an aim and a task which i think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter .
i 'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others .
but , of course , i can look at the opinion polls , and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined .
the rest of us are in between , and by the way , the average person in the street is almost exactly midway .
but is that good evidence ?
what else can they record ?
`` now if somebody said to you , `` '' do you trust greengrocers ? ''
i might , after all , know that she was n't a good driver .
i might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not — but perhaps not to keep a secret .
so if we 've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated , why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly ?
secondly , what about the aim ?
it 's not what i would aim at .
i would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy .
it 's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects .
and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things .
are they competent ? are they honest ? are they reliable ?
and if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters , and reliable and honest , we 'll have a pretty good reason to trust them , because they 'll be trustworthy .
but if , on the other hand , they 're unreliable , we might not .
but that 's what we 're looking for : trustworthiness before trust .
trust is the response .
trustworthiness is what we have to judge .
`` i remember i was talking with a midwife who said , `` '' well , you see , the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby . '' '' and all over our public life , our institutional life , we find that problem , that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite . ''
you can all give your own examples there .
it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust .
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust .
you ca n't rebuild what other people give you .
you have to give them the basis for giving you their trust .
so you have to , i think , be trustworthy .
how to do it ?
let me give you a simple commercial example .
the shop where i buy my socks says i may take them back , and they do n't ask any questions .
they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color i wanted .
i think there 's a big lesson in that .
if you make yourself vulnerable to the other party , then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying .
so in the end , i think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern .
it is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy .
i 'd like to have you look at this pencil .
i can do whatever i want to my book or my car .
and they 're the masters .
we know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have , and they also resemble the kind that human beings have .
now , these included , for example , that they were conscious .
they are numerate . they understand numbers .
they can do some simple math .
so now we needed to find our chimpanzee .
tommy is a chimpanzee . you see him behind me .
we shall . we shall .
thank you .
there 's more to this painting than meets the eye .
everything in this scene , the person , the clothes , chairs , wall , gets covered in a mask of paint that mimics what 's directly below it , and in this way , i 'm able to take a three-dimensional scene and make it look like a two-dimensional painting .
but originally , this had nothing to do with either people or paint .
it was about shadows .
i came up with the idea of painting shadows .
but i did n't just want to paint the shadows .
i was n't quite sure what i was looking at .
and then when i took that moment to take a step back , magic .
i had turned my friend into a painting .
i was a little conflicted though , because i was so excited about what i 'd found , but i was just about to graduate from college with a degree in political science , and i 'd always had this dream of going to washington , d.c. , and sitting at a desk and working in government .
( laughter ) why did this have to get in the way of all that ?
it was about space and light .
it 's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg .
( laughter ) even harder was getting paint to stick to the acid in a grapefruit .
it just would erase my brush strokes like invisible ink .
it just seemed like it made more sense to practice by painting on myself .
one of my favorite models actually ended up being a retired old man who not only did n't mind sitting still and getting the paint in his ears , but he also did n't really have much embarrassment about being taken out into very public places for exhibition , like the metro .
i was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles , and i wanted to see what else i could do with it .
i came together with a collaborator , sheila vand , and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface , and that was milk .
we got a pool . we filled it with milk .
and the images were always completely unexpected in the end , because i could have a very specific image about how it would turn out , i could paint it to match that , but the moment that sheila laid back into the milk , everything would change .
and one time , she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face .
all right , well , hide your face .
but then again , i guess it 's also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar , as long as you 're willing to look beyond what 's already been brought to light , that you can see what 's below the surface , hiding in the shadows , and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye .
( applause )
and that 's architecture .
it 's expensive , it takes a long time , and it 's very complicated .
that 's how we end up with buildings like this .
this is a nice building .
this library is about how we consume media in a digital age .
but it 's the '80s , it 's cool .
the new york times called this building a miracle .
tourism in bilbao increased 2,500 percent after this building was completed .
we created an emotional reaction to these forms .
so did every mayor in the world .
that 's because there 's never been a good feedback loop in architecture .
that 's how we end up with buildings like this .
that 's ammunition .
everything is different now .
and it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around .
and finally , we 're not on opposite sides anymore .
no , well , i do n't know , it 's very familiar to me .
they 're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that 's clean , a world that is n't contaminated , a world that is n't polluted .
it 's a very wuzzy line .
they have very sophisticated cooperation .
they know mental as well as physical suffering .
and so many of these diseases , like asthma and certain kinds of cancers , are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped .
every individual has a role to play .
it 's going to depend which part , say , of america they 're in .
we want to go and work in a dog shelter .
we are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible .
so , yes , there is hope , and where is the hope ?
it 's in our hands .
but the desire element is really dialed way up .
i mean , you might just be a kid with a webcam , but if you can do something that goes viral , you get to be seen by the equivalent of sports stadiums crammed with people .
the wheel is turning .
there 's a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
now , this is big .
we may have to reinvent an ancient art form .
we have our own film school .
i bet chris has always been an inspiring guy .
hi .
so that is my claim .
we 're going to do that very soon .
mathematics enables us to do so many things .
so let 's have a look at these patterns .
he invented a language for patterns in nature .
why ?
it is actually a notation system for dancing , for tap dancing .
`` here it says the word `` '' mathematics . '' '' but actually , they 're just dots , right ? ''
ok , so let 's just do an experiment , just to play around with some straight lines .
well , no .
let 's make more lines .
so this is the stuff that we do .
and i think this is a really important thing that we do all the time .
but think about it : this is an equation .
it says that something is equal to something else , and that 's two different perspectives .
one perspective is , it 's a sum .
and i would go as far as to say that every equation is like this , every mathematical equation where you use that equality sign is actually a metaphor .
it 's an analogy between two things .
i 'm just viewing a number from another perspective .
i can even do this with rhythms , right ?
this is a square pyramid .
so this is what is called an octahedron .
i can do it even one more time .
i can take two of these and put them together like this and see what happens .
what happens ?
and if i take a bicycle pump and just pump it up , you can see that this is also a little bit like the octahedron .
let 's play around with the earth .
we can go to the beach .
we can hear the sound of the waves .
we can feel salt on our tongues .
we can do a little game .
that 's really a strange thing .
that requires imagination .
when i view the world from your perspective , i have empathy with you .
and that is how we obtain understanding .
so my conclusion is the following : understanding something really deeply has to do with the ability to change your perspective .
changing your perspective makes your mind more flexible .
it makes you open to new things , and it makes you able to understand things .
shaheen 's background i do n't even know .
we still do n't know who her parents are , who she is .
where does their journey begin ?
you have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked .
these people are deceived , forced .
that 's my biggest challenge .
they need your empathy .
can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem ?
sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
it 's never going to convince anybody to do something that they do n't want to do .
the third one is important because if we think people get used to handouts , it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets .
now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric .
and now we can see what happens .
well , if that had been the case , there would have been no industrial revolution .
and yet it does n't happen .
and it was really terrific .
so if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts , they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries .
more men who believe that the balance is best ?
`` now i have a saying that i feel very strongly about , because i am of a certain age where , when i started in my career , believe it or not , there were other women who criticized me : `` why are n't you in the carpool line ? '' ''
and so i think what needs to happen is we need to help each other .
( applause ) pm : well secretary albright , i guess you 'll be going to heaven .
thank you for joining us today .
ma : thank you all . thanks pat .
well , five years ago , i was diagnosed with parkinson 's disease .
though there 's no cure yet , advances in treatment are really impressive .
you are the new kid on the block .
nothing is automatic .
( applause ) thank you .
find what i 'm trying to tell you .
we see by reflecting .
external illumination can distort , though .
but i digress .
there will be other dawns , nights , gaudy noons .
likely , i 'll lose my way .
thank you .
before march , 2011 , i was a photographic retoucher based in new york city .
we make skinny models skinnier , perfect skin more perfect , and the impossible possible , and we get criticized in the press all the time , but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography .
soon after , an organization i volunteer with , all hands volunteers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response efforts .
we cleaned schools . we de-mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation .
they were collecting them up , and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping .
at the end of my first week there , i found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town .
this is where people were handing them in , and i was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand-cleaning them .
now , it was emotional and it was inspiring , and i 've always heard about thinking outside the box , but it was n't until i had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened .
so we started retouching photos .
once a week , we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up , where people were reclaiming their photos .
the kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn , or pieced together , picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water had n't damaged .
we could n't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned , dry and reclaimed .
we had an amazing local woman who guided us .
it 's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
when she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
her photos were found by her husband 's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood , and they 'd recognized him .
the day of the tsunami , he 'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed .
he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded .
her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
one of them got caught up in the water .
after six months in japan , 1,100 volunteers had passed through all hands , hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean over 135,000 photographs , the large majority — ( applause ) — a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
during this time , we had n't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was printer inks .
we take photos constantly .
a photo is a reminder of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
they 're our memory-keepers and our histories , the last thing we would grab and the first thing you 'd go back to look for .
the project 's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers .
for some of them , it 's given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin .
so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ?
and the same tone is going to play , and the light is going to flash again .
so you can imagine that 's a transition that has n't been entirely seamless .
it was a journey , an expedition in antarctica , the coldest , windiest , driest and highest altitude continent on earth .
in the process , we broke the record for the longest human-powered polar journey in history by more than 400 miles .
some of you may know the story .
how come this has remained the high-water mark ?
no one 's come close to that ever since .
it was as if the marathon record has remained unbroken since 1912 .
our sledges weighed 200 kilos , or 440 pounds each at the start , the same weights that the weakest of scott 's ponies pulled .
early on , we averaged 0.5 miles per hour .
certainly , if in the future we learn there is an area of the human brain that lights up when one curses oneself , i wo n't be at all surprised .
you 've heard that the average american spends 90 percent of their time indoors .
we did n't see a sunset either .
living conditions were quite spartan .
you can see on the left of this photograph , several square acres of junk waiting to be flown out from the south pole .
but then we turned around , and this is where things get interesting .
we had , before we 'd got to the pole , two weeks of almost permanent headwind , which slowed us down .
and i sound like a bit of a fraud standing here now with a sort of belly .
being that hungry has left an interesting mental scar , which is that i 've been hoovering up every hotel buffet that i can find .
i do n't regret calling for that plane for a second , because i 'm still standing here alive , with all digits intact , telling this story .
we still had 100 miles to go downhill on very slippery rock-hard blue ice .
to give you an idea of scale , this is looking down towards the mouth of the beardmore glacier .
you could fit the entirety of manhattan in the gap on the horizon .
i 've never felt as small as i did in antarctica .
there 's something in that .
a lot of people have asked me , what next ?
right now , i am very happy just recovering and in front of hotel buffets .
there we were , souls and bodies packed into a texas church on the last night of our lives .
a room like this , nonetheless .
( laughter ) this was december 31 , 1999 , the night of the second coming of christ , and the end of the world as i knew it .
all i had to do was avoid taking the mark of the beast , fight off demons , plagues and the antichrist himself .
and i thought that if i held on to her hand during this prayer , i might go right on with her .
and the prayers got louder .
and the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still .
and the organ rolled on in to add the dirge .
i looked at the clock .
it was after midnight .
now what ?
but there on that night , i did not stop believing .
i just believed a new thing : that it was possible not to believe .
we looked over all that we had made , and it was good .
all of them lived below the poverty line .
some of them came to tony 's program , called harlem grown , to get the only meal they had each day .
he told me that he would take any help that he could get .
and i was there as that help .
i felt the weight of revelation that i could sit in one room on one night , where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars , and another room , two days later , just 50 blocks up the road , where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day .
i do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today , in fact .
i have and i offer a gospel of doubt .
thomas dolby : for pure pleasure please welcome the lovely , the delectable , and the bilingual rachelle garniez .
( applause ) ( bells ) ( trumpet ) rachelle garniez : ♫ quand il me prend dans ses bras ♫ ♫ il me parle tout bas , ♫ ♫ je vois la vie en rose . ♫ ♫ il me dit des mots d'amour , ♫ ♫ des mots de tous les jours , ♫ ♫ et ca me fait quelque chose . ♫ ♫ il est entre dans mon coeur ♫ ♫ une part de bonheur ♫ ♫ dont je connais la cause . ♫ ♫ c'est lui pour moi . moi pour lui ♫ ♫ dans la vie , ♫ ♫ il me l'a dit , l'a jure [ pour ] la vie . ♫ ♫ et des que je l'apercois ♫
well , this is another trend in the field .
`` you have to make a wish to save the world . '' '' i was lost . ''
i mean , i ca n't save the world . nobody can .
the world is fucked up .
`` so i called back and i told her , `` '' look , amy , tell the ted guys i just wo n't show up . ''
`` ( laughter ) `` that 's cool . '' ''
what about art ?
could art change the world ?
i started when i was 15 years old .
and at that time , i was not thinking about changing the world .
i was doing graffiti — writing my name everywhere , using the city as a canvas .
`` it was like leaving our mark on society , to say , `` '' i was here , '' '' on the top of a building . ''
so when i found a cheap camera on the subway , i started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies — really small photos just that size .
that 's how , at 17 years old , i started pasting them .
`` and i did my first `` '' expo de rue , '' '' which means sidewalk gallery . ''
i mean , the city 's the best gallery i could imagine .
i would control it directly with the public in the streets .
that 's on the champs-elysees .
i was quite proud of that one .
because i was just 18 and i was just up there on the top of the champs-elysees .
everyone was glued to the tv , watching disturbing , frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
i mean , these kids , without control , throwing molotov cocktails , attacking the cops and the firemen , looting everything they could in the shops .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
i know those guys .
so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television .
so you can do it only with their trust .
they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .
and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name , age , even building number of these guys .
a year later , the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of paris .
and we go from thug images , who 've been stolen and distorted by the media , who 's now proudly taking over his own image .
when we got there , we just went in the street , started talking with people everywhere , and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media .
so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs — taxi-driver , lawyer , cooks .
not a smile — that really does n't tell about who you are and what you feel .
they all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever .
we called the project face 2 face .
the people will not accept .
`` the army will shoot you , and hamas will kidnap you . '' '' we said , `` '' okay , let 's try and push as far as we can . '' '' i love the way that people will ask me , `` how big will my photo be ? '' ''
`` `` it will be as big as your house . '' ''
`` and so palestinians guys say , `` calm down . no wait . i 'm going to find you a solution . '' ''
so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born .
we had all sorts of help from all walks of life .
okay , for example , that 's palestine .
`` people come around us and start asking , `` what are you doing here ? '' ''
`` `` '' oh , we 're actually doing an art project and we are pasting an israeli and a palestinian doing the same job . ''
`` and those ones are actually two taxi-drivers . '' '' and then there was always a silence . ''
`` `` '' you mean you 're pasting an israeli face — doing a face — right here ? '' '' `` well , yeah , yeah , that 's part of the project . '' ''
( applause ) we even pasted on israeli military towers , and nothing happened .
when you paste an image , it 's just paper and glue .
people can tear it , tag on it , or even pee on it — some are a bit high for that , i agree — but the people in the street , they are the curator .
the rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
but exactly four years after , the photos , most of them are still there .
we did n't push the limit ; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought .
in the middle east , i experienced my work in places without [ many ] museums .
so i decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums .
so for example , in june 2008 , i was watching tv in paris , and then i heard about this terrible thing that happened in rio de janeiro — the first favela of brazil named providencia .
three kids — that was three students — were [ detained ] by the army because they were not carrying their papers .
all brazil was shocked .
i heard it was one of the most violent favelas , because the largest drug cartel controls it .
when i arrived — i mean , i did n't have any contact with any ngo .
there was none in place — no association , no ngos , nothing — no eyewitnesses .
we 're hungry for culture .
then the next day , i held a meeting on the main square and some women came .
after that day , everyone in the favela gave me the green light .
`` the drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place , so i told them , `` '' you know what ? ''
and on that stairs , that 's where the traffickers always stand and there 's a lot of exchange of fire .
and then we pasted everywhere — the whole hill .
( applause ) what was interesting is that the media could n't get in .
i mean , you should see that .
they would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens , and we would see ourselves , on tv , pasting .
`` and they would put a number : `` '' please call this number if you know what 's going on in providencia . '' '' we just did a project and then left so the media would n't know . ''
we went to africa , sudan , sierra leone , liberia , kenya .
i mean , they want to know what you 're up to .
`` they kept asking me , `` '' what is the purpose of your project ? ''
`` are you an ngo ? are you the media ? '' '' art . just doing art . ''
`` do n't you have color in france ? '' '' ( laughter ) or they tell you , `` '' are these people all dead ? '' '' some who understood the project would explain it to others . ''
`` and to a man who did not understand , i heard someone say , `` '' you know , you 've been here for a few hours trying to understand , discussing with your fellows . ''
it becomes a desire , a need , an armor .
women are always the first ones targeted during conflict .
this time we covered the roofs of the houses , but we did n't use paper , because paper does n't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house — vinyl does .
so the people kept it .
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so [ many ] houses inside .
`` ( laughter ) when the roofs were covered , a woman said as a joke , `` now god can see me . '' ''
when you look at kibera now , they look back .
in india it was just impossible to paste .
so we decided to paste white , white on the walls .
`` so people would come to us and ask us , `` hey , what are you up to ? '' ''
`` `` oh , you know , we 're just doing art . '' `` art ? '' ''
of course , they were confused .
so the more dust you have , the more it will reveal the photo .
so we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves .
so we did n't get caught this time .
each project — that 's a film from women are heroes .
for each project we do a film .
and the photos kept traveling even without us .
because that 's a big part of it . there 's layers behind each photo .
behind each image is a story .
but to get it , they would have to [ get ] it signed by one of the women .
we did that in most of the places .
and so in providencia , for example , in the favela , we have a cultural center running there .
in kibera , each year we cover more roofs .
`` because of course , when we left , the people who were just at the edge of the project said , `` '' hey , what about my roof ? '' '' so we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project . ''
a really important point for me is that i do n't use any brand or corporate sponsors .
i think , today , as important as the result is the way you do things .
we just did some pasting in los angeles on another project in the last weeks .
`` because this can be taken for advertising , and because of the law , it has to be taken down . '' '' but tell me , advertising for what ? ''
but they asked me for a promise basically .
`` they asked me , `` '' please , make our story travel with you . '' '' so i did . that 's paris . ''
that 's rio .
you understand the full scope of the project .
new york .
it does n't matter today if it 's your photo or not .
so for example , i pasted the photo of the minaret in switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country .
( applause ) this image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in chernobyl originally , and i pasted it in southern italy , where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .
art is not supposed to change the world , to change practical things , but to change perceptions .
art can change the way we see the world .
actually the fact that art can not change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions , and then enables you to change the world .
`` people say , `` '' oh , why do n't you go in iraq or afghanistan . ''
so now my wish is : ( mock drum roll ) ( laughter ) i wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project , and together we 'll turn the world inside out .
and this starts right now .
yes , everyone in the room .
everyone watching .
the full data is on the website — insideoutproject.net — that is launching today .
what we see changes who we are .
so i hope that , together , we 'll create something that the world will remember .
and this starts right now and depends on you .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
we 'd certainly done stupider things .
would you believe that watch still works ?
that night began my formal relationship with death — my death — and it also began my long run as a patient .
it 's a good word .
so i guess we 're all patients .
why ?
which is to say , of course , it was badly designed .
so let 's begin at the end .
was this a good idea ?
so much of what we 're talking about today is a shift in perspective .
perspective , that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with , turning anguish into a flower .
it takes a few minutes ; it 's a sweet , simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth , rather than repugnance .
beauty can be found anywhere .
and one night , it began to snow outside .
i remember my nurses complaining about driving through it .
in a hospital , that 's a stolen moment .
not because they had found some final peace or transcendence , but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become — in a word , cut off , or ugly .
little things are n't so little .
beneficence .
`` `` '' play '' '' may sound like a funny word here . ''
but it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation .
thank you .
i wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level .
this was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science .
let 's see if they congregate around certain ideas .
used to be , there were two mustards : french 's and gulden 's .
and the example he used was coffee .
and yet , i 've taken that idea and made it my own .
most of you see a barbershop , but i see an opportunity : an opportunity for health , an opportunity for health equity .
historically , the barbershop has been a safe haven for black men .
it 's a place where we do n't feel threatened , or threatening .
it 's a place of loyalty and trust .
the talk , the shop talk , the conversation , that is the essence of the black barbershop .
i can remember going to the barbershop with my dad as a kid .
`` `` '' hey rev , '' '' they would say to my dad . ''
the men would talk about politics and sports and music and world news , national news , neighborhood news .
but many times they also talked about health .
there 's a lot of talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop .
that 's because almost 40 percent of black men have it .
`` `` say , did you hear about jimmy ? he had a stroke . '' ''
the doctor 's office is only a place that you go when you do n't feel well .
so it 's no wonder that some men do n't want to be bothered and skip going to the doctor altogether , especially if they feel fine .
but herein lies the problem .
i 've been lucky enough to have denny as my barber for the last eight years .
he 's a leader and a passionate advocate for the well-being of his community .
with this kind of activism , and community investment that typifies the black barbershop , of course the barbershop is a perfect place to talk about high blood pressure and other health concerns in the community .
second , because the barbershop is a place of connection , loyalty and trust , it 's a place where you 're more open to have a conversation about health and especially about high blood pressure .
thank you .
for the last 10 years , i 've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks .
and the kind of social network i 'm talking about is not the recent online variety , but rather , the kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years , ever since we emerged from the african savannah .
so , i form friendships and co-worker and sibling and relative relationships with other people who in turn have similar relationships with other people .
and this spreads on out endlessly into a distance .
every dot is a person .
and you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity , in which we 're all embedded .
and my colleague , james fowler and i have been studying for quite sometime what are the mathematical , social , biological and psychological rules that govern how these networks are assembled and what are the similar rules that govern how they operate , how they affect our lives .
and actually , about a year or so ago , there was this promulgation of the idea of google flu trends , with respect to the flu , where by looking at people 's searching behavior today , we could know where the flu — what the status of the epidemic was today , what 's the prevalence of the epidemic today .
for example , anything that spreads by a form of social contagion could be understood in this way , from abstract ideas on the left like patriotism , or altruism , or religion to practices like dieting behavior , or book purchasing , or drinking , or bicycle-helmet [ and ] other safety practices , or products that people might buy , purchases of electronic goods , anything in which there 's kind of an interpersonal spread .
a kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism i 'm going to show you now .
so here on the y-axis , we have the percent of the people affected , and on the x-axis , we have time .
and the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning , let 's say one or two people are infected , or affected by the thing and then they affect , or infect , two people , who in turn affect four , eight , 16 and so forth , and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve .
and eventually , you saturate the population .
and this holds for germs , ideas , product adoption , behaviors , and the like .
now if you look at a network like this — this is 105 people .
you could have friendship relationships , sibling relationships , spousal relationships , co-worker relationships , neighbor relationships and the like .
and different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties .
or , for instance , people 's smoking behavior might be influenced by their friends .
or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior might be influenced by their coworkers , or by their neighbors .
but not all positions in the network are the same .
so if you look at this , you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections .
so , if you look at nodes a and b , they both have six connections .
but if you can see this image [ of the network ] from a bird 's eye view , you can appreciate that there 's something very different about nodes a and b .
so , let me ask you this — i can cultivate this intuition by asking a question — who would you rather be if a deadly germ was spreading through the network , a or b ?
now , who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network ?
so , if we want to track something that was spreading through a network , what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network , including node a , monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network , and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network .
in the dotted red line , we show what the adoption would be in the random people , and in the left-hand line , shifted to the left , we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network .
on the y-axis is the cumulative instances of contagion , and on the x-axis is the time .
and what we show here is — like , here — very few people are affected , more and more and more and up to here , and here 's the peak of the epidemic .
but shifted to the left is what 's occurring in the central individuals .
and this difference in time between the two is the early detection , the early warning we can get , about an impending epidemic in the human population .
the problem , however , is that mapping human social networks is not always possible .
it can be expensive , not feasible , unethical , or , frankly , just not possible to do such a thing .
so , how can we figure out who the central people are in a network without actually mapping the network ?
your friends have more friends than you do , and this is known as the friendship paradox .
the friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree , and are more central than the random people themselves .
so , we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks .
and we did this passively by looking at whether or not they 'd gone to university health services .
and also , we had them [ actively ] email us a couple of times a week .
exactly what we predicted happened .
and the difference in the two is 16 days .
by monitoring the friends group , we could get 16 days advance warning of an impending epidemic in this human population .
among the friends , the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero in adoption of the innovation , for example , would be evidence of an impending epidemic .
or you could see the first time the two curves diverged , as shown on the left .
and that , as indicated by the white line , occurred 46 days before the peak of the epidemic .
it could depend on the nature of the pathogen — different pathogens , using this technique , you 'd get different warning — or other phenomena that are spreading , or frankly , on the structure of the human network .
now in our case , although it was n't necessary , we could also actually map the network of the students .
we 're going to take daily cuts through the network for 120 days .
the red dots are going to be cases of the flu , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu .
and the size of the dots is going to be proportional to how many of their friends have the flu .
so bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu .
and if you look at this image — here we are now in september the 13th — you 're going to see a few cases light up .
here we are on october the 19th .
the key thing is that for it to work , there has to be interpersonal influence .
it can not be because of some broadcast mechanism affecting everyone uniformly .
now the same insights can also be exploited — with respect to networks — can also be exploited in other ways , for example , in the use of targeting specific people for interventions .
so , for example , most of you are probably familiar with the notion of herd immunity .
so , if we have a population of a thousand people , and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen , we do n't have to immunize every single person .
they are surrounded by immunized people .
well , some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample of these 1000 people , 300 people and immunized them .
and the answer is no .
and similar ideas can be used , for instance , to target distribution of things like bed nets in the developing world .
or , frankly , for advertising with all kinds of products .
this is a map of eight million phone users in a european country .
every dot is a person , and every line represents a volume of calls between the people .
and we can use such data , that 's being passively obtained , to map these whole countries and understand who is located where within the network .
without actually having to query them at all , we can get this kind of a structural insight .
and other sources of information , as you 're no doubt aware are available about such features , from email interactions , online interactions , online social networks and so forth .
`` and in fact , we are in the era of what i would call `` '' massive-passive '' '' data collection efforts . ''
because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom , but where everyone is , and what they 're thinking based on what they 're uploading on the internet , and what they 're buying based on their purchases .
and all this administrative data can be pulled together and processed to understand human behavior in a way we never could before .
so , for example , we could use truckers ' purchases of fuel .
and we see a blip up in the truckers ' purchases of fuel , and we know that a recession is about to end .
or we can monitor the velocity with which people are moving with their phones on a highway , and the phone company can see , as the velocity is slowing down , that there 's a traffic jam .
and they can feed that information back to their subscribers , but only to their subscribers on the same highway located behind the traffic jam !
or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors , passively , and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within [ networks of ] doctors .
or again , we can monitor purchasing behavior in people and watch how these types of phenomena can diffuse within human populations .
and be able , on a large scale , to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people .
`` in fact , the availability of these data , i think , heralds a kind of new era of what i and others would like to call `` computational social science . '' ''
but now we have access to these kinds of data that allow us to understand social processes and social phenomena in an entirely new way that was never before possible .
we have the right to move through the world as we choose , free from harassment or violence .
we have the right to respect .
we are not just women .
we are people with different bodies , gender expressions , faiths , sexualities , class backgrounds , abilities , and so much more .
i have another confession .
if a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children , i embrace that choice , too .
we expect them to pose perfectly .
why must it be so catchy ?
we can all make better choices .
there was an incident .
in one hand , i hold the power to accomplish anything .
i hope that we can all do the same .
and he 's not the only one in the world .
it works just purely on its form .
it looks like a cup that could be used by you , me , any clumsy person , and that makes it much more comforting for them to use , to blend in .
so , well , one problem solved , many more to go .
and a lot of ideas were tested and tried on him , but the one that finally worked was this one . let 's take a look .
what we need are human-centered solutions .
what i wish to do is make every parkinson 's patient feel like my uncle felt that day .
all we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity , to go out there , observe .
but let 's not stop at that .
let 's find these complex problems . do n't be scared of them .
test these solutions , fail if needed , but with newer insights to make it better .
what would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions ?
( applause )
if you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth .
and we just keep telling ourselves , and we do it all the time .
( applause ) henry evans : hello .
my dad was a lawyer .
my mom was a homemaker .
my six siblings and i were good kids , but caused our fair share of trouble .
we were looking forward to rebuilding it , but eight months after we moved in , i suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect .
overnight , i became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40 .
i became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled .
head tracking devices sold commercially by the company madentec convert my tiny head movements into cursor movements , and enable my use of a regular computer .
i can surf the web , exchange email with people , and routinely destroy my friend steve cousins in online word games .
for about two years , robots for humanity developed ways for me to use the pr2 as my body surrogate .
i began doing tasks around the house .
i saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute , both for myself and others in my circumstance .
all of us have disabilities in one form or another .
chad showed me how easy it is to purchase and fly aerial drones .
using a mouse cursor i control with my head , these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser .
i could look around our garden and see the grapes we are growing .
with chad 's group at brown , i regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week , from my home 3,000 miles away .
( laughter ) are you excited to be at tedxmidatlantic ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) can you show us how excited you are ? ( laughter )
can you show us how good of a pilot you are ?
what makes henry 's story amazing is it 's about understanding henry 's needs , understanding what people in henry 's situation need from technology , and then also understanding what advanced technology can provide , and then bringing those two things together for use in a wise and responsible way .
and our hope is that , by providing these tools , that you 'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled , to provide care for our aging population , to help better educate our children , to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future , to both monitor and protect our environment , and to explore the universe .
back to you , henry .
with this drone setup , we show the potential for bedridden people to once again be able to explore the outside world , and robotics will eventually provide a level playing field where one is only limited by their mental acuity and imagination , where the disabled are able to perform the same activities as everyone else , and perhaps better , and technology will even allow us to provide an outlet for many people who are presently considered vegetables .
i would have died .
our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone 's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe .
it 's a part of the spiritual world .
that 's the tradition of god , the soul and immortality .
but we know that that 's purely syntactical . that 's symbolic .
we know that actual human consciousness has something more than that .
it 's got a semantics .
or is it observer-relative ?
we believe that reason is the highest of the faculties .
( applause )
and other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces .
you may recognize these two guys .
`` this is max mathews and john kelly from bell labs in the '60s , where they created the song `` '' daisy bell , '' '' which was the world 's first singing computer . ''
`` you may recognize it from `` '' 2001 : a space odyssey . '' '' when hal 's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song , as a reference to when computers became human . ''
this is what that sounded like .
you type in your code , but you first test your mic .
( honk ) and then you 'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice .
after previewing it and confirming it 's what you submitted , you could submit it into the mechanical turk with no other context .
recording : ♫ daisy , daisy ♫ ♫ give me your answer do ♫ ♫ i 'm half crazy ♫ ♫ all for the love of you ♫ ♫ it ca n't be a stylish marriage ♫ ♫ i ca n't afford a carriage ♫ ♫ but you 'll look sweet upon the seat ♫ ♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ ak : so james surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds , that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual .
we wanted to see how this applies to collaborative , distributed music making , where nobody has any idea what it is they 're working on .
so if you go to the bicyclebuiltfortwothousand.com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together .
( noise ) chorus : ♫ daisy , daisy ♫ ♫ give me your answer do ♫ ♫ i 'm half crazy ♫ ♫ all for the love of you ♫ ♫ it ca n't be a stylish marriage ♫ ♫ i ca n't afford a carriage ♫ ♫ but you 'd look sweet upon the seat ♫ ♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ ak : so stepping back for a quick second , when i was at ucla going to grad school , i was also working at a place called the center for embedded network sensing .
`` and this was seen by a director in l.a. named james frost who said , `` '' wait a minute . ''
`` you mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video ? '' '' so we did exactly that . ''
we made a music video for one of my favorite bands , radiohead .
more recently , somebody even 3d-printed thom yorke 's head , which is a little creepy , but pretty cool .
but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of rally behind and build something for .
so we put the idea on the back burner for a few months .
so i teamed up with my good friend ricardo cabello , also known as mr. doob , who 's a much better programmer than i am , and he made this amazing flash drawing tool .
as you know , an animation is a series of images .
one is the beginning of the music video .
and that 's going to be followed by a short clip of people who have already contributed to the project talking about it briefly .
( music ) ( video ) johnny cash : ♫ there ai n't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body down ♫ ♫ there ai n't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold body down ♫ ♫ when i hear the trumpet sound ♫ ♫ i 'm going to ride right out of the ground ♫ ♫ ai n't no grave ♫ ♫ can hold my body ... ♫ ( applause ) ak : what better way to pay tribute to the man than to make something for one of his songs .
and i just thought it 'd be wonderful , it 'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory .
collaborator four : i 've seen everybody from japan , venezuela , to the states , to knoxville , tennessee .
collaborator five : as much as is different from frame to frame , it really is personal .
collaborator six : watching the video in my room , i could see me not understanding at the beginning of it .
it 's the sum total of his life , all the things that had happened — the bad things , the good things .
you 're hearing a person 's life .
and below it are all the individual frames that people have been submitting to the project .
if you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails , you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located .
in addition to that , it 's listed , the artist 's name , the location , how long they spent drawing it .
and you can sort the video a number of different ways .
`` you can say , `` '' i want to see the pointillist version or the sketchy version or the realistic version . ''
so the last project i want to talk to you about is another collaboration with chris milk .
but most importantly , i think , we really wanted to make an experience that was unlike the johnny cash project , where you had a small group of people spending a lot of time to contribute something for everyone .
what if we had a very low commitment , but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed ?
so the project starts off by asking you to enter the address of the home where you grew up .
so this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address , but i 'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect .
( video ) win butler : ♫ now our lives are changing fast ♫ ♫ now our lives are changing fast ♫ ♫ hope that something pure can last ♫ ♫ hope that something pure can last ♫ ♫ ooh we used to wait ♫ ♫ ooh we used to wait ♫ ♫ ooh we used to wait ♫ ♫ sometimes it never came ♫ ♫ sometimes it never came ♫ ♫ still moving through the pain ♫ ♫ we used to wait for it ♫ ♫ we used to wait for it ♫ ♫ we used to wait for it ♫ ak : so i think , if there 's one thing to take away from my talk today ,
thanks a lot .
( applause )
but thinking about where it all goes is the first step in activating what are actually superpowers in our poop and pee .
( laughter ) yeah .
this landscape was watered with treated sewage water .
i imagine it might .
and that 's ok .
how we feel about this is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be .
`` i mean , i can use profane words like `` '' shit '' '' and `` '' piss , '' '' and then my grandma wo n't watch the video . ''
`` or i can use scientific words like `` '' excrement '' '' and `` '' feces . '' '' humph . ''
i 'll use a mix .
it looks more like a park than a treatment plant .
this approach is called integrated water management , or holistic or closed-loop .
but in this approach , we 're doing one step better .
we 're designing for reuse from the very beginning , because everything does get reused , only now we 're planning for it .
and often , that makes for really beautiful spaces .
do you want this in your yard ?
why not ?
i got really curious about this question .
why is n't that kind of thing the new normal ?
but innovation is n't always incremental .
it turns out , how we feel about any particular new technique gets into everything we do : how we talk about it , how we encourage people to study , our jokes , our codes ...
and it ultimately determines how innovative we can be .
but not so .
here in the us we still get sick from drinking shit in our sewage water .
so we 're not solving it .
too much rain overflows into the river .
and portland is not alone here .
think of your poo and pee as a health smoothie for a tree .
the other half goes right out the other side .
but this is n't just some problem that we need to contain .
if we flip this around , we can create a resource that can solve so many of our other problems .
`` and i want to get you comfortable with this idea , so imagine the things i 'm going to show you , these technologies , and this attitude that says , `` '' we 're going to reuse this . ''
that dark brown poo in the toilet is dark brown because of what ?
voilà ! healthier people .
imagine how much energy we could save .
now , some of us are concerned about industrial pollutants contaminating this reuse cycle .
that can be addressed .
but we need to separate our discomfort about talking about poo and pee so we can calmly talk about how we want to reuse it and what things we do n't want to reuse .
and get this : if we change our approach to sanitation , we can start to slow down climate change .
remember that carbon in the poop ?
and that could help slow down global warming .
but more importantly , they felt comfortable seeing what was going down the toilet as a resource .
here 's an average house in portland , oregon .
but it was allowed in five other states nearby .
that was recode 's — my organization 's — first code-change campaign .
here 's a great example where the integrated water management approach was the cheapest .
how ?
this was the first permit of its kind in oregon .
`` brave and open-minded people sat down and felt comfortable saying , `` yeah , that shit makes sense . '' ''
now it 's more a part of our web of power than ever before .
and it 's creating resiliency .
we now have sources of power like the sun that do n't vary with our earthly dramas .
it 's us .
we 're talking about energy .
it 's cool to talk about energy .
if we can get over this discomfort with this entire topic , we could create something that creates our future goldmine .
`` will they be gainfully employed ? '' '' ( laughter ) `` or are they going to be wreaking havoc in some waterway ? '' ''
if you do n't know , find out .
and if you do n't like the answer , figure out how you can communicate to those who can drive this change that you have advanced potty training , that you are ready for reuse .
how all of you feel is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be .
we can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us .
i am both black and a woman .
i have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist since i was 12 years old .
i began my college experience just after my family had fallen apart .
thus , i was one of roughly 60 percent of women of color who find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals .
after graduation , and despite knowing that i wanted a phd in astrophysics , i fell through the cracks .
after receiving my master 's at fisk , i went on to yale to complete my phd .
beyond that , though , it underscores that the women of color in stem do not experience the same set of barriers that just women or just people of color face .
stem is utterly incomplete without each individual piece .
my personal hope is that you 'll become an astrophysicist , but beyond that , anything you want .
women of color in stem occupy some of the toughest and most exciting sociotechnological issues of our time .
simply put , we can not be the most excellent expression of our collective genius without the full measure of humanity brought to bear .
and it still is .
this is our last project in chile .
twenty-five fishermen work for me .
and you come here to tell me that i can not keep on living here ?
you ! you are imposing this on me !
so a while ago , i tried an experiment .
did i want to speak in public ?
almost . i 'm not perfect at it , but i try hard to practice it .
see , i have what most people would call a dream job .
i 'm a writer . i imagine . i make stuff up for a living .
i make television , a great deal of television .
it 's all job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat , no tears .
i work a lot , very hard , and i love it .
it is hitting every high note . it is running a marathon .
that feeling , you ca n't help but strive for greatness at any cost .
or , maybe it 's called being a workaholic .
maybe it 's just fear of failure .
i do n't know .
i like that hum . i love that hum .
am i nothing but that hum ?
and then the hum stopped .
the hum of the engine died .
inside me was silence .
i was the hum , and the hum was me .
and then my southern waitress toddler asks me a question .
when did that happen ?
`` and so she says , `` '' momma , wan na play ? '' '' and i say , `` '' yes . '' '' there 's nothing special about it . ''
the air is so rare in this place for me that i can barely breathe .
something in me loosens .
and it 's not instantaneous , but it happens , it does happen .
well , let 's not get carried away .
the hum is joy-specific .
the real hum is love-specific .
the hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life .
any time my child asks me to play , i will say yes .
i do n't like it .
well , me .
i mean , let 's be honest , i call myself a titan .
we have 30-second dance parties .
i blow bubbles and they pop them .
i itch for my cell phone always .
but it is ok .
my tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up .
you can do it too , say yes every time your child asks you to play .
you know why ? because you 're not rihanna and you 're not a muppet .
it 's an amazing 15 minutes , but it 's 15 minutes .
if i 'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy , i 'm invisible after 15 minutes .
15 minutes is all you need .
uninterrupted is the key .
no cell phone , no laundry , no anything .
work does n't work without play .
but now , i like that hum , but i do n't love that hum .
i am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends .
my brain is still global . my campfires still burn .
the more i play , the freer my mind becomes .
the more i feel that hum , the more i know who i am .
that 's the dream of the job .
i said yes to less work and more play .
thank you .
fast-forward a couple of decades , and i hope i did n't do too badly in making my father proud of his would-be son .
my mother 's generation was n't into professional leadership .
there were some encouraging men along the way , but none knew the demands and pressures i was facing , pressures that got particularly acute when i had my own two beautiful children .
so arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models .
as i proceeded with my presentation , i could see john in the corner of my eye .
`` `` '' what you did up there was unacceptable ! ''
i presented a couple of gender parity indices , and some conclusions about the arab world .
`` it 's just never going to happen . '' '' it took me a couple of days to fully absorb this incident and its implications , but once i did , i reached three conclusions . ''
one , that these were his issues , his complexes .
( laughter ) i got one , by the way , and boy , was he great .
and three , that i would get to show john what women with children can do .
i would lie if i said these words did n't hurt .
but just like i did with john , i quickly reminded myself that these were their issues , their complexes .
[ be happy , it drives people crazy . ] ( applause ) you see , as a young woman in these situations , you have two options .
you can either decide to internalize these negative messages that are being thrown at you , to let them make you feel like a failure , like success is way too hard to ever achieve , or you can choose to see that others ' negativity is their own issue , and instead transform it into your own personal fuel .
i have learned to always go for option two , and i have found that it has taken me from strength to strength .
things are changing , but it will take time .
to achieve this , i have found the hard way that you need to apply your hard-earned professional skills to your personal life .
one thing to know about the middle east is that nearly every family has access to affordable domestic help .
the challenge therefore becomes how to recruit effectively .
just like i would in my business life , i have based the selection of who would support me with my children while i 'm at work on a strong referral .
this lesson applies whatever your childcare situation , whether an au pair , nursery , part-time nanny that you share with someone else .
but this is not just about surviving in your dual role as a career woman and mother .
when i am with my children , i try to leave work out of our lives .
this explains , i think , to some extent , why you find so few women in politics in the arab world .
the majority of those are also women .
if there 's only room for one woman at the top , then you ca n't make room for others , much less lift them up .
the arab world , too , is making progress , despite many recent setbacks .
just this year , the uae appointed five new female ministers to its cabinet , for a total of eight female ministers .
that 's nearly 28 percent of the cabinet , and more than many developed countries can claim .
thank you .
( applause )
two hundred years of modern science .
two hundred years is not a lot of time , while nature had three billion years to perfect some of the most amazing materials , that we wish we had in our possession .
remember , these materials carry a quality assurance of three billion years .
well , not exactly as we drink in our tea .
yet it 's made of sugar .
but here 's the problem : say you want to buy a half a ton of nanocellulose to build a boat or an airplane .
you wo n't find it .
and we produce this mountain every year .
we can do a lot of things with the material .
but this is not the only thing .
it turns out , they make this wonderful material , which is called resilin .
it brings back all the energy .
so that 's exactly what we did .
they decided to combine the strongest material produced by the plant kingdom with the most elastic material produced by the insect kingdom — nanocellulose with resilin .
and the result is amazing .
but in fact , the reason is much more fundamental .
the reason is that in nature , there is no one there that actually takes my head and screws it onto my neck , or takes my skin and glues it onto my body .
in nature , everything is self-assembled .
other times , they are enzymes that make other materials , like polysaccharides , fatty acids .
and the common feature about all these materials is that they need no one .
they recognize each other and self-assemble into structures — scaffolds on which cells are proliferating to give tissues .
so safety is a big issue .
now here , i have a personal interest .
this is my father , zvi , in our winery in israel .
a heart valve , very similar to the one that i showed you before , seven years ago , was implanted in his body .
yeah , of course , i can take those bricks and build a new wall .
but it 's not going to be the same .
so that 's exactly what we did .
actually , it 's happening now .
and more recently , even , we 've been able to launch into the market here in europe a flowable gel that is used for diabetic foot ulcers , that is now approved for use in the clinic .
this is happening now .
by doing that , we 've been able to make a superfiber which is about 380 percent tougher , and 300 percent more elastic .
it will be better .
it actually will perform better and will last longer .
my friend zion suliman once told me a smart sentence .
and the text is the dna of life .
and it starts with three people .
and then you notice that those seeds become farms across the bronx that look like this .
and i do n't like weeding , and i do n't like back-breaking labor .
i expect them to be engaged , and man , are they !
we take orders now . i 'm booking for the spring .
thank you .
( applause )
he 's even here today .
masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers , camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed but need hugs .
this is a training ground .
my high school is chicago , diverse and segregated on purpose .
social lines are barbed wire .
trained at a young age to capitalize , letters taught now that capitalism raises you but you have to step on someone else to get there .
this is a training ground where one group is taught to lead and the other is made to follow .
the need for degrees has left so many people frozen .
taking tests is stressful , but bubbling in a scantron does not stop bullets from bursting .
( applause )
you may never have heard of kenema , sierra leone or arua , nigeria .
they show their spirit .
and it was frightening , frightening for us all .
from that specimen that we take from a patient 's blood to detect ebola , we can discard it , obviously .
everybody wants to play a part .
and the data has still not come .
and we have to do that .
the majority of the sales are apple .
( applause )
ag : thank you . mk : thank you .
tr : thank you so much .
very big ears , strange nose leaves , but teeny-tiny eyes .
who — put up your hands — who says two years ?
carlos , the vietnam vet marine who volunteered for three tours and got shot up in every one .
but things have changed .
now , making war — this is something that we are good at .
why is that ?
`` `` '' mindfuck '' '' is the most common term . ''
the first of these treatments is cognitive therapy , and this is a kind of mental recalibration .
so we never advise veterans to turn off caution completely .
if you find yourself in a bad neighborhood , you turn it up .
the next of these treatments is exposure therapy , and this is a kind of field training , and the fastest of the proven effective treatments out there .
and , critically — staying in these environments .
now , at first he was very anxious .
he processed his memories so much that his brain no longer needed to return to those experiences in his sleep .
but it 's often difficult .
and there are trust issues .
i see people 's lives transform .
now , the best way of ending human suffering caused by war is to never go to war .
but we are just not there yet as a species .
the magazine would n't pay for me to go there .
so , i 'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these .
so we do not expect at all to find a cave there .
the cave is huge .
what you can find there is really evidence of a lost world .
you know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods .
but the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people .
now we are not there yet , but it is happening .
here is just some data . this is china .
now think what this means .
that is something that we should embrace — a wealthy china , a wealthy india , a wealthy africa .
1900s : maybe one percent .
so the question is , how can we use this ?
or you can play games and have actual buttons .
but we 've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change .
so , where does this point ?
this is south central : liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
so the city planners , they get together and they figure they 're going to change the name south central to make it represent something else , so they change it to south los angeles , like this is going to fix what 's really going wrong in the city .
this is south los angeles . ( laughter ) liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
just like 26.5 million other americans , i live in a food desert , south central los angeles , home of the drive-thru and the drive-by .
funny thing is , the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys .
people are dying from curable diseases in south central los angeles .
for instance , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , beverly hills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
i got tired of seeing this happening .
and i was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
i see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
and i figured , this has to stop .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
it 's 150 feet by 10 feet .
and the garden , it was beautiful .
and then somebody complained .
the city came down on me , and basically gave me a citation saying that i had to remove my garden , which this citation was turning into a warrant .
`` a warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? '' '' ( laughter ) and i was like , `` '' cool . bring it . '' '' because this time it was n't coming up . ''
we had a victory on our hands .
i mean , come on , why would n't they ?
l.a. leads the united states in vacant lots that the city actually owns .
they own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
that 's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants .
growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
it 's my gospel , when i 'm telling people , grow your own food .
( applause ) see , i have a legacy in south central .
and i refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people , and i 'm manufacturing my own reality .
i use the garden , the soil , like it 's a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that 's my embellishment for that cloth .
you 'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
you 'd be surprised how kids are affected by this .
gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do , especially in the inner city .
plus you get strawberries .
( laughter ) i remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10:30 at night , and they were in my yard , and i came out and they looked so ashamed .
`` it made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only reinforced why i do this , and people asked me , `` '' fin , are n't you afraid people are going to steal your food ? '' '' and i 'm like , `` '' hell no , i ai n't afraid they 're gon na steal it . ''
( laughter ) if they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes . ( applause ) but when none of this is presented to them , if they 're not shown how food affects the mind and the body , they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them .
i see young people and they want to work , but they 're in this thing where they 're caught up — i see kids of color and they 're just on this track that 's designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
so with gardening , i see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
and when we do this , who knows ?
but if we do n't change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
now this is one of my plans . this is what i want to do .
i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
now do n't get me wrong .
i 'm not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
( laughter ) ( applause ) what i 'm talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and letting them know the joy , the pride and the honor in growing your own food , opening farmer 's markets .
we got ta flip the script on what a gangsta is .
if you ai n't a gardener , you ai n't gangsta .
get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
and let that be your weapon of choice .
if you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit .
peace . thank you .
this technology made a very important impact on us .
it changed the way our history developed .
but it 's a technology so pervasive , so invisible , that we , for a long time , forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution .
but we see the results of this technology , still .
so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please .
turn and face your neighbors .
please , also on the balcony .
smile . smile . open the mouths .
smile , friendly .
( laughter ) do you — do you see any canine teeth ? ( laughter )
of course not .
so i would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves .
so cooking is a very important technology .
i do n't know how you feel , but i like to cook for entertainment .
those have to pay tuition fees know .
you now , our brain is two to three percent of the body mass , but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use .
where does the energy come from . of course , from food .
invisible — everyone of us does it every day , so to speak .
so if we think about this unleashing human potential , which was possible by cooking and food , why do we talk so badly about food ?
now , cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species .
we walked out of africa two times .
we populated all the ecologies .
if you can cook , nothing can happen to you , because whatever you find , you will try to transform it .
it keeps also your brain working .
the brain could grow , but the gut actually shrunk .
okay , it 's not obvious to be honest .
so because of having cooked food , it 's easier to digest .
you can influence your own technologies you have invented .
you can continue to innovate and invent .
now the big brain did this also with cooking .
but how did it actually run this show ?
and this is actually taste reward and energy .
you know we have up to five tastes , three of them sustain us .
salty , because you need salt , otherwise your electric body will not work .
and two tastes which protect you — bitter and sour , which are against poisonous and rotten material .
but of course , they are hard-wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way .
think about bittersweet chocolate ; or think about the acidity of yogurt — wonderful — mixed with strawberry fruits .
reward : this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements — the external states , our internal states , how do we feel , and so on are put together .
and as i say , energy was necessary .
and the gut is a silent voice — it 's going more for feelings .
i use the euphemism digestive comfort — actually — it 's a digestive discomfort , which the gut is concerned with .
`` all the managers in the room say , `` '' you do n't tell me something new , because we know , gut feeling . ''
`` this is what we are using . '' '' ( laughter ) and actually you use it and it 's actually useful . ''
because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system , they do speak with each other and make decisions .
now if there 's a gut brain , we should also learn to talk with this brain .
i took the three elements — stomach , small intestine and colon .
and between this muscle , they found nervous tissues , a lot of nervous tissues , which penetrate actually the muscle — penetrate the submucosa , where you have all the elements for the immune system .
the gut is actually the largest immune system , defending your body .
now if you think about the gut , the gut is — if you could stretch it — 40 meters long , the length of a tennis court .
if we could unroll it , get out all the folds and so on , it would have 400 sq . meters of surface .
and now this brain takes care over this , to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface and , of course , digest our food we cook .
so if we give you a specification , this brain , which is autonomous , have 500 million nerve cells , 100 million neurons — so around the size of a cat brain , so there sleeps a little cat — thinks for itself , optimizes whatever it digests .
it has autonomous organized microcircuits , has these programs which run .
if you do n't like a food , especially if you 're a child , you gag .
and then finally , it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery , which actually digests the food we cook .
now both look — and this is the blue arrows — both look to the same food , which is in the lumen and in the area of your intestine .
so if we take two types of signals — a hunger signal for example .
if you have an empty stomach , your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin .
`` it 's a very big signal ; it 's sent to the brain says , `` go and eat . '' ''
at least in my case , they are not listened to .
( laughter ) so what happens if the big brain in the integration overrides the signal ?
so if you override the hunger signal , you can have a disorder , which is called anorexia .
`` it actually takes the signal and changes it , and we continue , even [ though ] our eight signals would say , `` '' stop , enough . ''
`` we have transferred enough energy . '' '' now the interesting thing is that , along this lower layer — this gut — the signal becomes stronger and stronger if undigested , but digestible , material could penetrate . ''
this we found from bariatric surgery .
that then the signal would be very , very high .
now what would be the language we have to talk to the gut brain that its signals are so strong that the big brain can not ignore it ?
then we would generate something all of us would like to have — a balance between the hunger and the satiation .
this is fat digestion .
now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens , when the constituents are liberated , they disappear , they go away because they [ were ] absorbed .
actually , what happens is that a very intricate structure appears .
this whole system generates a huge surface to allow more enzymes to attack the remaining oil .
and finally , on your right side , you see a bubbly , cell-like structure appearing , from which the body will absorb the fat .
so our research — and i think the research also at the universities — are now fixing on these points to say : how can we actually — and this might sound trivial now to you — how can we change cooking ?
how can we cook that we have this language developed ?
if we add the matrix , if we add the structure language , which we have to learn , when we learn it , then we can put it back ; and around energy , we could generate a balance , which comes out from our really primordial operation : cooking .
2,800 dollars per species is the average .
that 's why we heard about the backing away from the kyoto protocol , for example .
after 9/11 , the tables were turned .
and the same problem with respect to islam .
some people say that democracy consists basically in elections .
you could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago , which was fear .
and by virtue of being technologies , they 're manipulable .
what does it mean to say that there 's an islamic democracy ?
it will be transformative of islam as well .
so the risks are very great .
and if we do , then i do n't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether .
thanks .
but the effect of that presentation is , it appeals to sympathy .
it will sit with those who create wealth .
aid increases the resources available to governments , and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have , as a person in africa seeking a career .
that , i think , is movement .
when my father and i started a company to 3d print human tissues and organs , some people initially thought we were a little crazy .
but since then , much progress has been made , both in our lab and other labs around the world .
`` and given this , we started getting questions like , `` '' if you can grow human body parts , can you also grow animal products like meat and leather ? '' '' when someone first suggested this to me , quite frankly i thought they were a little crazy , but what i soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all . ''
what 's crazy is what we do today .
but maintaining this herd takes a major toll on our planet .
animals are not just raw materials .
they 're living beings , and already our livestock is one of the largest users of land , fresh water , and one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases which drive climate change .
on top of this , when you get so many animals so close together , it creates a breeding ground for disease and opportunities for harm and abuse .
clearly , we can not continue on this path which puts the environment , public health , and food security at risk .
what if , instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal , we started with what the tissues are made of , the basic unit of life , the cell ?
already in medicine , biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts , like ears , windpipes , skin , blood vessels and bone , that have been successfully implanted into patients .
it is beautiful , and it has long been a part of our history .
it mainly uses one cell type , and it is largely two-dimensional .
in this sense , leather is a gateway material , a beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry .
now how do we do it ?
this takes millions of cells and expands them into billions .
and we then coax these cells to produce collagen , as they would naturally .
this collagen is the stuff between cells .
it 's natural connective tissue .
it 's the extracellular matrix , but in leather , it 's the main building block .
and finally , we take this multilayered skin and through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process , we create leather .
and so i 'm very excited to show you , for the first time , the first batch of our cultured leather , fresh from the lab .
it can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells , and better yet , there is no hair to remove , no scars or insect 's bites , and no waste .
this leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet , a handbag or a car seat .
this piece of leather is a mere seven tissue layers thick , and as you can see , it is nearly transparent .
and this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque .
you do n't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather .
this type of leather can do what today 's leather does , but with imagination , probably much more .
rather , it could be much more like this .
and speaking of food , our cultured food has evolved , and today we prepare cultured food in beautiful , sterile facilities like this .
imagine that in this facility , instead of brewing beer , we were brewing leather or meat .
imagine touring this facility , learning about how the leather or meat is cultured , seeing the process from beginning to end , and even trying some .
it 's clean , open and educational , and this is in contrast to the hidden , guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today .
perhaps biofabrication is a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind .
it 's environmentally responsible , efficient and humane .
it allows us to be creative .
we can design new materials , new products , and new facilities .
we need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved .
perhaps we are ready for something literally and figuratively more cultured .
everyone wonders about the next plane .
back home , raisuddin bhuiyan was a big man , an air force officer .
then , on september 21 , that tattooed man enters the mart .
`` `` '' excuse me ? '' '' raisuddin answers . ''
he recites verses from the koran , begging his god to live .
strangely , death row was the first institution that left stroman better .
and sent him on a journey of introspection and betterment .
he recalled promising god , as he lay dying in 2001 , that if he lived , he would serve humanity all his days .
i 'm jessi , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i 've got inside , i 'm going to make a very public confession , and that is , i 'm outfit-obsessed .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photographing and blogging a different , colorful , crazy outfit for every single occasion .
but i do n't buy anything new .
i get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores .
aww , thank you .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i 've won .
i want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what i packed for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?
so i 'm going to show you exactly what i brought .
exactly one week 's worth of undies is all i put in my suitcase .
i was betting that i 'd be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to palm springs .
and since you do n't know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear — ( laughter ) that means i found a few things .
does that sound good ?
( applause ) so as i do this , i 'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new .
so let 's start with sunday .
`` i call this `` '' shiny tiger . '' '' you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great . ''
you can almost always look phenomenal for under $ 50 .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that i wore the entire week .
monday : color is powerful .
it is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you 're wearing bright red pants .
( laughter ) if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
tuesday : fitting in is way overrated .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out .
but it was n't until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
if you believe you 're a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you ca n't pull off .
and finally , saturday : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase .
because the lesson i 'm trying to learn myself this week is that it 's okay to let go .
it starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits .
when i was a kid , i experienced something so powerful , i spent the rest of my life searching for it , and in all the wrong places .
what i experienced was n't virtual reality .
it was music .
and this is where the story begins .
`` that 's me , listening to the beatles ' `` '' white album . '' '' and the look on my face is the feeling that i 've been searching for ever since . ''
music goes straight to the emotional vein , into your bloodstream and right into your heart .
it deepens every experience .
fellas ?
music makes everything have more emotional resonance .
when i hear that one song from that one summer with that one girl , i 'm instantly transported back there again .
hey , stacey .
here 's a part of the story , though , where i got a little greedy .
i thought if i added more layers on top of the music , i could make the feelings even more powerful .
so i got into directing music videos .
this is what they looked like .
that 's my brother , jeff .
( laughter ) here 's me , just so we 're even .
except , i 'm not .
`` so aaron koblin and i began auditioning new technologies that could put more of you inside of the work , like your childhood home in `` '' the wilderness downtown , '' '' your hand-drawn portraits , in `` '' the johnny cash project , '' '' and your interactive dreams in `` '' 3 dreams of black . '' '' we were pushing beyond the screen , trying to connect more deeply to people 's hearts and imaginations . ''
but it was n't quite enough .
it still did n't have the raw experiential power of pure music for me .
and when i tried it , i knew i 'd found it .
i could taste the lightning .
i quickly started building things in this new medium , and through that process we realized something : that vr is going to play an incredibly important role in the history of mediums .
`` all of these mediums require what we call `` '' suspension of disbelief , '' '' because there 's a translation gap between the reality of the story and our consciousness interpreting the story into our reality . ''
virtual reality bridges that gap .
now , you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader .
in all other mediums , your consciousness interprets the medium .
but where are we now ?
what is the current state of the art ?
we are the equivalent of year one of cinema .
ok , here we go .
so , first : camera movement is tricky in vr .
the music guides you there .
it brings that character inside of your personal space , a space that we 'd usually reserve for the people that we love .
directing vr is not like directing for the rectangle .
it 's more of a choreography of the viewer 's attention .
so i can use that to direct your attention to where i want you to see .
that 's why it works as an empathy machine .
but where do we go from here ?
the format has never changed .
it 's not using physical celluloid or paper or tv signals .
we 're using your senses as the paints on the canvas , but only two right now .
what if instead of verbally telling you about a dream , i could let you live inside that dream ?
that 's not a virtual reality anymore .
but i hope you see where we 're going .
but here i am , intellectualizing a medium i 'm saying is experiential .
so let 's experience it .
let 's open the flap .
we played in cardboard boxes as kids , and as adults , i 'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning by sticking our head in one again .
you 're about to participate in the largest collective vr viewing in history .
( video ) woman 's voice : dear lord , protect us from evil , for you are the lord , the light .
let your will be done .
help us to live again .
( applause ) i believe that everyone on earth needs to experience what you just experienced .
that way we can collectively start to shape this , not as a tech platform but as a humanity platform .
look familiar ?
now , millions of kids just had the same formative experience in their childhood that i had in mine .
first , i do n't have a mobile , so i 'm on the safe side .
and plus , i 'm not going to give you any answers .
i 'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we 're talking about .
there is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me .
you people , the church of ted , are a very optimistic community .
but then the rain stopped , people went to vote .
you know who to arrest , who to negotiate with .
but what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot ?
basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for .
according to the latest survey being done by the european commission , 89 percent of the citizens of europe believe that there is a growing gap between the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public .
so basically i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ?
and i 'll start with what went right .
so i do believe that even things like that are very much the children of '68 — nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then .
but after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s .
`` and nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it , the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message : `` the government does not know better . '' ''
and of course , you have 1989 — the end of communism , the end of the cold war .
and it was the birth of the global world .
so this is what went right .
but if we 're going to see what went wrong , we 're going to end up with the same five revolutions .
we start to like divorcing , if we 're married at all .
and you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies .
remember , until the 1970s , the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality .
the more democratic our societies have been , the more equal they have been becoming .
now we have the reverse tendency .
`` and if you go to 1989 — something that basically you do n't expect that anybody 's going to criticize — but many are going to tell you , `` '' listen , it was the end of the cold war that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in western europe . '' '' when the soviet union was still there , the rich and the powerful , they needed the people , because they feared them . ''
now the elites basically have been liberated .
they 're very mobile . you can not tax them .
and basically they do n't fear the people .
so as a result of it , you have this very strange situation in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
and it 's becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are not like you .
this is the other side of the things that we like .
and you have this very strongly to the extent that , even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days , these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas .
before , revolutions used to have ideological names .
they could be communist , they could be liberal , they could be fascist or islamic .
you have facebook revolutions , twitter revolutions .
i 'm saying this because one of my major points is what went right is also what went wrong .
and when we 're now trying to see how we can change the situation , when basically we 're trying to see what can be done about democracy , we should keep this ambiguity in mind .
because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most .
this is probably true .
`` but i do believe that we should be also very clear that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics where the message is , `` '' it 's transparency , stupid . '' '' transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions . ''
transparency is politics ' management of mistrust .
and by the way , mistrust was always very important for democracy .
it 's not going to be the big brother watching you , it 's going to be we being the big brother watching the political class .
but is this the idea of a free society ?
for example , can you imagine that decent , civic , talented people are going to run for office if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust ?
are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues , are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat their positions , even the very wrong positions , because consistency is going to be more important than common sense ?
i find this extremely important , because democracy is about people changing their views based on rational arguments and discussions .
and i do believe that when we 're discussing politics these days , probably it makes sense to look also at this type of a story .
[ regardless of ] how transparent our governments want to be , they 're going to be selectively transparent .
so i had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister , why he made this decision .
`` and this is goethe , who is neither bulgarian nor a political scientist , some centuries ago he said , `` there is a big shadow where there is much light . '' ''
thank you very much .
we 've all done this .
and here 's what i learned from laboring women .
i 'll never forget the magic that would happen when a woman stopped resisting the pain and opened .
stay curious .
and all the while , underneath surface time is this whole other dimension where the past and the present and the future merge and become deep time .
and there 's nowhere to get to .
and he said when he experienced it , he knew sacred awe .
and i got a big dose of sacred awe .
and three : every now and then , step off your hamster wheel into deep time .
two years ago , my younger sister came out of remission from a rare blood cancer , and the only treatment left for her was a bone marrow transplant .
but there 's also jealousy and competition and rejection and attack .
in siblinghood , that 's where we start assembling many of those first layers that cover our soul .
and her body might reject my cells .
could we merge ?
the past and the present merged .
i was paid in love .
i said my truths , but more important than that , i sought the truth of others .
it was n't until the final chapter of this story that i realized just how well midwifery had trained me .
it was my blood , her blood , our blood .
we can all do this .
we can do this for the soul of the world .
thank you .
and i 'm going to only talk about the mass .
now , the key here is to figure out what that schwarzschild radius is .
it depends only on the mass of the object .
i have told you my job is to get it down to the schwarzchild radius .
and it 's a very fragile entity .
it strips that gas cloud apart .
they liberated my birth town .
i wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation , sharing some of the problems .
a goal i had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems , because i think there are some very important problems that do n't get worked on naturally .
that is , the market does not drive the scientists , the communicators , the thinkers , the governments to do the right things .
so this morning i 'm going to share two of these problems and talk about where they stand .
and part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past .
another statistic , perhaps my favorite , is to look at childhood deaths .
as recently as 1960 , 110 million children were born , and 20 million of those died before the age of five .
so that 's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate .
each one of those lives matters a lot .
the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again .
and i think that 's doable in well under 20 years .
it 's been a severe disease for thousands of years .
in fact , if we look at the genetic code , it 's the only disease we can see that people who lived in africa actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths .
deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s .
so it was absolutely gigantic .
a terrible disease . it was in the united states . it was in europe .
people did n't know what caused it until the early 1900s , when a british military man figured out that it was mosquitos .
one was killing the mosquitos with ddt .
the other was treating the patients with quinine , or quinine derivatives .
so we can see : 1900 , it 's everywhere .
1945 , it 's still most places .
1970 , the u.s. and most of europe have gotten rid of it .
1990 , you 've gotten most of the northern areas .
now , baldness , it 's a terrible thing .
( laughter ) and rich men are afflicted .
but , malaria — even the million deaths a year caused by malaria greatly understate its impact .
it means that you ca n't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
we 'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit .
( laughter ) ( applause ) those mosquitos are not infected .
what it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night , so the mosquitos that bite late at night ca n't get at them .
it 's great to see .
but we have to be careful because malaria — the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves .
and so you end up with two choices .
if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way , you do it vigorously , you can actually get a local eradication .
or , if you go in kind of half-heartedly , for a period of time you 'll reduce the disease burden , but eventually those tools will become ineffective , and the death rate will soar back up again .
now we 're on the upswing .
there 's new drug discovery going on .
our foundation has backed a vaccine that 's going into phase three trial that starts in a couple months .
and that should save over two thirds of the lives if it 's effective .
because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things .
it involves communicators to keep the funding high , to keep the visibility high , to tell the success stories .
it involves social scientists , so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets , but 90 percent .
of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise .
we need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things .
and so as these elements come together , i 'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria .
now let me turn to a second question , a fairly different question , but i 'd say equally important .
and this is : how do you make a teacher great ?
let 's start with why this is important .
i had great teachers .
in fact , in the united states , the teaching system has worked fairly well .
there are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places .
so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education .
and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world , if you measure them against the other top 20 percent .
and they 've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology and keep the u.s. at the forefront .
now , the strength for those top 20 percent is starting to fade on a relative basis , but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting .
and we have to change this .
we have to change it so that people have equal opportunity .
we have to change it so that the country is strong and stays at the forefront of things that are driven by advanced education , like science and mathematics .
and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year .
because they were n't tracking where the kids were before that .
for minority kids , it 's over 50 percent .
and even if you graduate from high school , if you 're low-income , you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree .
if you 're low-income in the united states , you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree .
there 's many people working on it .
but the more we looked at it , the more we realized that having great teachers was the very key thing .
and we hooked up with some people studying how much variation is there between teachers , between , say , the top quartile — the very best — and the bottom quartile .
what does that mean ?
that means that if the entire u.s. , for two years , had top quartile teachers , the entire difference between us and asia would go away .
so , it 's simple . all you need are those top quartile teachers .
`` we should find out what they 're doing and transfer that skill to other people . '' '' but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today . ''
what are the characteristics of this top quartile ?
and the answer is no .
the variation is very , very small .
this chart takes four different factors and says how much do they explain teaching quality .
that bottom thing , which says there 's no effect at all , is a master 's degree .
one is seniority .
because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension .
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .
for math teachers majoring in math there 's a measurable effect .
there are some people who are very good at this .
`` you might say , `` '' do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher 's leave ? '' '' the answer is , on average , the slightly better teachers leave the system . ''
and it 's a system with very high turnover .
kipp means knowledge is power .
it 's an unbelievable thing .
they have 66 schools — mostly middle schools , some high schools — and what goes on is great teaching .
they 're team teaching . they 're constantly improving their teachers .
`` they 're taking data , the test scores , and saying to a teacher , `` '' hey , you caused this amount of increase . '' '' they 're deeply engaged in making teaching better . ''
when you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms , at first it 's very bizarre .
`` i thought , `` '' i 'm in the sports rally or something . ''
`` what 's going on ? '' '' and the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids were n't paying attention , which kids were bored , and calling kids rapidly , putting things up on the board . ''
everybody needs to be involved .
and so kipp is doing it .
in the teacher 's contract , it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom — sometimes to once per year .
and so that 's sort of working in the opposite direction .
putting a few cameras in the classroom and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis is very practical in all public schools .
`` and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say , `` '' ok , here 's a little clip of something i thought i did well . ''
`` advise me — when this kid acted up , how should i have dealt with that ? '' '' and they could all sit and work together on those problems . ''
you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it , have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff .
you can take those great courses and make them available so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course , learn from that .
if you have a kid who 's behind , you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept .
and in fact , these free courses could not only be available just on the internet , but you could make it so that dvds were always available , and so anybody who has access to a dvd player can have the very best teachers .
and so by thinking of this as a personnel system , we can do it much better .
( applause ) now , we put a lot of money into education , and i really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have .
i think people are beginning to recognize how important this is , and it really can make a difference for millions of lives , if we get it right .
i only had time to frame those two problems .
and the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad .
you know , the system does n't naturally make it happen .
governments do n't naturally pick these things in the right way .
the private sector does n't naturally put its resources into these things .
thank you .
( applause )
i mean , just think about that .
( applause )
girl 4 : we make a school newspaper on the computer .
miko : hey rockett ! c'mere !
i feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the museum of modern art on a retrospective of painter elizabeth murray .
there were some motifs and elements that would come up again later in her life .
i remember asking her what she thought of those early works .
she told me that a few did n't quite meet her own mark for what she wanted them to be .
in that moment , my view of success and creativity changed .
this is a question i 've long asked myself .
i think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win .
i wanted to see what 's called archer 's paradox , the idea that in order to actually hit your target , you have to aim at something slightly skew from it .
one held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching .
i stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support , and watched her , and i did n't understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring .
and i saw that gave her more tenacity , and she went after it again and again .
at the end of the practice , one of the archers was so taxed that she lied out on the ground just star-fished , her head looking up at the sky , trying to find what t.s . eliot might call that still point of the turning world .
but i stayed because i realized i was witnessing what 's so rare to glimpse , that difference between success and mastery .
how many times have we designated something a classic , a masterpiece even , while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished , riddled with difficulties and flaws , in other words , a near win ?
franz kafka saw incompletion when others would find only works to praise , so much so that he wanted all of his diaries , manuscripts , letters and even sketches burned upon his death .
`` his friend refused to honor the request , and because of that , we now have all the works we now do by kafka : `` america , '' `` the trial '' and `` the castle , '' a work so incomplete it even stops mid-sentence . ''
we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge .
part of the reason that the near win is inbuilt to mastery is because the greater our proficiency , the more clearly we might see that we do n't know all that we thought we did .
it 's called the dunning–kruger effect .
`` the paris review got it out of james baldwin when they asked him , `` what do you think increases with knowledge ? '' ''
the reason the near win has a propulsion is because it changes our view of the landscape and puts our goals , which we tend to put at a distance , into more proximate vicinity to where we stand .
we thrive not when we 've done it all , but when we still have more to do .
we know that we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge , and it 's why the deliberate incomplete is inbuilt into creation myths .
thank you .
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit , so i 'm going to dive straight in , right at the point where i get this thing to work .
here we go . i 'm going to talk about five different things .
that was easy . ok .
if i project that , that would make me think that i would live until 120 if i do n't crash on my motorbike .
i never did , though .
and i had not saved her .
that is real suffering , and that is a real story .
let me show you what i mean .
that is food and care and shelter .
it 's found in thailand 's fishing industry .
the scheme in that case was incredible .
let me tell you what that looks like .
so , like the journalist i am , i started digging into the agricultural sector .
and i found there are too many fields , and too few labor inspectors .
and i would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation .
and all of this had been hidden to me , before i had tried to understand it .
i was n't the only person grappling with these issues .
if we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers ?
but that is not my experience of them .
each one of us is more than what we have lived through .
especially trafficking survivors .
they were the emissaries of hope .
these survivors do n't need saving .
this is our chance to do the same .
i was so reluctant to share my story of my auntie with you .
i also have n't done my journalistic due diligence on this .
and i finished high school .
and it 's a really poor area .
`` and that man told me , `` '' so , here you are . ''
these days , i call myself a graphic artist .
and puzzling it is .
each one of them is completely different .
i 'm a physician trained in infectious diseases , and following my training , i moved to somalia from san francisco .
but i landed in a refugee situation that had a million refugees in 40 camps , and there were six of us doctors .
there were many epidemics there .
my responsibilities were largely related to tuberculosis , and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera .
so it was the spread of tuberculosis and the spread of cholera that i was responsible for inhibiting .
and my last assignment there was to run a unit called intervention development , which was responsible for designing interventions .
after 10 years of working overseas , i was exhausted .
i really had very little left .
i had been traveling to one country after another .
i was emotionally feeling very isolated .
i wanted to come home .
it 's full of panic and fear , and i 'd heard the women wailing and crying in the desert .
and i wanted to come home and take a break and maybe start over .
i was not aware of any epidemic problems in america .
in fact , i was n't aware of any problems in america .
and in fact i would visit friends of mine , and i noticed that they had water that came right into their homes .
how many of you have such a situation ?
( laughter ) and some of them , many of them actually , had water that came into more than one room .
what are you in america doing about it ?
and one was punishment .
it was not a main driver of behavior , nor was it a main driver of behavior change .
and besides that , it reminded me of ancient epidemics that were previously completely misunderstood because the science had n't been there before , epidemics of plague or typhus or leprosy , where the prevalent ideas were that there were bad people or bad humors or bad air , and widows were dragged around the moat , and dungeons were part of the solution .
and i 'd heard this before as well .
and so the sense that i had was there was a giant gap here .
frequently , a strategy has to be rethought .
it 's not as if i had any idea what it would look like , but there was a sense that we would have to do something with new categories of workers and something having to do with behavior change and something having to do with public education .
what do the graphs look like ?
what does the data look like ?
this reminded me of clustering that we 'd seen also in infectious epidemics , for example cholera .
and it also looked like infectious epidemics .
and it turns out that the greatest predictor of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence .
in other words , for t.b . you have to find somebody who has active t.b . who is infecting other people .
and the second thing to do , of course , is to prevent further spread , that means to find who else has been exposed , but may not be spreading so much right now like someone with a smaller case of t.b. , or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods , but in the same group , and then they need to be , in a way , managed as well , particular to the specific disease process .
and then the third part , the shifting the norms , and that means a whole bunch of community activities , remodeling , public education , and then you 've got what you might call group immunity .
and that combination of factors is how the aids epidemic in uganda was very successfully reversed .
and then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the united states at the time .
so violence interruptors hired from the same group , credibility , trust , access , just like the health workers in somalia , but designed for a different category , and trained in persuasion , cooling people down , buying time , reframing .
just like t.b. , but the object is behavior change .
now our first experiment of this resulted in a 67-percent drop in shootings and killings in the west garfield neighborhood of chicago .
( applause ) and this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself , first 50 or 60 days , then 90 days , and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another 90 days , and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon .
they were using parks they were n't using before .
`` but of course , the funders said , `` '' wait a second , do it again . '' '' and so we had to then , fortunately , get the funds to repeat this experience , and this is one of the next four neighborhoods that had a 45-percent drop in shootings and killings . ''
and since that time , this has been replicated 20 times .
there have been independent evaluations supported by the justice department and by the cdc and performed by johns hopkins that have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent reductions in shootings and killings using this new method .
`` the economist in 2009 said this is `` '' the approach that will come to prominence . '' '' and even a movie was made around our work . ''
[ the interrupters ] however , not so fast , because a lot of people did not agree with this way of going about it .
and there 's whole industries designed for managing bad people .
what do you mean , hiring people who have backgrounds ?
`` my business friends said , `` '' gary , you 're being criticized tremendously . ''
yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce hiv and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful economies without healing the economy .
chicago and new orleans , the health departments are having a very large role in this .
trauma centers and hospitals are doing their part in stepping up .
and the u.s. conference of mayors has endorsed not only the approach but the specific model .
and recently , the institute of medicine came out with a workshop report which went through some of the data , including the neuroscience , on how this problem is really transmitted .
it gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility of replacing some of these prisons with playgrounds or parks , and to consider the possibility of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods , and to allow there to be a new strategy , a new set of methods , a new set of workers : science , in a way , replacing morality .
and moving away from emotions is the most important part of the solution to science as a more important part of the solution .
so i did n't mean to come up with this at all .
for myself , i tried to get away from infectious diseases , and i did n't .
but they just do n't seem to get through .
and i think i 've worked out why .
we 're just going to pour that in there .
so we 're just going to put that in there as well .
the lifesaver bottle works really simply .
let 's see chris 's program throughout the rest of the show . okay ?
`` so here is the `` '' thinking different '' '' bit . ''
but this story 's not about eliminating it , it 's about minimizing it .
it literally is waterhouse .
the people 's supermarket .
i 'm going to get there before you .
we also have transgenesis .
this is a chicken with teeth .
and so that 's what we 're looking into .
and on the other side there was a rising sun .
well , in a balloon it 's easy , we have ballast .
and i think in life it should be exactly like this .
this is very practical .
this can be in politics .
but we were expected to have doubts ; we 're expected to have fears .
we changed completely our strategy .
64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot , the batteries , flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency .
so when we talk about elections , we in established democracies , we know what we 're talking about .
we 've got the words . we have the vocabulary .
we know what a polling station is .
i specialize in public outreach .
it actually means designing information campaigns so that candidates and voters who have never had the opportunity to participate or to vote understand where , when , how to register ; where , when , how to vote ; why , why it is important to take part .
young people as well .
it 's a country with high levels of illiteracy , and the thing about that was , it was in 2005 , and we organized two elections on the same day .
we had 330 for 54 seats .
it 's the size of a newspaper .
even more .
so you see , we did use a lot of symbols and things like that .
and we had other problems in southern sudan .
southern sudan was a very different story .
for example — i mean , it 's a country the size of texas , more or less .
it was very complicated , so using verbal communication was obviously the way to go , but there were 132 languages .
then i arrived in tunisia in 2011 .
it was the arab spring .
it was an enormous , enormous historical moment .
`` this means `` '' to notice '' '' in a passive sort of sense , as in , `` '' i noticed he was wearing a light blue shirt . '' '' did i go and check whether the shirt was light blue or not ? ''
`` and then i got wind of the fact that in egypt , they were using this term `` '' mutabi’ , '' '' which means `` '' to follow . '' '' so we were now having followers of an election . ''
`` so that 's not quite right either , because there is a term that 's already accepted and in use , which was the word `` '' muraqib '' '' which means `` '' a controller . '' '' it 's got that notion of control . ''
and with our colleagues , we thought perhaps it 's our role to actually help make sure that the words are understood and actually create a work of reference that could be used across the arab region .
it meant actually defining 481 terms which formed the basis of everything you need to know if you 're going to organize a democratic election .
`` `` '' yes , we understand the definition . ''
we were trying to facilitate understanding among people .
so this , i 'm happy to say , it took three years to produce this because we also finalized the draft and took it actually into the field , sat with the election commissions in all these different countries , debated and defined and refined the draft , and finally published it in november 2014 in cairo .
i heard just recently from a colleague that they 've taken it up in somalia .
so that 's very good to know .
and this newly formed arab organization for electoral management bodies , which is trying to professionalize how elections are run in the region , they 're using it as well .
however , this work of reference is quite high-pitched .
but the people of the middle east have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education .
it 's part of our curriculum at school .
we hear about sectarianism and all this horrible negative news that comes to us all the time .
the silent majority needs to know .
it is time to provide people with the knowledge tools that they can inform themselves with .
the silent majority does not need to be silent .
man , her office was packed .
but that does n't mean that we ca n't .
like , i remember one day i found my dad convulsing , foaming at the mouth , od-ing on the bathroom floor .
`` so my mom said , `` '' you 're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day . '' '' so for the next two years , that 's what i did . ''
and eventually , i ended up at a school where there was a mixture .
you just had to do things sometimes .
`` so there were a lot of teachers who were like , `` '' she 's never going to make it . ''
but then , they were very surprised when i graduated from high school .
i was accepted to pepperdine university , and i came back to the same school that i attended to be a special ed assistant .
and so every year , i share my background with my kids , because they need to know that everyone has a story , everyone has a struggle , and everyone needs help along the way .
and i am going to be their help along the way .
so as a rookie teacher , i created opportunity .
how do you get to build those relationships ?
we wanted those freedoms .
but now , shifting an entire paradigm , it has n't been an easy journey , nor is it even complete .
but we had to do it .
our community deserved a new way of doing things .
and as the very first pilot middle school in all of los angeles unified school district , you better believe there was some opposition .
and it was out of fear — fear of , well , what if they get it wrong ?
yeah , what if we get it wrong ?
so even though teachers were against it because we employ one-year contracts — you ca n't teach , or you do n't want to teach , you do n't get to be at my school with my kids .
laptops , computers , tablets — you name it , they have it .
and because we connect it to what they 're doing — for example , they made public service announcements for the cancer society .
these were played in the local trolley system .
because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live ?
thank you .
he was 94 when this photograph was taken .
in the 1930s , roosevelt put thousands and thousands of americans back to work by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels , but he also did something interesting , which was to hire a few hundred writers to scour america to capture the stories of ordinary americans .
the idea is very , very simple .
`` [ danny perasa to his wife annie perasa married 26 years ] danny perasa : see , the thing of it is , i always feel guilty when i say `` '' i love you '' '' to you , and i say it so often . i say it to remind you that as dumpy as i am , it 's coming from me , it 's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio , and it 's nice of you to keep the radio around the house . ''
( laughter ) [ michael wolmetz with his girlfriend debora brakarz ] michael wolmetz : so this is the ring that my father gave to my mother , and we can leave it there .
and he saved up and he purchased this , and he proposed to my mother with this , and so i thought that i would give it to you so that he could be with us for this also .
so i 'm going to share a mic with you right now , debora .
where 's the right finger ?
debora brakarz : ( crying ) mw : debora , will you please marry me ?
my grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years .
he used to pick people up here every day .
the entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself .
and that motion of building an institution out of a moment of conversation and listening is actually a lot of what my firm , local projects , is doing with our engagements in general .
so we 're a media design firm , and we 're working with a broad array of different institutions building media installations for museums and public spaces .
our latest engagement is the cleveland museum of art , which we 've created an engagement called gallery one for .
and gallery one is an interesting project because it started with this massive , $ 350 million expansion for the cleveland museum of art , and we actually brought in this piece specifically to grow new capacity , new audiences , at the same time that the museum itself is growing .
`` visitors are transient . we want people who live here , people who have ownership . '' '' and so what we 're doing is making a broad array of different ways for people to actually engage with the material inside of these galleries , so you can still have a traditional gallery experience , but if you 're interested , you can actually engage with any individual artwork and see the original context from where it 's from , or manipulate the work itself . ''
so , for example , you can click on this individual lion head , and this is where it originated from , 1300 b.c .
it 's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse the actual museum 's collection using facial recognition .
so this person 's making different faces , and it 's actually drawing forth different objects from the collection that connect with exactly how she 's looking .
and so you can imagine that , as people are performing inside of the museum itself , you get this sense of this emotional connection , this way in which our face connects with the thousands and tens of thousands of years .
so more and more we 're trying to find ways for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves , to be creative even as they 're looking at other people 's creativity and understanding them .
and of course the event itself is so recent , somewhere between history and current events , it was a huge challenge to imagine how do you actually live up to a space like this , an event like this , to actually tell that story .
so it 's estimated that a third of the world watched 9/11 live , and a third of the world heard about it within 24 hours , making it really by nature of when it happened , this unprecedented moment of global awareness .
and so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world , through video , through photos , through written history , and so people 's experiences on that day , which was , in fact , this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this open platform .
this is a shot from the brooklyn-battery tunnel .
we ca n't have just a historian or a curator narrating objectively in the third person about an event like that , when you have the witnesses to history who are going to make their way through the actual museum itself .
and so we started imagining the museum , along with the creative team at the museum and the curators , thinking about how the first voice that you would hear inside the museum would actually be of other visitors .
and so we created this idea of an opening gallery called we remember .
and i 'll just play you part of a mockup of it , but you get a sense of what it 's like to actually enter into that moment in time and be transported back in history .
( multiple voices ) voice 7 : it was probably about 11 o'clock at night .
voice 8 : i was driving to work at 5:45 local time in the morning .
voice 11 : when i heard it over the radio — voice 12 : heard it on the radio .
( multiple voices ) voice 13 : i got a call from my father . voice 14 : the phone rang , it woke me up .
and we tell the stories of being inside the towers through that same audio collage , so you 're hearing people literally talking about seeing the planes as they make their way into the building , or making their way down the stairwells .
and as you make your way into the exhibition where it talks about the recovery , we actually project directly onto these moments of twisted steel all of the experiences from people who literally excavated on top of the pile itself .
and so you can hear oral histories — so people who were actually working the so-called bucket brigades as you 're seeing literally the thousands of experiences from that moment .
and as you leave that storytelling moment understanding about 9/11 , we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening and actually talk to the individual visitors and ask them their own experiences about 9/11 .
and we ask them questions that are actually not really answerable , the types of questions that 9/11 itself draws forth for all of us .
`` `` how could 9/11 have happened ? '' ''
`` `` and how did the world change after 9/11 ? '' ''
and suddenly the institution , once again , turns into a listening experience .
so i 'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices , but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone 's reflection on the event .
voice 2 : it 's something that we shared , and it 's something that united us .
jb : and so as people make their way out of the museum , reflecting on the experience , reflecting on their own thoughts of it , they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself , because they 've gone back up to grade , and we actually got involved in the memorial after we 'd done the museum for a few years .
the original designer of the memorial , michael arad , had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated , almost random , really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself , but it was a huge challenge for the families , for the foundation , certainly for the first responders , and there was a negotiation that went forth and a solution was found to actually create not an order in terms of chronology , or in terms of alphabetical , but through what 's called meaningful adjacency .
so these are groupings of the names themselves which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order , and we , along with jer thorp , created an algorithm to take massive amounts of data to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves .
you can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial , and you can search for an individual name , or in this case an employer , cantor fitzgerald , and see the way in which all of those names , those hundreds of names , are actually organized onto the memorial itself , and use that to navigate the memorial .
and more importantly , when you 're actually at the site of the memorial , you can see those connections .
in this case , harry ramos , who was the head trader at an investment bank , who stopped to aid victor wald on the 55th floor of the south tower .
and wald 's widow requested that they be listed next to each other .
three generations ago , we had to actually get people to go out and capture the stories for common people .
today , of course , there 's an unprecedented amount of stories for all of us that are being captured for future generations .
and this is our hope , that 's there 's poetry inside of each of our stories .
thank you very much .
( applause )
allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone .
you know that all over the world , people fight for their freedom , fight for their rights .
some battle oppressive governments .
allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes .
let me take you back two years ago in my life .
`` after finishing his bedtime rituals , he looked at me and he asked a question : `` mommy , are we bad people ? '' ''
`` `` why do you say such things , aboody ? '' ''
earlier that day , i noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school .
he would n't tell me what happened .
[ but now ] he was ready to tell .
`` `` '' two boys hit me today in school . ''
they told me , 'we saw your mom on facebook .
but those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth , when it all came together .
you see , i 'm a saudi woman who had been put in jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars .
i was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings , in the streets and in schools .
it was a punishment for daring to challenge the society 's rules .
it was may , 2011 , and i was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments i had to face trying to find a ride back home , although i have a car and an international driver 's license .
as long as i 've known , women in saudi arabia have been always complaining about the ban , but it 's been 20 years since anyone tried to do anything about it , a whole generation ago .
he broke the good/bad news in my face .
`` `` but there is no law banning you from driving . '' ''
there was n't an actual law in saudi arabia .
it was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women .
`` it was a few weeks later , we started receiving all these `` man wolves will rape you if you go and drive . '' ''
we needed proof .
so i drove . i posted a video on youtube .
what happened next , of course ?
i started receiving threats to be killed , raped , just to stop this campaign .
i was in the campaign with other saudi women and even men activists .
so this time i asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car .
arrested again , he was sent to detention for one day , and i was sent to jail .
i was released after nine days .
june 17 comes .
allow me to help you answer this question .
we started a hashtag on twitter mocking the study , and it made headlines around the world .
it strips it away of its strongest weapon : fear .
it was about living two totally different perceptions of my personality , of my person — the villain back in my home country , and the hero outside .
just to tell you , two stories happened in the last two years .
but in my home country , it was a totally different picture .
ah , it 's okay . this is my favorite .
so it 's a totally different picture .
i was asked last year to give a speech at the oslo freedom forum .
i was surrounded by this love and the support of people around me , and they looked at me as an inspiration .
at the same time , i flew back to my home country , they hated that speech so much .
they even started a poll .
more than 13,000 voters answered this poll : whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech .
ninety percent said yes , she 's a traitor .
so it 's these two totally different perceptions of my personality .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you . ( applause )
but you learn lessons from these things that happen to you .
i learned to be always there .
the first thing , i got out of jail , of course after i took a shower , i went online , i opened my twitter account and my facebook page , and i 've been always very respectful to those people who are opining to me .
i would use actions . when they said i should withdraw from the campaign , i filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver 's license .
the shura council that 's appointed by the king , by royal decree of king abdullah , last year there were 30 women assigned to that council , like 20 percent .
after being sent to jail or sentenced lashing , or sent to a trial , the spokesperson of the traffic police said , we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers .
so for me , it 's not about only these small steps .
it 's about women themselves .
`` a friend once asked me , she said , `` so when do you think this women driving will happen ? '' ''
so i have no clue , really , how i became an activist .
i hope you find clues to answer that from my speech .
thank you , everyone .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
we work at the level of the sentence , maybe the paragraph , the words , the punctuation .
our business is in the details .
every publication has a house style .
we sometimes get teased for our style .
`` imagine — we still spell `` '' teen-ager '' '' with a hyphen , as if that word had just been coined . ''
copyediting at the new yorker is a mechanical process .
there is a related role called query proofreading , or page-ok'ing .
if we do our job well , we 're invisible , but as soon as we make a mistake , we copy editors become glaringly visible .
here is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door .
`` come on ! get it together . '' '' belie : to give a false impression . ''
i feel disloyal divulging them here , so let 's have look at what we do right .
somehow , i 've gotten a reputation for sternness .
but i work with writers who know how to have their way with me .
`` i 've known ian frazier , or `` '' sandy , '' '' since the early 80s . ''
here is one from a story about staten island after hurricane sandy : [ a dock that had been broken in the middle and lost its other half sloped down toward the water , its support pipes and wires leaning forward like when you open a box of linguine and it slides out . ] ( laughter ) this would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore .
( laughter ) i decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on sandy and let the sentence stand . ( laughter )
`` i told sandy that not long ago in a moment of indiscretion and he said , `` only three ? '' ''
there were three things in it that i had to challenge .
first , a grammar query .
`` but people say things like , `` '' everyone held their breath '' '' all the time . ''
nope .
`` i tried again : `` '' all those present held their breath ? '' '' i thought this sounded vaguely judicial . ''
two out of three is n't bad .
in the same issue , in that piece on doggie bags in france , there was the gratuitous use of the f-word by a frenchman .
i wonder , when the mail comes in , which will have offended the readers more .
the dog does n't speak english , or american , or spanish , or french .
people here get very confused about what a punishment is .
and the seminal moment was , i was getting on a plane in dallas , and in row two was a father , i presume , and a young boy about five , kicking the back of the chair .
`` and ugly face is this — when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child , you say , `` '' what are you doing ! now stop it , stop it , stop it ! '' '' and i went , `` '' oh my god , do i do something ? '' '' that child has lost everything — that one of the two people he can trust in this world has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet . ''
( laughter ) if he had kicked a dog , i would have punched him out .
he kicked a child , grabs the child like this and i let it go .
you know , kind of like a little robot .
and when it happens , it 's bad , it 's nasty .
you see it 's especially in families , especially with spouses , especially with children , especially with parents .
you see it especially in the workplace , especially from boss to employee .
it 's as if there 's some schadenfreude there , that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong , so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them .
it really is .
geometry , fantastic . you know , quantum mechanics — these are cool things .
but they do n't save marriages and they do n't raise children .
this should be taught in schools .
relationships — how do you negotiate ?
how you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy ?
so , that would be my wish to the future .
some of them are artificial .
now , what good is it to have that ?
you have formulas that long .
and you crank it several times .
this comes out . this comes out .
so where did this come from ?
well , let me finish .
hi . i 'm here to talk about congestion , namely road congestion .
road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon .
i mean , think about how different cities are , actually .
it 's moving by itself , okay .
and then you have the emerging world cities , with a mixed variety of vehicles , mixed land-use patterns , also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core .
but all of these attempts have one thing in common .
they 're basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving .
now , planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do , and let me tell you a story .
`` back in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , an urban planner in london got a phone call from a colleague in moscow saying , basically , `` '' hi , this is vladimir . i 'd like to know , who 's in charge of london 's bread supply ? '' '' and the urban planner in london goes , `` '' what do you mean , who 's in charge of london 's — i mean , no one is in charge . '' '' `` `` oh , but surely someone must be in charge . ''
`` i mean , it 's a very complicated system . someone must control all of this . '' '' `` `` no . no . no one is in charge . ''
`` it basically organizes itself . '' '' it organizes itself . ''
that 's an example of a complex social system which has the ability of self-organizing , and this is a very deep insight .
you do n't plan the details , and people will figure out what to do , how to adapt to this new framework .
and let 's now look at how we can use this insight to combat road congestion .
this is a map of stockholm , my hometown .
and these red dots show the most congested parts , which are the bridges that lead into the inner city .
and then someone came up with the idea that , apart from good public transport , apart from spending money on roads , let 's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks .
now , one or two euros , that is n't really a lot of money , i mean compared to parking charges and running costs , etc. , so you would probably expect that car drivers would n't really react to this fairly small charge .
now , that 's also wrong , because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really , really rapidly .
but fortunately , it also works the other way around .
if you can reduce traffic even somewhat , then congestion will go down much faster than you might think .
the first day with the congestion charges looked like this .
this is what happens when you take away 20 percent of the cars from the streets .
you really reduce congestion quite substantially .
but , well , as i said , i mean , car drivers adapt , right ?
so after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges .
wrong again . it 's now six and a half years ago since the congestion charges were introduced in stockholm , and we basically have the same low traffic levels still .
but you see , there 's an interesting gap here in the time series in 2007 .
well , the thing is that , the congestion charges , they were introduced first as a trial , so they were introduced in january and then abolished again at the end of july , followed by a referendum , and then they were reintroduced again in 2007 , which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity .
and personally , i would like to do this every once a year or so , but they wo n't let me do that .
but it was fun anyway .
so , we followed up . what happened ?
this is the last day with the congestion charges , july 31 , and you see the same street but now it 's summer , and summer in stockholm is a very nice and light time of the year , and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this .
the first day they all came back .
seventy percent of the population did n't want this .
but what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect , that people hated it more and more .
well , so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services , and tried to figure out who changed , and where did they go ?
and it turned out that they do n't know themselves . ( laughter ) for some reason , the car drivers are — they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do .
each day , people make new decisions , and people change and the world changes around them , and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people do n't even notice .
who changed their opinion , and why ?
which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with 20 percent , and reduced congestion by enormous numbers , and people are n't even aware that they have changed , and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along .
this is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems , and when you do that , you should n't try to tell people how to adapt .
and if you do it right , people will actually embrace the change , and if you do it right , people will actually even like it .
is it going to be so many different countries ?
thank you .
and this is the type of building we were shown as an example , to my team and myself , of what we had to design .
second , they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside , and then you need a lot of cooling .
and also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity .
but the question was how we could do a multistory , contemporary building with these principles .
the next challenge was when we looked at the site , that is , in a really growing area of the city , where most of these buildings that you see in the image , they were not there .
so the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entrances of the building .
and i started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in , and also the light , but in a filtered way .
and then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the ethiopian women 's dresses .
and we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building .
and this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night .
`` with these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like , `` this is not a shopping mall . we did n't ask for that . '' ''
and also that the idea of the facade was much , much cheaper , not only because of the material compared with the glass , but also because we did n't need to have air conditioning anymore .
and the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day .
and then under those panels we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars that would create this urban oasis .
hopefully by the beginning of next year , because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction .
and for doing such a big project , the biggest project i 've ever designed , i really needed to understand the city of tunis , but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture .
and the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan .
so we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction .
it has these blocks with courtyards , and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians .
and it also reinforces this idea of the gates .
and it 's where all the neighbors , they can go up and socialize , and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning , jumping from one building to another .
and also , they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing .
in these cities , the impact of architecture in people 's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow .
for this reason , i see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people .
thank you very much .
we live in a very complex environment : complexity and dynamism and patterns of evidence from satellite photographs , from videos .
you can even see it outside your window .
it 's a huge challenge to understand .
`` the patterns that you see are there at all of the different scales , but you ca n't chop it into one little bit and say , `` oh , well let me just make a smaller climate . '' ''
we can look at that too , and the models are skillful .
we can look at the pollution from china .
so this is a history of the 20th century .
we know what happened over the 20th century .
we are inveterate storytellers .
and what narrative , what history , what identity , what moral code are we imparting to our young ?
cinema is arguably the 20th century 's most influential art form .
its artists told stories across national boundaries , in as many languages , genres and philosophies as one can imagine .
during the last decade we 've seen a vast integration of global media , now dominated by a culture of the hollywood blockbuster .
what was common to us all 40 years ago — the telling of stories between generations — is now rarified .
the irony is palpable ; technical access has never been greater , cultural access never weaker .
and so in 2006 we set up filmclub , an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions .
if we could raid the annals of 100 years of film , maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young .
in the first nine months we ran 25 clubs across the u.k. , with kids in age groups between five and 18 watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes .
by the time the pilot had finished , we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join .
i had seen the film on the occasion of my father 's 50th birthday .
technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema , find and pay for the print and the projectionist .
`` but for my father , the emotional and artistic importance of de sica 's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half-century with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends , `` '' in order , '' '' he said , `` '' to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation . '' '' in the last shot of `` '' miracle in milan , '' '' slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms . ''
sixty years after the film was made and 30 years after i first saw it , i see young faces tilt up in awe , their incredulity matching mine .
`` and the speed with which they associate it with `` '' slumdog millionaire '' '' or the favelas in rio speaks to the enduring nature . ''
it is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor .
it provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind .
`` `` '' pickpocket '' '' started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement . ''
`` `` '' to sir , with love '' '' ignited its teen audience . ''
by now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms — black and white , subtitled , documentary , non-narrative , fantasy — and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose .
and although the numbers were , and continue to be , extraordinary , what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life .
some of our kids started talking with their parents , others with their teachers , or with their friends .
and the stories they held provided a shared experience .
`` `` '' persepolis '' '' brought a daughter closer to her iranian mother , and `` '' jaws '' '' became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he 'd experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother , the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey . ''
was the tale told well ?
a tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world did n't think were interested .
in a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on table mountain and playing cops and robbers .
quite recently she told me that in 1948 , two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to israel without my grandparents .
when the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions , it was these teenagers that fed the crew .
he never mentioned that journey .
my mother 's mother left europe in a hurry without her husband , but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt .
my story started in england with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents .
`` i had `` '' anne frank , '' '' `` '' the great escape , '' '' `` shoah , '' `` triumph of the will . '' ''
but within the reels lie purpose and meaning .
`` consider `` '' citizen kane '' '' as valuable as jane austen . ''
each a piece of memorable art , each a brick in the wall of who we are .
and it 's okay if we remember tom hanks better than astronaut jim lovell or have ben kingsley 's face superimposed onto that of gandhi 's .
and though not real , eve harrington , howard beale , mildred pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human , and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as shakespeare is in illuminating the world of elizabethan england .
what we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior , confidence and academic achievement .
once-reluctant students now race to school , talk to their teachers , fight , not on the playground , but to choose next week 's film — young people who have found self-definition , ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed .
our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young .
they are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed .
we appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes , yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered .
if we want different values we have to tell a different story , a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person 's identity , that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity , and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group .
`` because when these people get home after a screening of `` '' rear window '' '' and raise their gaze to the building next door , they have the tools to wonder who , apart from them , is out there and what is their story . ''
thank you .

b.j . was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future .
he had a vision . when he got out , he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight , and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision .
he 'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars . ( laughter ) it was my first week in federal prison , and i was learning quickly that it was n't what you see on tv .
in fact , it was teeming with smart , ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the ceos who had wined and dined me six months earlier when i was a rising star in the missouri senate .
now , 95 percent of the guys that i was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside , but when they talked about what they did , they talked about it in a different jargon , but the business concepts that they talked about were n't unlike those that you 'd learn in a first year mba class at wharton : promotional incentives , you never charge a first-time user , focus-grouping new product launches , territorial expansion .
it 's a lot harder than you might think .
you 've got to pay for your soap , your deodorant , toothbrush , toothpaste , all of it .
and it 's hard for a couple of reasons .
i unloaded trucks . that was my full-time job , unloading trucks at a food warehouse , for $ 5.25 , not an hour , but per month .
there 's legal hustles .
you pay everything in stamps . those are the currency .
there 's sort of illegal hustles , like you run a barbershop out of your cell .
there 's pretty illegal hustles : you run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell .
and there 's very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there 's a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
you want a dirty magazine ?
well , it can be as much as 1,000 dollars .
so i hope that you 'll think about helping in some way .
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons , because if we do n't , they 're not going to learn any new skills that 's going to help them , and they 'll be right back .
cybercrime is out of control .
it 's everywhere .
here 's what would happen .
the dark web is where they spend their time .
you can check references .
this review did not sit well with the authors of bilal bot .
and that approach needs to be centered on the idea that we need to change the economics for the bad guys .
we need to effectively democratize threat intelligence data .
the bad guys are moving fast ; we 've got to move faster .
remember , they 're programmed right into their dna to keep secrets .
but there 's an even bigger benefit .
we inform the people they aim to hurt far sooner than they had ever anticipated .
we make cybercrime not pay .
we started publishing .
we all have the opportunity to stop it , and we already all know how .
thank you .
so what can we do with a conservation drone ?
( applause )
what about the second group ?
well , all but three were dead .
they 'd pecked the rest to death .
i 've started and run businesses because invention is a joy , and because working alongside brilliant , creative people is its own reward .
instead , they had three characteristics , the really successful teams .
this is measured by something called the reading the mind in the eyes test .
people do n't get stuck . they do n't waste energy down dead ends .
an example : arup is one of the world 's most successful engineering firms , and it was commissioned to build the equestrian center for the beijing olympics .
now , helpfulness sounds really anemic , but it 's absolutely core to successful teams , and it routinely outperforms individual intelligence .
now that sounds so obvious , and we think it 'll just happen normally , but it does n't .
and what motivates people are the bonds and loyalty and trust they develop between each other .
social capital is the reliance and interdependency that builds trust .
now , we are n't really used to talking about this , about talent , about creativity , in this way .
we 're used to talking about stars .
they were looking for what happened between the students , because that 's where the drama is .
it 's just , they do n't last very long .
now , rivalry has to be replaced by social capital .
now , we need to let people motivate each other .
but one team that rose to the challenge adopted three key principles .
everybody has a valid perspective .
second , we work to one standard only : the best imaginable .
there was a lot at stake then , and there 's a lot at stake now , and we wo n't solve our problems if we expect it to be solved by a few supermen or superwomen .
i spent my summers in a war zone , because my parents were afraid that if we did n't go back to palestine every single summer , we 'd grow up to be madonna .
i have cerebral palsy !
they only hired perfect people .
so i became a comic .
and we were live , right ?
what does she suffer from ?
i hope that together , we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life .
maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well .
i toured the world as a headliner on arabs gone wild .
and of course , all of you know what that word is .
so had the graduate heard the right one word , maybe he would have ended up onstage — oh , i do n't know — maybe with these two .
and this is not something new .
and that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens .
and we kind of take it for granted how we 've changed sex .
what 's happened with sex over time is — normally , sex equals baby , eventually .
so what are assisted reproductive technologies ?
and when you do in vitro fertilization , there 's very good reasons to do it .
sometimes you just ca n't conceive otherwise .
it means you can have twins born — oh , in 50 years ?
so this lifecode stuff turns out to be a superpower .
let 's have some risks .
and that scares a lot of people .
this is emma ott .
like curing deadly diseases — which , by the way , is completely unnatural .
this is unnatural selection .
and you 're doing that through unnatural selection .
it 's the same with a city , it 's the same with a suburb .
he 's otherwise known as the octopus , his nickname .
a non-random mutation is beer .
so we 've been engineering this stuff .
so this lifecode stuff .
so , principle number one : we have to take responsibility for this stuff .
most all of them went extinct except us .
some of us have some denisova in us .
and some in washington have a lot more of it .
we want to have darwin 's evolutionary system running .
gooseberry owned a patent for the creation and distribution of news releases via email .
take something already being done and patent it for an emerging technology — like phone calls on the internet or video listings for tv shows or radio but for cellphones , and so on .
and because these settlements are under a non-disclosure agreement , no one knows what the terms were .
now my company , fark , deals with news , ostensibly , and as a result we were not in violation of this patent .
wrong .
one of the major problems with patent law is that , in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll , the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant , which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they 're suing you on .
and this can take quite a while .
you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
that is your best case outcome when you get sued by a patent troll .
now i had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit , but one-by-one they settled out of the case , even though — and this is important — none of these companies infringed on this patent — not a one of them .
the reason they settled out is because it 's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit — clearly , two million dollars cheaper in some cases , and much worse if you actually lose .
six months into the lawsuit , we finally reached the discovery phase .
now perhaps it 's because no such screenshots actually existed , but suddenly gooseberry wanted to settle .
never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern l.a .
with no employees .
`` so would you mind giving us your best and final offer ? '' '' my response : `` how about nothing ? ! '' ''
( applause ) we did n't have high hopes for that outcome .
now , as mentioned before , one of the reasons i can talk to you about this is because there 's no non-disclosure agreement on this case .
well during the settlement process , when we received our copy , i struck it .
`` my attorney said , `` '' nah , no chance of that working . '' '' it came back signed . ''
patents are very difficult to overturn .
infringement is a lot easier to disprove .
now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they 're able to recover in settlements .
if it becomes clear to them that they can not recover any money , they become less interested in pursuing the case .
finally , make sure that you can tell them that you will make this process as annoying and as painful and as difficult as possible for them .
now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way .
it turns out , because they 're paid on contingency , it works really , really well in reverse .
do n't forget that .
they plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits .
now this is the point in the talk where i 'm supposed to come up with some kind of a solution for the patent system .
and these goals are n't necessarily diametrically opposed , but they are at odds .
and as a result , patent trolls can kind of live in the space in between .
however , i did have this idea , and it was kind of good .
my solution : award me this patent and i will troll them out of existence .
thank you .
( applause )
this is a painting from the 16th century from lucas cranach the elder .
it shows the famous fountain of youth .
if you drink its water or you bathe in it , you will get health and youth .
every culture , every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth .
there are people like alexander the great or ponce de león , the explorer , who spent much of their life chasing the fountain of youth .
they did n't find it .
what if there was something to this fountain of youth ?
it started with experiments that showed , in a recent number of studies about growing , that animals — old mice — that share a blood supply with young mice can get rejuvenated .
so , what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment in this model called parabiosis , shows a younger brain — and a brain that functions better .
we can do cognitive tests , we can do imaging — all kinds of sophisticated testing .
this is what neuropathologists do , for example .
so , how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism .
so if the body ages or gets sick , does that affect the brain ?
and what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood .
so our body lives in a very different environment as we get older , when it comes to these factors .
so , how many years they lived .
but what 's really exciting are the outliers , as they so often are in life .
but more importantly : is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age-related disease and will have a long life — will live to 100 or more ?
is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age-related disease ?
so what i 've shown you so far is simply correlational , right ?
so what i 'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue .
`` so , parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together , and that leads then to a shared blood system , where we can now ask , `` '' how does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood ? '' '' and for this purpose , we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20-year-old people , and old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years . ''
what we found is quite remarkable .
as mice get older , like us humans , they have memory problems .
and to do this , we used a test . it 's called a barnes maze .
this is a big table that has lots of holes in it , and there are guide marks around it , and there 's a bright light , as on this stage here .
so by all means , this old mouse seems to be rejuvenated — it functions more like a younger mouse .
and it also suggests that there is something not only in young mouse plasma , but in young human plasma that has the capacity to help this old brain .
it can be rejuvenated .
old human blood , i did n't show you , does not have this effect ; it does not make the mice younger .
we test them cognitively , and we ask their caregivers for daily activities of living .
what we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment .
well , at least , here at cern .
but for me , the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise .
in the eye of a theoretical physicist , the higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass , but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution .
too many questions are left unanswered .
for this reason , the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the higgs boson could not be the full story .
we were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the higgs boson .
in 2015 , the lhc will almost double the energy of the colliding protons , and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world , and we will certainly learn much more .
but for the moment , since we have found no evidence for new phenomena , let us suppose that the particles that we know today , including the higgs boson , are the only elementary particles in nature , even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far .
we will find a surprising and intriguing result about our universe , and to explain my point , let me first tell you what the higgs is about , and to do so , we have to go back to one tenth of a billionth of a second after the big bang .
and according to the higgs theory , at that instant , a dramatic event took place in the universe .
it was something very similar to the phase transition that occurs when water turns into ice below zero degrees .
during this phase transition , empty space became filled with a substance that we now call higgs field .
and this substance may seem invisible to us , but it has a physical reality .
it surrounds us all the time , just like the air we breathe in this room .
and some elementary particles interact with this substance , gaining energy in the process .
and this intrinsic energy is what we call the mass of a particle , and by discovering the higgs boson , the lhc has conclusively proved that this substance is real , because it is the stuff the higgs bosons are made of .
and this , in a nutshell , is the essence of the higgs story .
but this story is far more interesting than that .
by studying the higgs theory , theoretical physicists discovered , not through an experiment but with the power of mathematics , that the higgs field does not necessarily exist only in the form that we observe today .
just like matter can exist as liquid or solid , so the higgs field , the substance that fills all space-time , could exist in two states .
besides the known higgs state , there could be a second state in which the higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today , and the mere existence of another state of the higgs field poses a potential problem .
this is because , according to the laws of quantum mechanics , it is possible to have transitions between two states , even in the presence of an energy barrier separating the two states , and the phenomenon is called , quite appropriately , quantum tunneling .
you would have to wait a really long time before it happens , but believe me , quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon , and it has been observed in many systems .
but let 's go back to the higgs field .
if the ultra-dense higgs state existed , then , because of quantum tunneling , a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time , and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water .
bubbles of vapor form inside the water , then they expand , turning liquid into gas .
if the higgs field were only a few times more intense , we would see atoms shrinking , neutrons decaying inside atomic nuclei , nuclei disintegrating , and hydrogen would be the only possible chemical element in the universe .
and the higgs field , in the ultra-dense higgs state , is not just a few times more intense than today , but billions of times , and if space-time were filled by this higgs state , all atomic matter would collapse .
so , i wonder , is it possible that in the future , the higgs field will undergo a phase transition and , through quantum tunneling , will be transformed into this nasty , ultra-dense state ?
and the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the higgs boson mass .
and experiments at the lhc found that the mass of the higgs boson is about 126 gev .
so armed with this information from the lhc , together with some colleagues here at cern , we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra-dense higgs state , and we found a very intriguing result .
our calculations showed that the measured value of the higgs boson mass is very special .
it has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation .
the higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse .
so according to these calculations , we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff .
so is this how humanity is going to disappear ?
( laughter ) even so , we will be long gone by then .
so it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the higgs field collapse .
why is it just right to keep the universe at the edge of a phase transition ?
`` we think that this these `` '' why '' '' questions can give us clues about the fundamental principles of nature . ''
it has been speculated that our universe is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse made out of a multitude of bubbles , and each bubble is a different universe with different fundamental constants and different physical laws .
then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse .
it would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach .
and the reason is simple : because wind builds up the sand , gravity makes it fall .
as a result , the vast majority of sand dunes have slope angles around the critical value , near to collapse .
and something similar could happen for the higgs boson mass in the multiverse .
in the majority of bubble universes , the higgs mass could be around the critical value , near to a cosmic collapse of the higgs field , because of two competing effects , just as in the case of sand .
my story does not have an end , because we still do n't know the end of the story .
this is science in progress , and to solve the mystery , we need more data , and hopefully , the lhc will soon add new clues to this story .
just one number , the higgs boson mass , and yet , out of this number we learn so much .
i started from a hypothesis , that the known particles are all there is in the universe , even beyond the domain explored so far .
but i do n't know if my hypothesis is right .
but whichever it turns out to be , there is one thing i 'm sure of : the journey will be full of surprises .
`` how do you feel ? '' '' these sound kind of meaningless , right ? and , in some ways , they are . ''
they have no semantic meaning .
they have something else .
i get all kinds of stories .
what i found was that something really beautiful was going on .
these were really profound experiences .
they were unexpected pleasures .
so this is absurd , right ?
we had this little bond .
for a minute , i felt like my existence as a person had been noticed , and i was worth saving .
but most strangers are n't dangerous .
`` so instead of using our perceptions and making choices , we rely on this category of `` '' stranger . '' '' i have a four-year-old . ''
we could make a space for change .
would n't we want to open doors for them instead ?
and i tend to think of it like my shadow .
so , our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity , but preparing them to meet it well .
we are effectively grading someone 's worth to our community .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility — or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous — we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
being a mathematician , he set out to understand why .
i read the obituaries almost every day .
were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured — even if you are n't around to enjoy it ?
2,000 editorial , non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016 .
well , first we looked at words .
this here is an obituary headline .
just looking at these is fascinating .
here are a few famous ones , people who died in the last two years .
[ titan of boxing and the 20th century ] oh , yes .
[ muhammad ali ] [ groundbreaking architect ] zaha hadid .
over 40 percent .
you have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful .
of course , it varies by profession .
so what if we analyze these two groups separately — the famous and the non-famous ?
two things leap out at me .
`` first : `` john . '' ''
`` and second : `` help . '' ''
we uncovered , many lessons from lives well-led , and what those people immortalized in print could teach us .
the exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life , and even more fascinating was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries featured people famous and non-famous , who did seemingly extraordinary things .
thank you .
so does a site like this have rules ?
i did n't instruct them to do it ; they just decided that that 's what they wanted .
and i ended up on top .
`` and `` '' marble cake '' '' is significant because it is the channel that this group called anonymous organized . ''
cp : there are , certainly .
ca : but you still live at home , right ?
the content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
cp : yeah . they still did n't know what to think of that though .
so what i want to try to do is tell a quick story about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it .
but to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is .
the 404 page is that .
it 's that broken experience on the web .
it 's effectively the default page when you ask a website for something and it ca n't find it .
and it serves you the 404 page .
it 's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it .
because it 's the feeling of a broken relationship .
it 's from a family of errors actually — a whole set of relationship errors , which , when i started digging into them , it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples counselor .
you sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey .
( laughter ) yes .
but these things are everywhere .
they 're on sites big , they 're on sites small .
this is a global experience .
a 404 page is not what you 're looking for .
trying to think about how a 404 felt , and it would be like if you went to starbucks and there 's the guy behind the counter and you 're over there and there 's no skim milk .
`` and you say , `` '' hey , could you bring the skim milk ? '' '' and they walk out from behind the counter and they 've got no pants on . ''
`` and you 're like , `` '' oh , i did n't want to see that . '' '' that 's the 404 feeling . ''
( laughter ) i mean , i 've heard about that .
so where this comes into play and why this is important is i head up a technology incubator , and we had eight startups sitting around there .
and those startups are focused on what they are , not what they 're not , until one day athletepath , which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes , found this video .
( video ) guy : joey !
renny gleeson : you just ... no , he 's not okay .
( laughter ) ( applause ) so this turned into a contest .
dailypath that offers inspiration put inspiration on their 404 page .
stayhound , which helps you find pet sitters through your social network , commiserated with your pet .
at 4:04 the next day , we gave out $ 404 in cash .
and what they learned was that those little things , done right , actually matter , and that well-designed moments can build brands .
so you take a look out in the real world , and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself .
you can type in an url and put in a 404 and these will pop .
this is one that commiserates with you .
so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be .
because back to the whole relationship issue , what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you 're not , or it can remind me of why i should love you .
( applause )
the change was silent , imperceptible , unless you knew exactly what to look for .
instantaneously , every civilian gps receiver around the globe went from errors the size of a football field to errors the size of a small room .
it 's hard to overstate the effect that this change in accuracy has had on us .
this level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation .
in fact , many of you navigated here today with the help of your tomtom or your smartphone .
paper maps are becoming obsolete .
but we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy .
but you and i and other innovators , we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy .
the holy grail , of course , is the gps dot .
`` do you remember the movie `` '' the da vinci code ? '' '' here 's professor langdon examining a gps dot , which his accomplice tells him is a tracking device accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe , but we know that in the world of nonfiction , the gps dot is impossible , right ? ''
for one thing , gps does n't work indoors , and for another , they do n't make devices quite this small , especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network .
there 's been a strong trend toward miniaturization , better sensitivity , so much so that , a few years ago , a gps tracking device looked like this clunky box to the left of the keys .
compare that with the device released just months ago that 's now packaged into something the size of a key fob , and if you take a look at the state of the art for a complete gps receiver , which is only a centimeter on a side and more sensitive than ever , you realize that the gps dot will soon move from fiction to nonfiction .
it 's not just that you 'll never lose your wallet or your keys anymore , or your child when you 're at disneyland .
i should be able to ask my house where my shoes are .
( laughter ) those of you who have made the switch to gmail , remember how refreshing it was to go from organizing all of your email to simply searching it .
the gps dot will do the same for our possessions .
now , of course , there is a flip side to the gps dot .
i was in my office some months back and got a telephone call .
the woman on the other end of the line , we 'll call her carol , was panicked .
apparently , an ex-boyfriend of carol 's from california had found her in texas and was following her around .
well , so did i .
every time her ex-boyfriend would show up , at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations , he was carrying an open laptop , and over time carol realized that he had planted a gps tracking device on her car , so she was calling me for help to disable it .
`` `` '' well , you should go to a good mechanic and have him look at your car , '' '' i said . ''
`` `` '' they 're not sure this rises to the level of harassment , and they 're not set up technically to find the device . '' '' `` okay , what about the fbi ? '' ''
`` `` i 've talked to them too , and same story . '' ''
so , there we were .
carol is n't the first , and certainly wo n't be the last , to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment , worrisome situation caused by gps tracking .
in fact , as i looked into her case , i discovered to my surprise that it 's not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else 's car .
`` it 's an open-source gps jammer , developed by limor fried , a graduate student at mit , and limor calls it `` a tool for reclaiming our personal space . '' ''
with a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you within which gps signals ca n't reside .
they get drowned out by the bubble .
and limor designed this , in part , because , like carol , she felt threatened by gps tracking .
chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical devices on the internet .
so you might be thinking , the wave bubble sounds great .
i should have one . might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car .
but you should be aware that its use is very much illegal in the united states .
imagine , for example , you 're the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog and some passenger in the back turns on a wave bubble .
all of a sudden your gps readout goes blank , and now it 's just you and the fog and whatever you can pull off the radar system if you remember how to work it .
they — in fact , they do n't update or upkeep lighthouses anymore , and loran , the only backup to gps , was discontinued last year .
we 're almost blindly reliant on it .
`` some call it `` '' the invisible utility . '' '' so , turning on a wave bubble might not just cause inconvenience . ''
but as it turns out , for purposes of protecting your privacy at the expense of general gps reliability , there 's something even more potent and more subversive than a wave bubble , and that is a gps spoofer .
the idea behind the gps spoofer is simple .
instead of jamming the gps signals , you fake them .
so let me show you how this works .
but if you send in a fake gps signal , another peak pops up , and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned , the tracking points ca n't tell the difference , and they get hijacked by the stronger counterfeit signal , with the authentic peak getting forced off .
so is this really possible ?
can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a gps receiver just like that , with a spoofer ?
well , the short answer is yes .
they have no encryption . they have no authentication .
even so , up until very recently , nobody worried about gps spoofers .
but i , and a friend of mine from graduate school , we did n't see it that way .
we knew it was n't going to be so hard , and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against gps spoofing .
now , the dr. frankenstein moment , when the spoofer finally came alive and i glimpsed its awful potential , came late one night when i tested the spoofer against my iphone .
let me show you some actual footage from that very first experiment .
it was a sense , almost , of betrayal , when this little blue dot started at my house , and went running off toward the north leaving me behind . i was n't moving .
what i then saw in this little moving blue dot was the potential for chaos .
i saw the gps-derived timing of the new york stock exchange being manipulated by hackers .
you can scarcely imagine the kind of havoc you could cause if you knew what you were doing with a gps spoofer .
there is , though , one redeeming feature of the gps spoofer .
it 's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of gps dots .
i hold out hope that we 'll be able to reconcile this conflict with some sort of , some yet uninvented technology .
maybe you 'll have a whole bag full of them .
you 'll never lose track of your things again .
the gps dot will fundamentally reorder your life .
so , as usual , what we see just beyond the horizon is full of promise and peril .
`` what i 'm most interested in as a scientist is the `` '' how '' '' of science . ''
because science is knowledge in process .
this led us to learn something new .
this is how science moves forward . this is how science learns .
something hit the side of my face , and i did n't know what it was .
what 's this about ?
bg : well , my graph has numbers on it .
what about failure , though ?
how is that going ?
it tries to balance out , and that 's just .
writing books is my profession but it 's more than that , of course .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and i always have been .
so jesus , what a thought !
it just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape .
this is hard .
`` and `` '' olé ! '' '' to you , nonetheless . ''
and yeah , it 's the sort of thing you produce when you 're doodling on the phone .
it 's more economical and also more efficient .
i 'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway .
`` it 's called `` '' untitled '' '' and i think that 's appropriate . ''
so , in the tidied-up version we have a sort of keith haring spare parts shop .
( laughter ) but i think it could still benefit from more discipline .
it goes back to a time when i was very often staying in hotels .
like books , clothes , toothbrush , etc . and it was great .
this is the village square by pieter bruegel .
and i 'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist .
yeah , i think , after you have seen that i have to leave anyway .
this is my niece , stella .
it is absolutely gorgeous .
when is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we look ?
this is faye . faye is 13 and she lives in denver .
and like any teenager , she just wants to be liked and to fit in .
she 's getting ready for the week ahead at school .
because of the difference between what her mom tells her and what her friends at school , or her peers at school are telling her , she does n't know who to believe .
well , so far , faye has received over 13,000 comments .
never before have we been so connected , so continuously , so instantaneously , so young .
and as one mom told me , it 's like there 's a party in their bedroom every night .
and the social pressures that go along with that are relentless .
there 's no separation between online and offline life .
well , you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds of girls today .
well , surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy , well balanced individuals .
these are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contributors to society and to the workforce .
low body confidence is undermining academic achievement .
but it 's also damaging health .
and we do n't grow out of it .
if we could overcome this , what that opportunity looks like .
it 's not enough by itself .
the bad news is that most of them do n't work .
an education is critical , but tackling this problem is going to require each and everyone of us to step up and be better role models for the women and girls in our own lives .
but let 's show our kids the truth .
let 's each and every one of us change the way we talk and compare ourselves to other people .
let me introduce to you rezero .
the main characteristics of such a system is that there 's one sole contact point to the ground .
this means that the robot is inherently unstable .
this happens 160 times per second , and if anything fails in this process , rezero would immediately fall to the ground .
now to move and to balance , rezero needs to turn the ball .
the ball is driven by three special wheels that allow rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time .
it 's indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very [ dynamically ] .
in the next mode , rezero is passive , and we can move him around .
with almost no force i can control his position and his velocity .
i can also make him spin .
in the next mode , we can get rezero to follow a person .
this works with a laser sensor that 's mounted on top of rezero .
with the same method , we can also get him to circle a person .
we call this the orbiting mode .
all right , thank you , thomas .
( applause ) now , what 's the use of this technology ?
for now , it 's an experiment , but let me show you some possible future applications .
with a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way .
due to the ballbot system , it has a very small footprint and it 's also easy to move around .
and these are more practical applications .
but there 's also a certain beauty within this technology .
( music ) ( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) thank you .
and i focus on that , on the present moment .
and they were n't savanna species .
i mean , it 's a terrible thing to happen .
i mean , why do n't we talk about , well , there 's chromosomes , and there 's genes .
he knew all about that kind of science .
and he called it hypothesis-free science .
and he despised it from the bottom of his heart .
`` i suggested it and people said , `` '' no no no . ''
daniel dennett , he 's come over .
i do n't think there is a third option .
move on ... in fact ... concern ...
this meant making trade-offs .
and the tubing coming out of my chest was a nightmare for costume designers .
he said it would kill me .
what i want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans .
but nothing , of course , in nature is totally perfect , so sometimes an error is made and a wrong letter is built in .
and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room , for example .
approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee .
and if you 're then interested in the history of a piece of dna , or the whole genome , you can reconstruct the history of the dna with those differences you observe .
and generally we depict our ideas about this history in the form of trees like this .
in this case , it 's very simple .
the two human dna sequences go back to a common ancestor quite recently .
farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees .
and they are around three billion such letters long .
and if you look outside africa , you actually find less genetic variation .
yet the people inside africa have more genetic variation .
moreover , almost all these genetic variants we see outside africa have closely related dna sequences that you find inside africa .
but if you look in africa , there is a component of the genetic variation that has no close relatives outside .
so a model to explain this is that a part of the african variation , but not all of it , [ has ] gone out and colonized the rest of the world .
so what i often like to say is that , from a genomic perspective , we are all africans .
we either live inside africa today , or in quite recent exile .
but does this then mean , as many people tend to think , that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people — on different continents , for example ?
well we can begin to ask those questions also .
there is , for example , a project that 's underway to sequence a thousand individuals — their genomes — from different parts of the world .
and we can begin to say how much variance do we find , how many letters that vary in at least one of those individual sequences .
but we can then ask : are there any absolute differences between africans and non-africans ?
this may be surprising .
so we can relax the criterion a bit and say : how many positions do we find where 95 percent of people in africa have one variant , 95 percent another variant , and the number of that is 12 .
this may be surprising , because we can , of course , look at these people and quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from .
so what this means now is that those traits we then look at and so readily see — facial features , skin color , hair structure — are not determined by single genes with big effects , but are determined by many different genetic variants that seem to vary in frequency between different parts of the world .
there is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that i think is worthwhile to consider , and that is that , in a very literal sense , they 're really on the surface of our bodies .
they are what we just said — facial features , hair structure , skin color .
but so those are all parts of our bodies where we very directly interact with our environment , in a direct confrontation , if you like .
it 's easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them .
but if we look on other parts of our bodies where we do n't directly interact with the environment — our kidneys , our livers , our hearts — there is no way to say , by just looking at these organs , where in the world they would come from .
so there 's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common origin in africa , and that is that when those humans emerged around 100,000 years ago or so , they were not alone on the planet .
there were other forms of humans around , most famously perhaps , neanderthals — these robust forms of humans , compared to the left here with a modern human skeleton on the right — that existed in western asia and europe since several hundreds of thousands of years .
so an interesting question is , what happened when we met ?
so this involves a lot of technical issues in how you extract the dna , how you convert it to a form you can sequence .
and you can begin to compare it to the genomes of people who live today .
and the way to ask that question is to look at the neanderthal that comes from southern europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today .
so we then look to do this with pairs of individuals , starting with two africans , looking at the two african genomes , finding places where they differ from each other , and in each case ask : what is a neanderthal like ?
does it match one african or the other african ?
they should be equal , have no reason to be closer to one african than another african .
but this is different if we now look at the european individual and an african .
then , significantly more often , does a neanderthal match the european rather than the african .
so the model we 've proposed to explain this is that when modern humans came out of africa sometime after 100,000 years ago , they met neanderthals .
so that today , the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals .
so having now a neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the dna , we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world .
and the first place we 've done that is in southern siberia in the altai mountains at a place called denisova , a cave site in this mountain here , where archeologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone — this is a copy of it — that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human .
and it was well enough preserved so we could determine the dna from this individual , even to a greater extent than for the neanderthals actually , and start relating it to the neanderthal genome and to people today .
and further back , 800,000 years ago is there a common origin with present day humans .
so this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with neanderthals , but far back and then have a long independent history .
if we ask that question , and compare the denisovan genome to people around the world , we surprisingly find no evidence of denisovan dna in any people living even close to siberia today .
so this presumably means that these denisovans had been more widespread in the past , since we do n't think that the ancestors of melanesians were ever in siberia .
we do n't know quite where the borders between these people were , but we know that in southern siberia , there were both neanderthals and denisovans at least at some time in the past .
then modern humans emerged somewhere in africa , came out of africa , presumably in the middle east .
does this then mean that there is after all some absolute difference between people outside africa and inside africa in that people outside africa have this old component in their genome from these extinct forms of humans , whereas africans do not ?
they spread across africa also , of course , and there were older , earlier forms of humans there .
we learn perhaps many things , but one thing that i find sort of important to mention is that i think the lesson is that we have always mixed .
thank you for your attention .
as a boy , i loved cars .
like this .
and then i decided i 'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year .
now i have n't succeeded , so this is just a progress report , but i 'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars .
i saw the concept first in the darpa grand challenges where the u.s. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert .
so we decided at stanford to build a different self-driving car .
and the unimaginable happened : it became the first car to ever return from a darpa grand challenge , winning stanford 2 million dollars .
we 've driven 140,000 miles .
our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving .
we 've encountered joggers , busy highways , toll booths , and this is without a person in the loop ; the car just drives itself .
mountain roads , day and night , and even crooked lombard street in san francisco .
( laughter ) sometimes our cars get so crazy , they even do little stunts .
( video ) man : oh , my god .
what ?
second man : it 's driving itself .
sebastian thrun : now i ca n't get my friend harold back to life , but i can do something for all the people who died .
do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people ?
and do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error , and can therefore be prevented by machines ?
do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we did n't rely on human precision on staying in the lane — improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes , and do away with all traffic jams on highways ?
this is four billion hours wasted in this country alone .
now i think there 's a vision here , a new technology , and i 'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars .
( applause )
over the last 13 years — one , three , 13 years — i 've been part of an exceptional team at insightec in israel and partners around the world for taking this idea , this concept , noninvasive surgery , from the research lab to routine clinical use .
and this is what i 'll tell you about .
( laughter ) so this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies .
one is the focused ultrasound , and the other one is the vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging .
so let 's first talk about focused ultrasound .
and i hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom .
it is made out of silicon .
it is transparent , made just for you .
i 'll take you now to the acoustic lab .
on the right-hand side , you see an ultrasonic transducer .
so the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom .
okay , when you hear the click , this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom .
it 's just a lesion formed inside .
we can do it without harming any tissue .
so this is , i think , the first kosher hippocratic surgical system .
and you know also about lithotripsy — breaking kidney stones .
and i am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing , physically focusing .
so this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all .
when i was born , this idea was already conceived by pioneers such as the fry brothers and lars leksell , who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife .
he failed , so he then invented the gammaknife .
and it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed .
so this is how it looks , you know , the operating room of the future today .
this is an mr suite with a focused ultrasound system .
and i will give you several examples .
so the first one is in the brain .
so i 'd like you to meet john .
john is a retired professor of history from virginia .
and many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain .
`` `` '' on june 20th , '' '' if you can read it , `` 2011 . '' ''
and the physician will then take a regular mr scan .
and the objective of that ?
i do n't have a pointer here , but you see the green , sort of rectangle or trapezoid ?
`` so once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on , he selects basically a point — you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is — and he presses this blue button called `` '' sonicate . '' '' we call this instance of injecting the energy , we call it sonication . ''
you see the transducer , the light blue .
there 's water in between the skull and the transducer .
and it does this burst of energy .
it elevates the temperature .
and one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the mr is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively .
this is really a unique capability of the mr .
but here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .
this does n't cause any damage .
and you see the temperature rises to like 55 to 60 degrees c .
this is the outcome from a patient perspective — same day after the treatment .
this is an immediate relief .
( applause ) thank you .
and this is a quote from john after he wrote it .
i mean , one of the messages i like to carry over is , what about defending quality of life ?
and john today is fully independent .
he returned to a normal life routine .
okay , so you can see here the spot .
it 's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain .
he suffers from no neurodeficit .
there 's no recovery needed , no nothing .
let 's move now to a more painful subject .
pain is something that can make your life miserable .
and people are suffering from all kinds of pain like neuropathic pain , lower-back pain and cancer pain from bone metastases , when the metastases get to your bones , sometimes they are very painful .
he 's a 78 year-old farmer who suffered from — how should i say it ? — it 's called pain in the butt .
he had metastases in his right buttock , and he could n't sit even with medication .
and again , he volunteered to a pivotal study that we ran worldwide , also in the u.s .
and his wife actually took him .
he had to sit on a cushion , stand still , not move , because it was very painful .
so again , this is an immediate relief .
and you have to understand what those people feel and what their family experiences when it happens .
he rides his tractor .
he rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly .
what can be done there ?
so i have good news and bad news .
is very painful .
i do n't see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen .
they were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .
and we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .
but i have a message for the men here .
the challenge there with a breathing and awake patient — and in all our treatments , the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician — is you have to teach the mr some tricks how to do it in real time .
and this is , in 2004 , the fda has approved mr-guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids .
all those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods , abdominal pressure , back pain , frequent urination .
and sometimes , they can not even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid .
this is frances .
she was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid .
so she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in 2008 .
and in 2010 , she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby .
( applause ) so in conclusion , i 'd like to leave you with actually four messages .
and the other thing i would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient on the table [ who ] is awake and can even monitor the treatment .
in all our treatments , the patient holds a stop sonication button .
and with that note , i would like to thank you for listening .
did you know this was happening ?
might fail , kid . do n't make a lot of money at that , kid .
we have focused on the problems .
i 'm not at all a cook .
and that is bread — something which is as simple as our basic , most fundamental human staple .
bread is not only standard in the western diet .
so i 'm going to bake bread for you .
i have two loaves of bread here .
one is a supermarket standard : white bread , pre-packaged , which i 'm told is called a wonderbread .
and this is more or less , a whole-meal , handmade , small-bakery loaf of bread .
here we go . i want to see a show of hands .
who prefers the whole-meal bread ?
okay let me do this differently . is anybody preferring the wonderbread at all ?
okay , now the question is really , why is this so ?
and life is really , too .
why do we have this image ?
well i think it has a lot to do with our history .
in the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved , most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists or they were closely related to food production .
and we have this mythical image of how life was in rural areas in the past .
art has helped us to maintain that kind of image .
it was a mythical past .
but we have , somehow , in the course of the last few centuries , or even decades , started to cultivate an image of a mythical , rural agricultural past .
it was only 200 years ago that we had the advent of the industrial revolution .
and while i 'm starting to make some bread for you here , it 's very important to understand what that revolution did to us .
and it actually drove up our yields .
and even sort of horrible things , like picking beans by hand , can now be done automatically .
of course we also , particularly in the last decade , managed to envelop the world in a dense chain of supermarkets , in a chain of global trade .
excuse my hands but this is how it is .
and do n't despise the white bread because it really , i think , symbolizes the fact that bread and food have become plentiful and affordable to all .
this tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world .
well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics .
with the advent of the industrial revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades , since the 1960s , food availability , per head , in this world , has increased by 25 percent .
that means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history .
and that is the result , directly , of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production .
what happened to our bread in the meantime ?
and it frees us all up to do other things — to sit at ted meetings and not to worry about our food .
never before has the responsibility to feed the world been in the hands of so few people .
and never before have so many people been oblivious of that fact .
it is the basic , most fundamental food that we 've had in the last ten thousand years .
but this is now this strange concoction of high calories .
bread has migrated to tropical countries , where the middle classes now eat french rolls and hamburgers and where the commuters find bread much more handy to use than rice or cassava .
so bread has become from a main staple , a source of calories associated with obesity and also a source of modernity , of modern life .
so this is the story of bread as we know it now .
the costs have been tremendous — water pollution , all the things you know about , destruction of our habitats .
and this is where i have to query all of you .
how many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals ?
how many of you actually can make a bread in this way , without starting with a bread machine or just some kind of packaged flavor ?
we have become very removed from what our bread really is , which , again , evolutionarily speaking , is very strange .
in fact not many of you know that our bread , of course , was not a european invention .
the tiny spike on the left to the center is actually the forefather of wheat .
this is where it all comes from , and where these farmers who actually , ten thousand years ago , put us on the road of bread .
`` the counter-movement says , `` '' let 's go back to this . ''
let 's go back to traditional farming .
do n't we all agree ? i certainly agree .
i would love to go back to tuscany to this kind of traditional setting , gastronomy , good food .
but this is a fallacy .
what they want are implements to increase their production : something to fertilize the soil , something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market .
we can not just think that small-scale is the solution to the world food problem .
it 's a luxury solution for us who can afford it , if you want to afford it .
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this .
if we say just small-scale production , as is the tendency here , to go back to local food means that a poor man like hans rosling can not even eat oranges anymore because in scandinavia we do n't have oranges .
and we do not want to relegate the urban poor to starvation .
so we must find other solutions .
one of our problems is that world food production needs to increase very rapidly — doubling by about 2030 .
and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what drives the prices of cereals .
that need for animal protein is going to continue .
we can discuss alternatives in another talk , perhaps one day , but this is our driving force .
yes . but we need mechanization .
and i 'm making a real plea here .
you can not ask people to work under these conditions .
that 's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years .
what i want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there but go to a kind of regional scale — not just in terms of the scale of the fields , but in terms of the entire food network .
so we need to think differently about agriculture science .
we have much cleverer irrigation .
we do not need to spill the water if we do n't want to .
it has different functions .
there are different ways in which we must use it — for residential , for nature , for agriculture purposes .
and we also need to re-examine livestock .
go regional and go to urban food systems .
there are all kinds of ways we can do it .
but we can do a lot more .
and the main thing that i would really ask all of you as you go back to your countries , or as you stay here : ask your government for an integrated food policy .
everything is linked together .
there is all kinds of things we can do .
you must go back and think about your own food chain .
talk to farmers . when was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer ?
talk to people in restaurants .
understand that you are part of this enormous chain of events .
and above all , to me , food is about respect .
and the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have , to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution , is really not morally justified .
we need to help to lift them out of poverty .
and never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap .
and i think there is nobody else who has expressed better , to me , the idea that food , in the end , in our own tradition , is something holy .
it 's not about nutrients and calories .
`` he did not speak about rice , in india . he said , `` '' to those who have to go without two meals a day , god can only appear as bread . '' '' and so as i 'm finishing my bread here — and i 've been baking it , and i 'll try not to burn my hands . ''
let me share some of the food with you .
take some of my bread .
and as you eat it , and as you try it — please come and stand up .
have some of it .
everything makes us so privileged , that we can eat this food , that we do n't struggle every day .
and that , i think , evolutionarily-speaking is unique .
we 've never had that before .
so enjoy your bread .

the building has become part of everyday life in beijing .
they 're open , permeable ; they 're interconnected .
this is , in fact , the 13th floor of one of these terraces .
in the 19th century , prince albert had created albertopolis .
and boris johnson thought of creating olympicopolis .
the idea was to bring together some of britain 's greatest institutions , some international ones , and to create a new system of synergies .
and he built exhibition road , a linear sequence of those institutions .
but of course , today 's society has moved on from there .
here 's a scale comparison to the centre pompidou in paris .
any tool can be used to build or to destroy .
so now we indeed are facing many challenges in our times .
our own mind can be our best friend or our worst enemy .
we are now the major agent of impact on our earth .
but this depends on choosing a voluntary simplicity , growing qualitatively , not quantitatively .
it is simply having more consideration for others .
you will not play at the casino with the resources that people have entrusted you with .
and if you have more consideration for others , you are not going to ransack that planet that we have and at the current rate , we do n't have three planets to continue that way .
so some philosophers thought we were irredeemably selfish .
many philosophers , like hobbes , have said so .
but not everyone looks like a rascal .
but this guy does n't seem too bad .
so now , we love cooperation .
now do we have to wait for an altruistic gene to be in the human race ?
fortunately , there is the evolution of culture .
we have 25,000 kids in school , four percent overhead .
but on the more global level , what can we do ?
we need three things .
and we need to dare altruism .
it was grey and black , and he thought it looked cheap .
this was a person that nobody seemed to be missing .
so it became a cold case .
he was born in the syrian capital of damascus in 1991 .
reality was not that easy .
what happens in vegas ends up on youtube . ( laughter ) reputations are volatile . loyalties are fickle .
i 'm a marketer , and as a marketer , i know that i 've never really been in control .
hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now , 24/7 .
they can listen and join the conversation .
in fact , they have more control over the loss of control than ever before .
`` the danish chocolate company anthon berg opened a so-called `` '' generous store '' '' in copenhagen . ''
the sense of co-ownership , the free publicity , the added value , all helped drive sales .
research has shown that giving employees more control over their work makes them happier and more productive .
the brazilian company semco group famously lets employees set their own work schedules and even their salaries .
hulu and netflix , among other companies , have open vacation policies .
nextpedition turns the trip into a game , with surprising twists and turns along the way .
it does not tell the traveler where she 's going until the very last minute , and information is provided just in time . similarly , dutch airline klm launched a surprise campaign , seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination .
is there anything companies can do to make their employees feel less pressed for time ? yes .
force them to help others .
by applying a strict process , we give them less control , less choice , but we enable more and richer social interactions .
that should make them more humble , more vulnerable and more human .
`` or as the ballet dancer alonzo king said , `` what 's interesting about you is you . '' ''
companies can give their employees and customers more control or less . they can worry about how much openness is good for them , and what needs to stay closed .
now , that 's the good news .
i want to tell you about another disorder .
this one is a disorder which is quite rare .
let me tell you another thing we could do .
we are in a remarkable moment here .
thank you all very much .
`` i called my best friend , claire , and said , `` '' i know this is going to sound crazy , but , um ... ''
so that night , i called the gas company .
so that haunting story has led me to my job .
that 's not true .
so they set up a test with him , and this is the way it always works .
now , on the other hand , maybe one time it 'll turn out to be true .
i still get excited at ghost stories every single time .
and also , please have a carbon monoxide detector in your home .
thank you .
jonathan haidt : yeah .
what on earth is going on , and how did we get here ?
that brought us out of the jungle and out of small groups , but it means that we have eternal conflict .
ca : the size of that tribe can shrink or expand .
and some people believed that process could continue indefinitely .
you see this all over europe as well .
and britain is divided 52-48 on that point .
and america is divided on that point , too .
`` ca : and so , those of us who grew up with the beatles and that sort of hippie philosophy of dreaming of a more connected world — it felt so idealistic and `` '' how could anyone think badly about that ? '' '' and what you 're saying is that , actually , millions of people today feel that that is n't just silly ; it 's actually dangerous and wrong , and they 're scared of it . ''
jh : i think the big issue , especially in europe but also here , is the issue of immigration .
once something becomes politicized , once it becomes something that the left loves and the right — then even the social scientists ca n't think straight about it .
it clearly creates more innovation .
but i think this is the thing , especially in europe and for us , too , we need to be looking at .
ca : you 're saying that people of reason , people who would consider themselves not racists , but moral , upstanding people , have a rationale that says humans are just too different ; that we 're in danger of overloading our sense of what humans are capable of , by mixing in people who are too different .
jh : yes , but i can make it much more palatable by saying it 's not necessarily about race .
we saw it in britain , we 've seen it all over europe .
so an assimilationist approach to immigration removes a lot of these problems .
what are other causes ?
and when you bring group interests into account , so it 's not just me , it 's my team versus your team , whereas if you 're evaluating evidence that your side is wrong , we just ca n't accept that .
so this is why you ca n't win a political argument .
`` so now , give us the internet , give us google : `` '' i heard that barack obama was born in kenya . ''
jh : that 's right .
what 's changed that 's deepened this feeling of division ?
jh : you have to see six to ten different threads all coming together .
i 'll just list a couple of them .
so in america , one of the big — actually , america and europe — one of the biggest ones is world war ii .
they all retire by the '90s .
so we 're left with baby boomers by the end of the '90s .
and their youth was spent fighting each other within each country , in 1968 and afterwards .
another , in america , is the purification of the two parties .
there used to be liberal republicans and conservative democrats .
so america had a mid-20th century that was really bipartisan .
`` one , against a picture of racist graffiti : `` '' this is disgusting ! ''
`` ugliness in this country , brought to us by # trump . '' '' and then the next one is : `` crooked hillary dedication page . disgusting ! '' ''
disgust , i 've heard you say , takes things to a much deeper level .
and then we want nothing to do with them .
and that 's why i think we 're seeing it , for example , on campus now .
i 'm afraid that this whole generation of young people , if their introduction to politics involves a lot of disgust , they 're not going to want to be involved in politics as they get older .
ca : so how do we deal with that ?
disgust . how do you defuse disgust ?
disgust is closing off , borders .
love is about dissolving walls .
so personal relationships , i think , are probably the most powerful means we have .
and then gradually that chips away or changes your category as well .
the tragedy is , americans used to be much more mixed up in the their towns by left-right or politics .
`` ca : what would you say to someone or say to americans , people generally , about what we should understand about each other that might help us rethink for a minute this `` '' disgust '' '' instinct ? ''
`` a really important thing to keep in mind — there 's research by political scientist alan abramowitz , showing that american democracy is increasingly governed by what 's called `` '' negative partisanship . '' '' that means you think , ok there 's a candidate , you like the candidate , you vote for the candidate . ''
`` and now every republican , i can paint with all the things that i think about trump . '' '' and that 's not necessarily true . ''
and so if you 're within the blue matrix , everything 's completely compelling that the other side — they 're troglodytes , they 're racists , they 're the worst people in the world , and you have all the facts to back that up .
there are a lot of threats to this country , and each side is constitutionally incapable of seeing them all .
ca : so , are you saying that we almost need a new type of empathy ?
and we apply it to the poor , the needy , the suffering .
we do n't usually apply it to people who we feel as other , or we 're disgusted by .
jh : actually , i think ...
so it 's important to empathize with the groups that we on the left think are so important .
but empathy really should get you points if you do it when it 's hard to do .
but i think this year , i 'm hoping it will make people see that we have an existential threat on our hands .
and yes , we need a new kind of empathy .
so if you want to escape from this , read buddha , read jesus , read marcus aurelius .
so i think you have to make an effort — that 's the main thing .
everybody has a cousin , a brother-in-law , somebody who 's on the other side .
so , after this election — wait a week or two , because it 's probably going to feel awful for one of you — but wait a couple weeks , and then reach out and say you want to talk .
`` and before you do it , read dale carnegie , `` '' how to win friends and influence people '' '' — ( laughter ) i 'm totally serious . ''
ca : jon , it 's absolutely fascinating speaking with you .
it really does feel like the ground that we 're on is a ground populated by deep questions of morality and human nature .
( applause )
if you understand the difference between 'the world ' and 'my world , ' you understand the difference between logos and mythos .
but these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard .
which is right ?
and then globalization is taking place .
it is bound to happen .
i did not want to study surgery . do n't ask me why .
so , i will not answer the question .
you see , because both the paradigms are human constructions .
it was a machine that was never built , and yet , it will be built .
if you know anything about the history of computers , you will know that in the '30s and the '40s , simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today , and you would be correct , except for you 'd have the wrong century .
the first computer was really designed in the 1830s and 1840s , not the 1930s and 1940s .
now , i have a great affinity for charles babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture . ( laughter ) he was a very wealthy man , and a sort of , part of the aristocracy of britain , and on a saturday night in marylebone , were you part of the intelligentsia of that period , you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree — and he invited everybody : kings , the duke of wellington , many , many famous people — and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines .
he 's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them .
the reason he never made any of them , he 's a classic nerd .
so as i go through this talk , i want you to imagine this gigantic machine . we heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like .
and i 'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine — that 's why it 's computer architecture — and tell you about this machine , which is a computer .
so let 's talk about the memory . the memory is very like the memory of a computer today , except it was all made out of metal , stacks and stacks of cogs , 30 cogs high .
imagine a thing this high of cogs , hundreds and hundreds of them , and they 've got numbers on them .
it 's a decimal machine . everything 's done in decimal .
so he 's got memory .
the memory is this bit over here .
of course , it 's this big .
completely mechanical . this whole machine is mechanical .
`` it could do the `` '' if then '' '' for basic programmers , and that fundamentally made it into a computer . ''
it could compute . it could n't just calculate . it could do more .
yet if you did , you would see something very , very similar to this .
if you 've ever seen an electron microscope picture , you 'll see this . this all looks the same , then there 's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated .
all this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does , but of course you need to program this thing , and of course , babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the '50s , '60s and '70s , which is punch cards . this thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here , and this is a program in the science museum , just not far from here , created by charles babbage , that is sitting there — you can go see it — waiting for the machine to be built .
babbage , of course , wanted to use proven technology , so steam and things .
now , he needed accessories .
obviously , you 've got a computer now .
you need accessories you 're going to come with .
`` you 're not just going to have that , so , first of all , you had sound . you had a bell , so if anything went wrong — ( laughter ) — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it , there was a bell it could ring . ( laughter ) and there 's actually an instruction on the punch card which says `` '' ring the bell . '' '' so you can imagine this `` '' ting ! '' '' you know , just stop for a moment , imagine all those noises , this thing , `` '' click , clack click click click , '' '' steam engine , `` '' ding , '' '' right ? ( laughter ) you also need a printer , obviously , and everyone needs a printer . ''
it 's completely mechanical , again , a printer .
it prints just numbers , because he was obsessed with numbers , but it does print onto paper , and it even does word wrapping , so if you get to the end of the line , it goes around like that .
`` i mean , if you 're going to do anything with graphics , so he said , `` '' well , i need a plotter . i 've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and i 'll make it plot . '' '' so he designed a plotter as well , and , you know , at that point , i think he got pretty much a pretty good machine . ''
along comes this woman , ada lovelace .
now , imagine these soirees , all these great and good comes along .
`` this lady is the daughter of the mad , bad and dangerous-to-know lord byron , and her mother , being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of lord byron 's madness and badness , thought , `` '' i know the solution : mathematics is the solution . ''
`` we 'll teach her mathematics . that 'll calm her down . '' '' ( laughter ) because of course , there 's never been a mathematician that 's gone crazy , so , you know , that 'll be fine . ( laughter ) everything 'll be fine . so she 's got this mathematical training , and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother , and charles babbage , you know , gets out his machine . ''
now , some people call her the first programmer .
it 's not , historically , totally accurate that she 's the first programmer , and actually , she did something more amazing .
if you go into that phone , every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics . it 's all numbers at the bottom .
now , a hundred years later , this guy comes along , alan turing , and in 1936 , and invents the computer all over again .
now , of course , babbage 's machine was entirely mechanical .
`` he laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science , and said , `` it does n't matter how you make a computer . '' ''
it does n't matter if your computer 's mechanical , like babbage 's was , or electronic , like computers are today , or perhaps in the future , cells , or , again , mechanical again , once we get into nanotechnology .
there is in a sense a computing essence .
this is called the church–turing thesis .
and so suddenly , you get this link where you say this thing babbage had built really was a computer .
in fact , it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers , only really slowly . ( laughter ) to give you an idea of how slowly , it had about 1k of memory .
it used punch cards , which were being fed in , and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first zx81 .
you could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to .
( laughter ) so , where does that bring us today ?
so there are plans .
over in swindon , the science museum archives , there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by charles babbage about this analytical engine .
the project has a number of parts to it .
that 's been done . the second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build .
`` when it 's built , you 'll finally be able to understand how a computer works , because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you , you 've got to look at this humongous thing and say , `` '' ah , i see the memory operating , i see the cpu operating , i hear it operating . i probably smell it operating . '' '' ( laughter ) but in between that we 're going to do a simulation . ''
babbage himself wrote , he said , as soon as the analytical engine exists , it will surely guide the future course of science .
thank you very much . ( applause )
i do n't know why , but i 'm continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the internet and that at any point in time more than 30 percent of the world 's population can go online to learn , to create and to share .
and the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continuing to go grow .
( laughter ) but just as the internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us , it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world .
and with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen , we are like hansel and gretel leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods .
we are leaving our birthdays , our places of residence , our interests and preferences , our relationships , our financial histories , and on and on it goes .
in fact , when i know the data that 's being shared and i 'm asked explicitly for my consent , i want some sites to understand my habits .
it helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with .
but when i do n't know and when i have n't been asked , that 's when the problem arises .
it 's a phenomenon on the internet today called behavioral tracking , and it is very big business .
this is an area today that has very few regulations and even fewer rules .
all of them are connected , as you can see , to form a picture of me on the web .
i installed collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago and i let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day .
now like most of you , i actually start my day going online and checking email .
and in this particular case i happened to like one of them on the merits of music literacy in schools and i shared it over a social network .
i have navigated to a total of four .
this is nothing . i am being stalked across the web .
pretty simple — it 's huge business .
the revenue of the top handful of companies in this space is over 39 billion dollars today .
this is a nine-year-old girl navigating to principally children 's sites .
this is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate ; this is me being a parent .
imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement .
we 'd take action . it may not be good action , but we would take action .
( laughter ) we ca n't sit idly by here either .
you can download it , install it in firefox , to see who is tracking you across the web and following you through the digital woods .
because what we do n't know can actually hurt us .
because the memory of the internet is forever .
thank you .
`` so little billy goes to school , and he sits down and the teacher says , `` what does your father do ? '' ''
`` and little billy says , `` '' my father plays the piano in an opium den . '' '' so the teacher rings up the parents , and says , `` '' very shocking story from little billy today . ''
four hundred years of maturing democracy , colleagues in parliament who seem to me , as individuals , reasonably impressive , an increasingly educated , energetic , informed population , and yet a deep , deep sense of disappointment .
my colleagues in parliament include , in my new intake , family doctors , businesspeople , professors , distinguished economists , historians , writers , army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors .
all of them , however , including myself , as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road , feel that we 've become less than the sum of our parts , feel as though we have become profoundly diminished .
ten years ago , however , the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary . george w. bush stood up in his state of the union address in 2003 and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world . he said , because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors , freedom will bring peace .
distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits .
since then , what 's happened ?
do we find a flourishing civil society , a vigorous rule of law and good security ? no . what we find in afghanistan is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt , a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective , a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that 's deeply unpopular , perceived as being deeply corrupt , and security that is shocking , security that 's terrible .
in pakistan , in lots of sub-saharan africa , again you can see democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments , with states that are unstable and dangerous .
well , obviously not . it would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in , in iraq and afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which we were imposing anything other than a democratic system .
i remember in iraq , for example , that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy .
`` the result was that i found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people , this is actually a photograph taken in libya but i saw the same scene in iraq of people standing outside screaming for the elections , and when i went out and said , `` '' what is wrong with the interim provincial council ? ''
what is wrong with the people that we have chosen ?
`` there is a sunni sheikh , there 's a shiite sheikh , there 's the seven — leaders of the seven major tribes , there 's a christian , there 's a sabian , there are female representatives , there 's every political party in this council , what 's wrong with the people that we chose ? '' '' the answer came , `` '' the problem is n't the people that you chose . the problem is that you chose them . '' '' i have not met , in afghanistan , in even the most remote community , anybody who does not want a say in who governs them . ''
most remote community , i have never met a villager who does not want a vote .
we need to get away from instrumental arguments .
we need to get away from saying democracy matters because of the other things it brings .
we need to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights matters because of the other things it brings , or women 's rights matters for the other things it brings .
why should we get away from those arguments ?
the point about democracy is not instrumental .
it 's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors .
the point about democracy is intrinsic .
democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty . it reflects an idea of dignity , the dignity of the individual , the idea that each individual should have an equal vote , an equal say , in the formation of their government .
but if we 're really to make democracy vigorous again , if we 're ready to revivify it , we need to get involved in a new project of the citizens and the politicians .
democracy is not simply a question of structures .
it is a state of mind . it is an activity .
and part of that activity is honesty .
`` after i speak to you today , i 'm going on a radio program called `` '' any questions , '' '' and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never , ever say that they do n't know the answer to a question . it does n't matter what it is . ''
we need to stop that , to stop pretending to be omniscient beings .
and the second thing we should do is understand the genius of our societies .
one of the reasons why we 're moving away from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand , banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling of kings enthroned , the entire drama played out here on this space , where the king of england had his head lopped off , why we 've moved from spaces like this , thrones like that , towards the town hall , is we 're moving more and more towards the energies of our people , and we need to tap that .
in britain , it could mean looking to the french , learning from the french , getting directly elected mayors in place in a french commune system .
but for any of these things to work , the honesty in language , the local democracy , it 's not just a question of what politicians do .
it 's a question of what the citizens do .
for politicians to be honest , the public needs to allow them to be honest , and the media , which mediates between the politicians and the public , needs to allow those politicians to be honest .
third , you reward effort .
we just want to go back and find out more .
do you remember the story of odysseus and the sirens from high school or junior high school ?
`` and these women sing an enchanting song , a song so alluring that all sailors who hear it crash into the rocks and die . '' '' now you would expect , given that , that they would choose an alternate route around the sirens , but instead odysseus says , `` '' i want to hear that song . ''
`` and so what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to pour wax in the ears of you and all the men — stay with me — so that you ca n't hear the song , and then i 'm going to have you tie me to the mast so that i can listen and we can all sail by unaffected . '' '' so this is a captain putting the life of every single person on the ship at risk so that he can hear a song . ''
and i 'd like to think if this was the case , they probably would have rehearsed it a few times .
`` odysseus would have said , `` '' okay , let 's do a dry run . ''
`` and odysseus does his best job playacting and says , `` '' untie me . untie me . ''
`` i want to hear that song . untie me . '' '' and the first mate wisely resists and does n't untie odysseus . ''
`` and then odysseus says , `` '' i see that you can get it . ''
`` all right , untie me now and we 'll get some dinner . '' '' and the first mate hesitates . ''
`` now just do n't untie me no matter what . '' '' he throws the first mate to the ground . ''
hilarity ensues .
a commitment device is a decision that you make with a cool head to bind yourself so that you do n't do something regrettable when you have a hot head .
scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation .
there is first , the present self .
he just wants to get to the front row .
this is odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife penelope outside of ithaca — the other one .
so why do we need commitment devices ?
`` well resisting temptation is hard , as the 19th century english economist nassau william senior said , `` '' to abstain from the enjoyment which is in our power , or to seek distant rather than immediate results , are among the most painful exertions of the human will . '' '' if you set goals for yourself and you 're like a lot of other people , you probably realize it 's not that your goals are physically impossible that 's keeping you from achieving them , it 's that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them . ''
it 's physically possible to lose weight .
i mean , let 's face it , the present self is present .
it 's in control . it 's in power right now .
and the future self is not even around .
it does n't even have a lawyer present .
there 's nobody to stick up for the future self .
now i 'm a big fan of commitment devices actually .
i was creating commitment devices of my own long before i knew what they were .
and when you try to execute these commitment devices , you realize the devil is really in the details .
but then i thought , oh , i 'm sending myself mixed messages .
so ultimately , i just decided i would leave it in an envelope on the subway .
sometimes a good person would find it , sometimes a bad person would find it .
( laughter ) such it is with commitment devices .
but despite my like for them , there 's two nagging concerns that i 've always had about commitment devices , and you might feel this if you use them yourself .
so the first is , when you 've got one of these devices going , such as this contract to write everyday or pay , it 's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control .
`` you 're just telling yourself , `` '' without you , commitment device , i am nothing , i have no self-discipline . '' '' and then when you 're ever in a situation where you do n't have a commitment device in place — like , `` '' oh my god , that person 's offering me a doughnut , and i have no defense mechanism , '' '' — you just eat it . ''
so i do n't like the way that they take the power away from you .
i think self-discipline is something , it 's like a muscle .
the more you exercise it , the stronger it gets .
the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .
`` and so there 's no way that this is going to work . '' '' so in effect , you are like odysseus and the first mate in one person . ''
you 're putting yourself , you 're binding yourself , and you 're weaseling your way out of it , and then you 're beating yourself up afterwards .
so i 've been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people 's relationship to the future self without using commitment devices .
now saving is a classic two selves problem .
it wants to consume .
so this is a timely problem .
there 's a philosopher , derek parfit , who said some words that were inspiring to my coauthors and i .
of course , we know that we 're going to get old .
so my coauthors and i have used computers , the greatest tool of our time , to assist people 's imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future .
the first is called the distribution builder .
each outcome is shown by one of these markers , and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement .
being up at the top means that you 're enjoying a high income in retirement .
being down at the bottom means that you 're struggling to make ends meet .
`` when you make an investment , what you 're really saying is , `` '' i accept that any one of these 100 things could happen to me and determine my wealth . '' '' now you can try to move your outcomes around . ''
it means that you have to save more today .
`` once you find an investment that you 're happy with , what people do is they click `` '' done '' '' and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one . ''
it simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out .
at the end , there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement .
this is a simulation that uses graphics , but other people find motivating what money can buy , not just numbers .
so here i made a distribution builder where instead of showing numerical outcomes , i show people what those outcomes will get you , in particular apartments that you can afford if you 're retiring on 3,000 , 2,500 , 2,000 dollars per month and so on .
those are actual pictures of actual apartments renting for that amount as advertised on the internet .
the last thing i 'll show you , the last behavioral time machine , is something that i created with hal hershfield , who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project , bill sharpe .
so this is one of our experiments .
you can see his current annual income — this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today — is quite high , 91 percent , but his retirement income is quite low .
he 's going to retire on 44 percent of what he earned while he was working .
and just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider .
the younger face gets happier and happier , saving nothing .
the older face is miserable .
the younger face is getting unhappy .
we 're going to see if this has an effect on what people do .
there are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke , if they get too much exposure to the sun , if they gain weight and so on .
and just for kicks we ran his picture through the balding , aging and weight gain software to see how he would look .
and i 'll close it there .
( applause )
they did not invent car-sharing .
it also has a very low carbon footprint .
you have to cut down the biodiverse forest if you want to get the field to grow the corn to feed people with , and so there 's a constant push-pull there .
but in the oceans , we do n't have that war .
now , there 's a catch .
one billion people in the world today do not have access to all-season roads .
so we saw this and we thought , can there be a better way ?
imagine this scenario .
what would you do today ?
well , you would place a request via mobile phone , and someone would get the request immediately .
that 's the part that works .
the medication may take days to arrive , though , because of bad roads .
that 's the part that 's broken .
this can transport a small payload today , about two kilograms , over a short distance , about 10 kilometers , but it 's part of a wider network that may cover the entire country , maybe even the entire continent .
it 's an ultra-flexible , automated logistics network .
we call it matternet .
the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
let 's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail .
these are able to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes .
compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world , or even being stuck in traffic in a developed world country .
so they use gps and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations .
every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism , so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations , they dock , swap a battery automatically , and go out again .
the ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground .
they are at known locations on the ground , so the paths between them are also known , which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network .
the last component is the operating system that manages the whole network .
it monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions , avoid other risk factors , and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network .
here we are flying in haiti last summer , where we 've done our first field trials .
we 're modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake .
and i want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close .
we use this in all sorts of weather conditions , very hot and very cold climates , very strong winds . they 're very sturdy vehicles .
imagine if your life depended on this package , somewhere in africa or in new york city , after sandy .
the next big question is , what 's the cost ?
well , it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle is just 24 cents .
( applause ) and it 's counterintuitive , but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today , and we 're just at the beginning of this .
so we said , okay , how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world ?
the problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they 're being collected to hospitals where they 're being analyzed ?
and we said , what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around 140 square kilometers ?
that 's roughly one and a half times the size of manhattan .
well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars .
compare this to normal infrastructure investments .
we think this can be — this is the power of a new paradigm .
if it is a new paradigm , though , there must be other uses for it .
it can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
so let 's look at the other end of the spectrum : our cities and megacities .
china alone is adding a megacity the size of new york city every two years .
these are places that do have road infrastructure , but it 's very inefficient .
congestion is a huge problem .
so we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the internet , initially for lightweight , urgent stuff , and over time , we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem .
it 's ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint , operating in the background 24/7 , just like the internet .
so why are we doing this ?
imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them to information .
imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter .
in the developing world , we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines , reach them with better medication .
it would give us an unfair advantage against battling hiv/aids , tuberculosis and other epidemics .
the recent debate over copyright laws like sopa in the united states and the acta agreement in europe has been very emotional .
and i think some dispassionate , quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate .
i 'd therefore like to propose that we employ , we enlist , the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject .
for instance , just recently the motion picture association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft .
( laughter ) ... if we use pennies .
but it 's also a morally important one .
because this is n't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we 're talking about , but this is actual economic losses .
this is the equivalent to the entire american corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops , as well as wheat , tobacco , rice , sorghum — whatever sorghum is — losing sorghum .
so that 's a chunk of what we 're looking for .
and tv , satellite and cable revenues are way up .
other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up .
and some people think that string theory is tough .
it 's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated .
hollywood and congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law .
some people think this number 's a little bit large , but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it does n't get compounded for inflation every year .
now when this law first passed , the world 's hottest mp3 player could hold just 10 songs .
and it was a big christmas hit .
because what little hoodlum would n't want a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket .
( laughter ) ( applause ) these days an ipod classic can hold 40,000 songs , which is to say eight billion dollars-worth of stolen media . ( applause )
or about 75,000 jobs .
( laughter ) ( applause ) now you might find copyright math strange , but that 's because it 's a field that 's best left to experts .
so that 's it for now .
i hope you 'll join me next time when i will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he american economy .
thank you very much .
martine rothblatt : this is me with our oldest son eli .
i asked her to dance .
tell us about that .
ca : wow . so who here has used sirius ?
my youngest daughter did an absolutely brilliant five-year-old thing .
what was your thesis in this book ?
and while people may have the genitals of a male or a female , the genitals do n't determine your gender or even really your sexual identity .
ca : so how did you respond to that ?
ca : so how on earth did you get access to this drug ?
mr : absolutely , chris .
it 's actually not rocket science .
ca : but it 's not just bodies that — though that is amazing .
it 's long-lasting minds .
how do you describe that ?
mr : this is a robot version of my beloved spouse , bina .
and we call her bina 48 .
she was programmed by hanson robotics out of texas .
mr : yes . not just bina , but everybody .
i consider that puzzles are an art form .
not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense .
`` here 's the word `` '' mirror . '' '' no , it 's not the same upside-down . ''
and you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge .
there is only one solution . it 's not that hard .
and depending on which one weighs which amount , they 'll fall different directions .
`` then recently `` '' rock band '' '' has been a big hit . ''
where is that ?
the third category is represented by warren buffet , which i call aggregated giving .
but i 'm really hopeful .
our future does n't have to be imagined .
number two : do n't compete with food crops .
we are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this .
all the stars for kepler are just points of light .
we do that in our solar system .
the universe and life are both in space and time .
this is very significant .
they staged girls ' school theater .
and recently , i 've actually been combining both .
this is the hi-seas program .
busy , busy work .
i learned a lot about how individual crew members actually cope with a situation like this ; how you can keep a crew productive and happy , for example , giving them a good deal of autonomy is a good trick to do that ; and honestly , i learned a lot about leadership , because i was a crew commander .
the first version was done in belgium and holland .
it was built with a team of almost 50 people .
it 's an evolving artwork , evolving architecture .
this was the last version that was just presented a few weeks ago in holland , which was using caravans as modules to build a starship .
what are the causes ? well , it 's an unintended consequence .
but as it turns out , we know a lot more about space than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet , the very lifeblood of mother earth .
so i decided to do something that was even more remarkable .
well , that 's my workplace .
and my voice is the one that 's going to teach you about the inside of mother earth .
it 's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks .
this technology enables us to go deeper than we could 've imagined even 10 years ago .
it turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life-forms , species that we never knew existed before .
in fact , animals swimming in these caves today are identical in the fossil record that predates the extinction of the dinosaurs .
what can they teach us about evolution and survival ?
i also work with physicists , and they 're interested oftentimes in global climate change .
so it 's been picked up by wind , blown across the atlantic ocean .
it 's rained down in this case on the island of abaco in the bahamas .
but my very favorite project of all was over 15 years ago , when i was a part of the team that made the very first accurate , three-dimensional map of a subterranean surface .
it 's a shared resource from which we all drink .
and when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater and all of our water resources on this planet , then we 'll be working on the problem that 's probably the most important issue of this century .
and that 's pretty amazing .
and he orders a pint , and they sit in silence for a while .
i built this bar with my bare hands from the finest wood in the county .
gave it more love and care than my own child .
`` but do they call me macgregor the bar builder ? no . '' '' points out the window . ''
`` `` '' you see that stone wall out there ? ''
i built that stone wall with my bare hands .
`` but you fuck one goat ... `` '' ( laughter ) storytelling — ( laughter ) is joke telling . ''
it 's knowing your punchline , your ending , knowing that everything you 're saying , from the first sentence to the last , is leading to a singular goal , and ideally confirming some truth that deepens our understandings of who we are as human beings .
we 're born for them .
stories affirm who we are .
we all want affirmations that our lives have meaning .
`` the children 's television host mr. rogers always carried in his wallet a quote from a social worker that said , `` '' frankly , there is n't anyone you could n't learn to love once you 've heard their story . '' '' and the way i like to interpret that is probably the greatest story commandment , which is `` '' make me care '' '' — please , emotionally , intellectually , aesthetically , just make me care . ''
it 's already halfway over , but something 's caught you and you 're drawn in and you care .
so it got me thinking , what if i told you my history was story , how i was born for it , how i learned along the way this subject matter ?
and to make it more interesting , we 'll start from the ending and we 'll go to the beginning .
and so if i were going to give you the ending of this story , it would go something like this : and that 's what ultimately led me to speaking to you here at ted about story .
and the most current story lesson that i 've had was completing the film i 've just done this year in 2012 .
`` the film is `` '' john carter . '' '' it 's based on a book called `` '' the princess of mars , '' '' which was written by edgar rice burroughs . ''
and edgar rice burroughs actually put himself as a character inside this movie , and as the narrator .
( video ) butler : you wo n't find a keyhole .
thing only opens from the inside .
he insisted , no embalming , no open coffin , no funeral .
you do n't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded by being like the rest of us , huh ?
come , let 's go inside .
as : what this scene is doing , and it did in the book , is it 's fundamentally making a promise .
it 's making a promise to you that this story will lead somewhere that 's worth your time .
you could do it an infinite amount of ways .
`` sometimes it 's as simple as `` '' once upon a time ... `` '' these carter books always had edgar rice burroughs as a narrator in it . ''
and i always thought it was such a fantastic device .
`` it did n't happen to me , it happened to somebody else , but it 's going to be worth your time . '' '' a well told promise is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot and propels you forward through the story to the end . ''
in 2008 , i pushed all the theories that i had on story at the time to the limits of my understanding on this project .
( video ) ( mechanical sounds ) ♫ and that is all ♫ ♫ that love 's about ♫ ♫ and we 'll recall ♫ ♫ when time runs out ♫ ♫ that it only ♫ ( laughter ) as : storytelling without dialogue .
they just do n't want to know that they 're doing that .
there 's a reason that we 're all attracted to an infant or a puppy .
the elements you provide and the order you place them in is crucial to whether you succeed or fail at engaging the audience .
editors and screenwriters have known this all along .
i do n't mean to make it sound like this is an actual exact science , it 's not .
i took a seminar in this year with an acting teacher named judith weston .
she believed that all well-drawn characters have a spine .
and it 's something that always drove all his choices .
wall-e 's was to find the beauty .
and woody 's was to do what was best for his child .
and these spines do n't always drive you to make the best choices .
all you can do is learn to recognize it and own it .
and some of us are born with temperaments that are positive , some are negative .
they 're learning who they are .
so we 're all learning all the time .
if things go static , stories die , because life is never static .
so i wanted to become much better at it and learn anything i could .
so i researched everything i possibly could .
`` and i finally came across this fantastic quote by a british playwright , william archer : `` '' drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty . '' '' it 's an incredibly insightful definition . ''
when you 're telling a story , have you constructed anticipation ?
have you constructed honest conflicts with truth that creates doubt in what the outcome might be ?
`` you 've got to remember that in this time of year , 1993 , what was considered a successful animated picture was `` '' the little mermaid , '' '' `` '' beauty and the beast , '' '' `` aladdin , '' `` lion king . '' ''
`` so when we pitched `` '' toy story '' '' to tom hanks for the first time , he walked in and he said , `` you do n't want me to sing , do you ? '' ''
and i thought that epitomized perfectly what everybody thought animation had to be at the time .
but we really wanted to prove that you could tell stories completely different in animation .
and we got a hold of that fax .
`` and the fax said , there should be songs , there should be an `` '' i want '' '' song , there should be a happy village song , there should be a love story and there should be a villain . ''
that just gave us more determination to prove that you could build a better story .
and it just went to prove that storytelling has guidelines , not hard , fast rules .
another fundamental thing we learned was about liking your main character .
`` and we had naively thought , well woody in `` '' toy story '' '' has to become selfless at the end , so you 've got to start from someplace . ''
off the bed .
woody : no , he is .
i said , take care of them .
slinky : i 'm sorry , woody , but i have to agree with them .
i do n't think what you did was right .
woody : what ? am i hearing correctly ?
who said your job was to think , spring wiener ?
as : so how do you make a selfish character likable ?
and that 's what it really is , is that we all live life conditionally .
after that , all bets are off .
and before i 'd even decided to make storytelling my career , i can now see key things that happened in my youth that really sort of opened my eyes to certain things about story .
and i saw that thing seven times in one month .
i could n't get enough of it .
yet , there was something more being said . what exactly was it ?
and it was n't until , on one of my later viewings , that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he 's walked across the sinai desert and he 's reached the suez canal , and i suddenly got it .
( video ) boy : hey ! hey ! hey ! hey !
cyclist : who are you ? who are you ?
as : that was the theme : who are you ? here were all these seemingly disparate
events and dialogues that just were chronologically telling the history of him , but underneath it was a constant , a guideline , a road map .
and this is what my mother took me to when i was five .
( video ) thumper : come on . it 's all right .
look .
the water 's stiff .
come on . get up .
like this .
ha ha . no , no , no .
it ca n't be artificially evoked .
for me , there 's no greater ability than the gift of another human being giving you that feeling — to hold them still just for a brief moment in their day and have them surrender to wonder .
and when an artist does that to another artist , it 's like you 're compelled to pass it on .
it 's like a dormant command that suddenly is activated in you , like a call to devil 's tower .
do unto others what 's been done to you .
the best stories infuse wonder .
and he said i had a matching pair like that on my head , but i could n't see them because of my hair .
i do n't know if my parents really believe that , but i did n't want to prove them wrong .
it 's okay , daddy 's here .
daddy 's got you .
i promise , i will never let anything happen to you , nemo .
as : and that 's the first story lesson i ever learned .
( applause )
i was 17 and going on a peace walk .
i started going out on cases .
and we would come in and talk to them , usually for about a week .
and today , after briefly describing what they found , i 'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery , namely the possibility that way beyond the earth , the milky way and other distant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse .
now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one .
`` i mean , most of us were raised to believe that the word `` '' universe '' '' means everything . ''
finally , in part three , i 'm going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation , which will pull all the pieces of the story together .
okay , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer edwin hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretching , it 's expanding .
the prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static .
now let 's fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers i mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing .
now if you saw an apple do that , you 'd want to know why .
what 's pushing on it ?
well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of einstein 's .
you see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pulls objects together .
but in einstein 's theory of gravity , his general theory of relativity , gravity can also push things apart .
how ? well according to einstein 's math , if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy , sort of like a uniform , invisible mist , then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive , repulsive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observations .
here it is .
this number is small .
we want this number to emerge from the laws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that .
maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue , a technical detail of interest to experts , but of no relevance to anybody else .
well it surely is a technical detail , but some details really matter .
so hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as i now go on to tell you three key things about string theory .
and the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward .
but there 's a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory does n't quite work .
but string theory says that , on fantastically small scales , there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them .
so particle masses , the strengths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions .
all we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math .
now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different candidate shapes , so you can imagine analyzing them one-by-one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe .
but then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions , until today .
the list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500 .
so , what to do ?
but others turned this issue on its head , taking us to the possibility of a multiverse .
each is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions .
because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical features of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different .
which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we 've now measured would take on a wholly different character .
in this context , the laws of physics ca n't explain one number for the dark energy because there is n't just one number , there are many numbers .
which means we have been asking the wrong question .
it 's that the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we 've measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there ?
because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies , the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies do n't form .
and in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies do n't form .
and without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes .
so we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we 've measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life .
and that would be that .
mystery solved , multiverse found .
now some find this explanation unsatisfying .
but the point is , if the feature you 're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality , then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided .
an early example comes from the great astronomer johannes kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number — why the sun is 93 million miles away from the earth .
kepler was asking the wrong question .
we now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
so we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life .
but there 's a little secret .
and this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the big bang theory .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
and this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting-edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider .
the inflationary theory already has strong observational support .
because the theory predicts that the big bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded , tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world , yielding a distinctive fingerprint , a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots , across space , which powerful telescopes have now observed .
and so exotic as this picture is , it may one day be grounded in observations , establishing the existence of other universes .
but because the expansion is speeding up , in the very far future , those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we wo n't be able to see them — not because of technological limitations , but because of the laws of physics .
so astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static , inky , black stillness .
now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era , like ours , attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies .
or would they believe in the black , static empty universe that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal ?
it appears that it may not always be that way .
because today 's astronomers , by turning powerful telescopes to the sky , have captured a handful of starkly informative photons — a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit .
sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law .
sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon .
( applause ) chris anderson : brian , thank you .
the range of ideas you 've just spoken about are dizzying , exhilarating , incredible .
when we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out , the natural question is , maybe we 're already in that position and certain deep , critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves .
so from that perspective , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them .
on the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is .
we can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago — and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
ca : you 're going to be around for the next few days .
something always seems to stop us .
`` in the newspaper it said `` it was all part of a normal process . '' ''
`` a little bit further on in the article it said `` '' a loss that would normally take the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace . '' '' that same word , `` '' normal , '' '' had two different , almost opposite meanings . ''
and yet i think it 's this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions .
only 90 days after this , arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred .
it was the sequencing for the first time of the human genome .
and if we just take one cell 's worth of this code and unwind it , it 's a meter long , two nanometers thick .
and what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy , the electron ?
six and a half years later , a hundred and eighty researchers , they have some amazing developments in the lab , and i will show you three of those today , such that we can stop burning up our planet and instead , we can generate all the energy we need right where we are , cleanly , safely , and cheaply .
think of the space that we spend most of our time .
we like the light that comes into the room , but in the middle of summer , all that heat is coming into the room that we 're trying to keep cool .
in winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
we 're trying to heat up the space that we 're in , and all that is trying to get out through the window .
would n't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in ?
how is that possible ?
one of the things about working at the nanoscale is things look and act very differently .
to change its state , by the way , takes two volts from a millisecond pulse .
and once you 've changed its state , it stays there until you change its state again .
we 'd have to see at night , right ?
it 's a film that you can look through .
and you can see , off a tiny film , incredible clarity .
what if we combined it with this ?
suddenly you 've converted energy into an electron on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window .
but because it 's flexible , it can be on any surface whatsoever .
the power plant of tomorrow is no power plant .
in terms of dollars per what 's stored , it 's simply the best .
knowing that we 're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power , we went to a group at university of texas at dallas , and we gave them this diagram .
ebox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside , hold it until you need it , and then be able to release it and pass it off .
it 's my energy .
and if i do n't need it , i can convert it back up on the window to energy , light , and beam it , line of site , to your place .
and for that i do not need an electric grid between us .
each of us , every day , need just eight glasses of this , because we 're human .
when we run out of water , as we are in some parts of the world and soon to be in other parts of the world , we 're going to have to get this from the sea , and that 's going to require us to build desalination plants .
we 're simply not going to do that .
but in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply , we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need .
i 'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists , no kinder than many of the people in the world , but they have a magic look at the world .
and i 'm glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world .
i 've carried this photograph with me every day since then .
by any standard this is wrong .
it 's just wrong .
we can do better than this .
it 'll never happen . you do n't have enough money .
you do n't have enough time .
`` there 's something much more interesting around the corner , '' '' i say , `` '' try saying that to her . '' '' that 's what i say in my mind . and i just say `` '' thank you , '' '' and i go on to the next one . ''
thank you .
( applause )
but if you keep looking further and further , eventually you see nothing for a long while , and then finally you see a faint , fading afterglow , and it 's the afterglow of the big bang .
now , the big bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small , incredibly hot , incredibly roiling mass , and from it sprung everything we see .
now , we 've mapped that afterglow with great precision , and when i say we , i mean people who are n't me .
now it 's been 14 billion years since that big bang , and so it 's got faint and cold .
it 's now 2.7 degrees .
but it 's not exactly 2.7 degrees .
it 's only 2.7 degrees to about 10 parts in a million .
but if you wait , that ringing fades and fades and fades until you do n't notice it anymore .
what they found on monday was evidence of the ringing of the space-time of the early universe , what we call gravitational waves from the fundamental era , and here 's how they found it .
if you go for a walk , you do n't wiggle .
so by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper — in fact , these guys spent three years on the south pole looking straight up through the coldest , clearest , cleanest air they possibly could find looking deep into the night sky and studying that glow and looking for the faint twists which are the symbol , the signal , of gravitational waves , the ringing of the early universe .
this is n't conclusive evidence for inflation , but anything that is n't inflation that explains this will look the same .
we 're never going to see the stuff outside , but by going to the south pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky , we can figure out that we 're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that .
thanks a lot .
( applause )
now look at the moon .
and this gained einstein prominence around the world .
the idea is like this .
it 's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy , vibrating in different frequencies .
the different frequencies produce the different particles .
the different particles are responsible for all the richness in the world around us .
and there you see unification , because matter particles , electrons and quarks , radiation particles , photons , gravitons , are all built up from one entity .
now here is the catch .
they have a very rich , intertwined geometry .
that place is called the stratosphere .
but the question i asked is , is it possible to linger in the stratosphere ?
three years later , this is what we have .
the suit itself can protect me from the cold .
it has two redundant oxygen tanks .
the main advantage of this system is weight and complexity .
that 's a helium truck in the background .
that 's where the helium is .
so the trip up is beautiful . it 's kind of like google earth in reverse .
this is what it looks like .
i 'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now .
there 's the balloon going by a second time .
right now , i 'm about at the speed of sound .
so nothing is possible without an amazing team of people .
yay .
so this is a start .
and as an inorganic chemist , my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic , living world and the inorganic , dead world .
and what i 'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic , dead matter into living matter , into inorganic biology .
before we do that , i want to kind of put biology in its place .
and i 'm absolutely enthralled by biology .
i love to do synthetic biology .
i love things that are alive .
i love manipulating the infrastructure of biology .
and evolution , although it was established well over 100 years ago by charles darwin and a vast number of other people , evolution still is a little bit intangible .
and when i talk about darwinian evolution , i mean one thing and one thing only , and that is survival of the fittest .
so bearing that in mind , as a chemist , i wanted to ask myself the question frustrated by biology : what is the minimal unit of matter that can undergo darwinian evolution ?
and this seems quite a profound question .
and as a chemist , we 're not used to profound questions every day .
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer .
and in fact , the smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is , in fact , a single cell — a bacteria .
is biology special ?
biologists seem to think so .
now if we answer those questions in reverse order , the third question — is matter evolvable ? — if we can answer that , then we 're going to know how special biology is , and maybe , just maybe , we 'll have some idea of what life really is .
and you can see , it 's kind of pollinating , germinating , growing .
this is an inorganic tube .
and all these crystals here under the microscope were dead a few minutes ago , and they look alive .
it 's a chemistry experiment where i 've made a crystal garden .
but when i saw this , i was really fascinated , because it seemed lifelike .
you can see there 's architecture growing , filling the void .
so i was positive that , if somehow we can make things mimic life , let 's go one step further .
let 's see if we can actually make life .
in fact , we were the only people in the universe .
`` so as a chemist , i wanted to say , `` '' hang on . what is going on here ? ''
`` is life that improbable ? '' '' and this is really the question . ''
in fact , we have such amazing lifeforms that we can manipulate .
well what about matter ?
if we can make matter alive , would we have a matterhazard ?
so think , this is a serious question .
so we have to think differently if we 're going to make stuff come alive .
and forgive the complicated diagram .
this is just a collection of pathways in the cell .
and the cell is obviously for us a fascinating thing .
but what does a cell do ?
but what else is life characterized by ?
and so what we have here is a description of single cells replicating , metabolizing , burning through chemistries .
so before we can really start to make life , we have to really think about where it came from .
imagine way back , four and a half billion years ago , there is a vast chemical soup of stuff .
so when you think about the improbable nature of what i 'm going to tell you in the next few minutes , just remember , we came from stuff on planet earth .
and we went through a variety of worlds .
we then got to the last ancestor .
but there 's a roadblock that you ca n't get past .
you can decode the genome , you can look back , you can link us all together by a mitochondrial dna , but we ca n't get further than the last ancestor , the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history .
so there are two options : intelligent design , direct and indirect — so god , or my friend .
i 'm not a politician , i 'm a scientist .
the other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity .
this seems most likely .
so we have some kind of primordial soup .
and this one happens to be a good source of all 20 amino acids .
and somehow these amino acids are combined , and life begins .
but life begins , what does that mean ?
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
so what we 're trying to do is do reactions — not in one flask , but in tens of flasks , and connect them together , as you can see with this flow system , all these pipes .
we can do it microfluidically , we can do it lithographically , we can do it in a 3d printer , we can do it in droplets for colleagues .
and the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away .
and the answer , of course , lies with mice .
this is how i remember what i need as a chemist .
`` i say , `` '' well i want molecules . '' '' but i need a metabolism , i need some energy . ''
because if i want evolution , i need containers to compete .
and the way to test it in the laboratory is to make it minimal .
so what we 're going to try and do is come up with an inorganic lego kit of molecules .
and so forgive the molecules on the screen , but these are a very simple kit .
carbon is banned .
and you can see on the screen a cell being made .
and we 're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell .
they 're all made of the same stuff , but they want their shape to win .
if we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete , they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete .
if we could get evolution into the material world , then i propose we should have a general theory of evolution .
does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe ?
so that means we could then start to develop different platforms for exploring this evolution .
so imagine we make a little cell .
the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything , because it 's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution .
and the profound realization for me is that , if this works , the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level , and we really start talking about selfish matter .
they 're inanimate , they 're not alive .
and we 're really becoming very close to understanding the key steps that makes dead stuff come alive .
and again , when you 're thinking about how improbable this is , remember , five billion years ago , we were not here , and there was no life .
but perhaps , for me as a chemist , i want to keep away from general terms ; i want to think about specifics .
so what does it mean about defining life ?
we really struggle to do this .
( applause ) chris anderson : just a quick question on timeline .
you believe you 're going to be successful in this project ?
when ?
lee cronin : so many people think that life took millions of years to kick in .
we 're proposing to do it in just a few hours , once we 've set up the right chemistry .
lc : hopefully within the next two years .
ca : that would be a big story .
so the other thing that if we were able to create life that 's not based on carbon , maybe we can tell nasa what really to look for .
a couple of years ago when i was attending the ted conference in long beach , i met harriet .
we were actually introduced because we both knew linda avey , one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies .
so ozzie , harriet and me .
and being the current day , of course , we started our own facebook group .
well the way i met harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross-disciplinary , exponentially-growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness — from low-cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio-informatics to the connection of the internet and social networking .
we often think linearly .
so if we start to think exponentially , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
and many of these technologies — speaking as a physician and innovator — we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care , and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today , ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population , the way we really do n't use information very well today , the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation .
so if you think about it , these are really dramatically improving .
i mean this is the iphone 4 .
imagine what the iphone 8 will be able to do .
i 've been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called singularity university based in silicon valley .
and we bring together every summer about 100 very talented students from around the world .
and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine , biotech , artificial intelligence , robotics , nanotechnology , space , and address how can we cross-train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals .
and coming up next month is actually future med , a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine .
there are all other sorts of applications , merging your phone and diagnostics , for example — measuring your blood glucose on your iphone and sending that , potentially , to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic .
let 's start with faster .
well it 's no secret that computers , through moore 's law , are speeding up faster and faster .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
they 're really approaching , in many cases surpassing , the ability of the human mind .
and by understanding these sorts of processes and these sorts of connections , we 're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective , for example , psychoactive drugs .
the scanners for these are getting small , less expensive and more portable .
how do you leverage that information ?
well now there 's essentially a virtual colonoscopy .
compare those two pictures , and now as a radiologist , you can essentially fly through your patient 's colon and , augmenting that with artificial intelligence , identify potentially , as you see here , a lesion .
and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that would n't have otherwise .
we 're moving to this integration of biomedicine , information technology , wireless and , i would say , mobile now — this era of digital medicine .
and of course , there 's an app for that .
we 're moving , obviously , to the era of the tricorder .
so the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope .
and merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records — in the united states , we 're still less than 20 percent electronic .
here in the netherlands , i think it 's more than 80 percent .
but now that we 're switching to merging medical data , making it available electronically , we can crowd source that information , and now as a physician , i can access my patients ' data from wherever i am just through my mobile device .
and just last month the first fda-approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices .
so certainly , the physicians of today , including myself , are completely reliable on these devices .
already today , you do n't need to go to your physician in many cases .
we 're now in the era of virtual visits — from sort of the skype-type visits you can do with american well , to cisco that 's developed a very complex health presence system .
the ability to interact with your health care provider is different .
here my friend jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so i can save her a trip to the emergency room — i can do some diagnostics that way .
we have wireless blood pressure cuffs .
now we 're also in the era , today , of quantified self .
i can measure my steps , my caloric outtake .
i can share that with my friends , with my physician .
`` it 's going to be `` '' check your body '' '' light , and go in and get it taken care of . ''
but it 's going to be here .
now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality .
so the surgeon can see inside the patient , through their lens , where the tumor is , where the blood vessels are .
this can be integrated with decisions support .
and this is called notes , and this is coming — basically scarless surgery , as mediated by robotic surgery .
and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients .
still in clinical trials , but imagine when we can connect these , for example , to the amazing bionic limb , such as the deka arm built by dean kamen and colleagues , which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who 's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they 've had in the past .
so we 're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually .
if you have n't lost a limb — you 've had a stroke , for example — you can wear these augmented limbs .
and i think by leveraging these sorts of technologies , we 're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability , or super-enabling .
this is aimee mullins , who lost her lower limbs as a young child , and hugh herr , who 's a professor at mit who lost his limbs in a climbing accident .
and now both of these can climb better , move faster , swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal-abled persons .
now how about other exponentials ?
clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction , including with huge costs .
but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller .
you can swallow this completely integrated device .
it can take pictures of your gi system , help diagnose and treat as it moves through your gi tract .
we get into even smaller micro-robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons ca n't do in a much less invasive manner .
sometimes these might self-assemble in your gi system and be augmented in that reality .
these are shrinking even further .
here 's one that 's in prototyping by medtronic that 's smaller than a penny .
artificial retinas , the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see .
again , in early trials , but moving into the future .
or for those of us who are sighted , how about having the assisted-living contact lens ?
now if you have trouble maintaining your diet , it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you .
microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians .
and this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under-served and enable what used to be thousand-dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point of care .
now how about exponentially cheaper ?
in genomics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
we 're now approaching essentially a thousand-dollar genome — probably next year to two years , probably a hundred-dollar genome .
and that 's when it gets interesting , when we start to crowdsource that information .
and we enter the era of true personalized medicine — the right drug for the right person at the right time — instead of what we 're doing today , which is the same drug for everybody — sort of blockbuster drug medications , medications which do n't work for you , the individual .
but if i take that same data , upload it to decodeme , i can look at my risk for sample type 2 diabetes .
i 'm at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes .
i might want to watch how much dessert i have at the lunch break for example .
it might change my behavior .
so again , it 's not just genes , it 's multiple details — our habits , our environmental exposure .
geomedicine : where you 've lived , what you 've been exposed to , can dramatically affect your health .
so genomics , proteomics , the environment , all this data streaming at us individually and us , as poor physicians , how do we manage it ?
and by looking at the patterns , for example , in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test , we can start to look at these little patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage .
this has been called by lee hood , the father of the field , p4 medicine .
through websites like patients like me or managing your data on microsoft healthvault or google health , leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important .
we 'd like to get therapies better and more effective .
now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills .
what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension ?
this is a new device that is essentially doing that .
it should be on the market within a year or two .
how about more targeted therapies for cancer ?
right , i 'm an oncologist and i have to say most of what we give is actually poison .
so if you think of cancer as a weed , we often can whack the weed away .
it seems to shrink , but it often comes back .
so we 're attacking the wrong target .
the cancer stem cells remain , and the tumor can return months or years later .
we also have adult stem cells throughout our body .
we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation .
geron , just last year , started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries .
it 's now been fda approved , and it 'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so .
but where is stem cell therapy really going ?
if you think about it , every cell in your body has the same dna as you had when you were an embryo .
but i think , as integration of exponential technologies , this is the example .
and i think by pulling these things together , if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these , we 're going to empower the patient , enable the doctor , enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick .
because i know as a doctor , if someone comes to me with stage i disease , i 'm thrilled — we can often cure them .
so by leveraging these technologies together , i think we 'll enter a new era that i like to call stage 0 medicine .
host : thank you . thank you .
( applause ) take a bow . take a bow .
well , you can imagine the delight over at general drafting .
it 's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world , right ?
because the world would truly be a different place if north were down .
so i was a really terrible student when i was a kid .
these people — in my , symbol-obsessed , twelve year-old imagination — these people who are strangling themselves as one of the first things they do each morning , they ca n't possibly be happy .
that 's a terrible end !
and then , when i was in tenth grade , i went to this school , indian springs school , a small boarding school , outside of birmingham , alabama .
and so i started to learn , because learning was cool .
i learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets , and i learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears .
what is the process of cartography ?
it 's true that i had teachers that did n't give up on me , and i was very fortunate to have those teachers , because i often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me .
i might know , you know , cantor 's idea that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets , but i did n't really understand the calculus behind that idea .
and so now i do know at least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff .
and then i wrote a book .
his name is ze frank .
`` ze frank was running , at the time , a show called `` '' the show with ze frank , '' '' and i discovered the show , and that was my way back into being a community learner again . ''
here 's ze talking about las vegas : ( video ) ze frank : las vegas was built in the middle of a huge , hot desert .
almost everything here was brought from somewhere else — the sort of rocks , the trees , the waterfalls .
`` i realize that these are silly ideas , but they are also `` '' learny '' '' ideas , and that was what was so exciting to me , and if you go online , you can find communities like this all over the place . ''
good question . there are two main reasons .
`` jg : or here 's a video that i made as part of my show `` '' crash course , '' '' talking about world war i : ( video ) the immediate cause was of course the assassination in sarajevo of the austrian archduke franz ferdinand , on june 28 , 1914 , by a bosnian-serb nationalist named gavrilo princip . ''
and then russia , due to its alliance with the serbs , mobilized its army .
which is odd , because it 's a cool topic , but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway .
so i guess that 's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum .
today 's question is : why ?
like most simple questions , there 's a very complex answer .
for instance , let me reword this question : how does a cat go from feet-up to feet-down in a falling reference frame , without violating the conservation of angular momentum ?
and because i 'm in comments usually , i get to participate with you .
thank you .
and i love information .
( laughter ) but what i want to do in the next eight minutes or so is to take you through how those passions developed , the point in my life when the two passions merged , the journey of learning that took place from that point .
and one idea i want to leave you with today is what would would happen differently in your life if you saw information the way you saw food ?
i was born in calcutta — a family where my father and his father before him were journalists , and they wrote magazines in the english language .
that was the family business .
and as a result of that , i grew up with books everywhere around the house .
and i mean books everywhere around the house .
and that 's actually a shop in calcutta , but it 's a place where we like our books .
by the time i was 18 , i had a deep passion for books .
and apparently it 's being remade right now and it 's going to be coming out next year .
`` and as it ran , this thing was saying , `` '' give me input . give me input . '' '' and i suddenly realized that for a robot both information as well as food were the same thing . ''
energy came to it in some form or shape , data came to it in some form or shape .
and i began to think , i wonder what it would be like to start imagining myself as if energy and information were the two things i had as input — as if food and information were similar in some form or shape .
and two of the most expensive tissues in our human body are nervous tissue and digestive tissue .
and what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995 .
it 's a lady named leslie aiello .
and the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other .
if you wanted your brain for a particular body mass to be large , you had to live with a smaller gut .
we moved from that to becoming farmers and cultivators of information .
does that really explain what we 're seeing with the intellectual property battles nowadays ?
because those people who were hunter-gatherers in origin wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted , and those that were in the business of farming information wanted to build fences around it , create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement .
so there was always going to be a tension within that .
and everything i saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers .
and this is happening here .
when i moved to preparation , this same thing was true , expect that there were two schools .
the same is again true with information .
do you go to a restaurant ?
the same is true every time as i started thinking about information .
the analogies were getting crazy — that information had sell-by dates , that people had misused information that was n't dated properly and could really make an effect on the stock market , on corporate values , etc .
are we going to reach the stage where information has a percentage for fact associated with it ?
which brings me to the final element of this .
fundamentally it 's a consumption issue .
and we have to start thinking about how we create diets within ourselves , exercise within ourselves , to have the faculties to be able to deal with information , to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly .
it has probably not helped my waistline any because i like practicing on both sides .
but i 'd like to leave you with just that question : if you began to think of all the information that you consume the way you think of food , what would you do differently ?
thank you very much for your time .
( applause )
so , we have this ability as well .
this may sound strange , but i 'm a big fan of the concrete block .
very quickly concrete blocks became the most-used construction unit in the world .
they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time .
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
it 's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced — or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
you do n't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
lego made it accessible .
lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you 've made a little blinker .
add this buzzer for some extra punch and you 've created a noise machine .
i 'm going to stop that .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors — everything should be accessible .
we 've been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them .
and it 's been an incredible experience .
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they do n't learn at schools .
for example , how a nightlight works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we 've also been taking littlebits to design schools .
so for example , we 've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littlebits as a material .
`` ( clanging ) ( buzzing ) a few weeks ago we took littlebits to risd and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever — just cardboard , wood and paper — and told them `` '' make something . '' '' here 's an example of a project they made , a motion-activated confetti canon ball . ''
( laughter ) but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
( laughter ) to these non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
you can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
thank you .
( applause )
now , i know everyone thinks that their kid is the most fantastic , the most beautiful kid that ever lived .
any student i 've had the honor of teaching in my classroom is my kid .
i was n't supposed to have fully resourced biology or chemistry labs , school buses that brought me door-to-door , freshly prepared school lunches or even air conditioning .
these are things my kids do n't get .
there are thousands of other kids just like me , who deserve this , too .
why does n't everyone get this ?
why is a high-quality education only exclusive to the rich ?
i now teach in the very same school system from which i sought refuge .
there have been countless nights when i 've cried in frustration , anger and sorrow , because i ca n't teach my kids the way that i was taught , because i do n't have access to the same resources or tools that were used to teach me .
my kids deserve so much better .
is it really that hard to understand why these kids perform well and these kids do n't ?
while african-americans were enslaved and prohibited from schooling , their labor established the very institution from which they were excluded .
ever since then , every court case , educational policy , reform , has been an attempt to retrofit the design , rather than just stopping and acknowledging : we 've had it all wrong from the beginning .
but while we all know things were indeed separate , they were in no ways equal .
they know that when it comes to schooling , black lives do n't matter and they never have .
for years , i tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading .
`` every day there were new deliveries and my kids would exclaim with glee , `` this feels like christmas ! '' ''
`` ( laughter ) then they 'd say , `` ms. sumner , where did these books come from ? '' ''
`` ( laughter ) to which i 'd reply , `` you deserve brand-new books . '' ''
`` but to know that a stranger , someone i do n't even know , cares this much about me is pretty cool . '' '' knowing that strangers will take care of you is a privilege my kids are n't afforded . ''
`` we get to a catastrophe and we wonder , `` how did it get so bad ? how did we get here ? '' ''
really ?
the problems we have as a country are the problems we created as a country .
otherwise , we should call it what it really is : poverty insurance .
on a mezzo level : historically speaking , the education of the black and brown child has always depended on the philanthropy of others .
if your son or daughter or niece or nephew or neighbor or little timmy down the street goes to an affluent school , challenge your school committee to adopt an impoverished school or an impoverished classroom .
close the divide by engaging in communication and relationships that matter .
when resources are shared , they 're not divided ; they 're multiplied .
and on a micro level : if you 're a human being , donate .
there are websites like donorschoose that recognize the disparity and actually want to do something about it .
what is a carpenter with no tools ?
there 's a certain style of parenting these days that 's getting in the way .
first of all , there 's no time for free play .
and they see in our faces that our approval , that our love , that their very worth , comes from a 's .
well , we parents , we parents are pretty sure it 's all worth it .
but really , here 's why .
the longest longitudinal study of humans ever conducted is called the harvard grant study .
all right , so you 're thinking , chores and love , that sounds all well and good , but give me a break .
i 've got two kids i mentioned , sawyer and avery .
thank you .
i am a chef and a food policy guy , but i come from a whole family of teachers .
my father just retired after 25 years teaching fifth grade .
my aunt and uncle were professors .
my cousins all teach .
they taught me that the only way to get the right answers is to ask the right questions .
so what are the right questions when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for our children ?
there 's obviously many important questions , but i think the following is a good place to start : what do we think the connection is between a child 's growing mind and their growing body ?
what can they possibly learn if their bodies are literally going hungry ?
and with all the resources that we are pouring into schools , we should stop and ask ourselves : are we really setting our kids up for success ?
`` now , a few years ago , i was a judge on a cooking competition called `` '' chopped . '' '' four chefs compete with mystery ingredients to see who can cook the best dishes . ''
in this episode , the main-course mystery ingredient was quinoa .
but the dish that i will never forget was cooked by a woman named cheryl barbara .
cheryl was the nutrition director at high school in the community in connecticut .
it was amazing .
it was a pappardelle with italian sausage , kale , parmesan cheese .
it was delicious , like , restaurant-quality good , except — she basically just threw the quinoa , pretty much uncooked , into the dish .
( laughter ) so i took on the tv accusatory judge thing that you 're supposed to do , and i asked her why she did that .
`` cheryl responded , `` '' well , first , i do n't know what quinoa is . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' but i do know that it 's a monday , and that in my school , at high school in the community , i always cook pasta . '' '' see , cheryl explained that for many of her kids , there were no meals on the weekends . ''
no meals on saturday .
no meals on sunday , either .
so she cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure she cooked something she knew her children would eat .
something that would stick to their ribs , she said .
something that would fill them up .
the only thing .
meet allison .
she 's 12 years old , she 's smart as a whip and she wants to be a physicist when she grows up .
if allison goes to a school that serves a nutritious breakfast to all of their kids , here 's what 's going to follow .
allison will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid .
she 'll have better attendance , and she 'll show up on time more often .
why ?
well , because there 's a good meal waiting for her at school .
overall , allison is in much better health than the average school kid .
well , meet tommy .
he 's also 12. he 's a wonderful kid .
by the time he 's in third grade , he 's got lower math and reading scores .
by the time he 's 11 , it 's more likely that tommy will have to have repeated a grade .
so how widespread is this problem ?
well , unfortunately , it 's pervasive .
let me give you two stats that seem like they 're on opposite ends of the issue , but are actually two sides of the same coin .
it 's crazy .
on the other hand , diet and nutrition is the number one cause of preventable death and disease in this country , by far .
so they fill up on the unhealthy and cheap calories that surround them in their communities and that their families can afford .
but then by the end of the month , food stamps run out or hours get cut at work , and they do n't have the money to cover the basic cost of food .
but we should be able to solve this problem , right ?
we know what the answers are .
for free .
so what happened ?
when we give our kids the nourishment they need ,
now , you do n't have to trust me on this , but you should talk to donna martin .
i love donna martin .
a few years ago , donna decided to get out ahead of the new standards that were coming , and overhaul her nutrition standards .
she improved and added fruit and vegetables and whole grains .
she served breakfast in the classroom to all of her kids .
and she implemented a dinner program .
why ?
so how did they respond ?
but donna 's biggest supporter came from an unexpected place .
now , coach parker had coached mediocre teams for years .
but the year donna changed the menus , the bears not only won their division , they went on to win the state championship , beating the peach county trojans 28-14 .
and it 's not just up to the cheryl barbaras and the donna martins of the world .
and feeding our kids the basic nutrition is just the starting point .
what i 've laid out is really a model for so many of the most pressing issues that we face .
food is that place where our collective efforts can have the greatest impact .
so we have to ask ourselves : what is the right question ?
what would happen if we fed ourselves more nutritious , more sustainably grown food ?
( applause )
we all know trust is fundamental , but when it comes to trusting people , something profound is happening .
social profiles and reviews help people make a choice .
but it turns out that the key social identifier is how much you 're going to talk in the car .
it 's remarkable , right , that this idea works at all , because it 's counter to the lesson most of us were taught as a child : never get in a car with a stranger .
ok. i want you to close your eyes .
for you to leap from a place of certainty , to take a chance on that someone or something unknown , you need a force to pull you over the gap , and that remarkable force is trust .
trust is an elusive concept , and yet we depend on it for our lives to function .
there are , in fact , hundreds of definitions of trust , and most can be reduced to some kind of risk assessment of how likely it is that things will go right .
but i do n't like this definition of trust , because it makes trust sound rational and predictable , and it does n't really get to the human essence of what it enables us to do and how it empowers us to connect with other people .
so i define trust a little differently .
that 's a trust leap .
does trust transfer ?
on the first level , you have to trust the idea .
the second level is about having confidence in the platform , that blablacar will help you if something goes wrong .
and the third level is about using little bits of information to decide whether the other person is trustworthy .
in other words , trust enables change and innovation .
it 's widely talked about how trust in institutions and many corporate brands has been steadily declining and continues to do so .
conventions of how trust is built , managed , lost and repaired — in brands , leaders and entire systems — is being turned upside down .
now , this is exciting , but it 's frightening , because it forces many of us to have to rethink how trust is built and destroyed with our customers , with our employees , even our loved ones .
the other day , i was talking to the ceo of a leading international hotel brand , and as is often the case , we got onto the topic of airbnb .
he was perplexed at how a company that depends on the willingness of strangers to trust one another could work so well across 191 countries .
and the reason why i would never do this as a guest on airbnb is because guests know that they 'll be rated by hosts , and that those ratings are likely to impact their ability to transact in the future .
trust is no longer top-down .
it 's being unbundled and inverted .
and this shift is only going to accelerate with the emergence of the blockchain , the innovative ledger technology underpinning bitcoin .
the easiest way i can describe it is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets , and they are filled with assets .
so that could be a property title .
it could be a stock trade .
every day , five million people will take a trust leap and ride with uber .
that 's 127 rides per second , showing that this is a cross-cultural phenomenon .
we share our homes with people we do not know .
thank you very much .
so this is my niece .
her name is yahli .
over the past few years , we have made dramatic breakthroughs .
machine learning is now capable of far , far more complex tasks .
now , this is a particularly remarkable example of creativity .
so what does this mean for the future of work ?
on frequent , high-volume tasks , machines are getting smarter and smarter .
if it does , then you will stay ahead of the machines .
thank you .
this was like the democratization of justice .
power shifts fast .
it 's about a woman called justine sacco .
`` and then another message from a best friend , `` '' you need to call me right now . ''
a few weeks later , i talked to the gawker journalist .
did justine 's joke overwhelm your twitter feed the way it did mine ?
and then justine 's employers got involved : [ iac on @ justinesacco tweet : this is an outrageous , offensive comment .
but it was worse than that .
she was losing herself .
and of course , that 's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for , like having children out of wedlock .
[ let us not be fooled by # justinesacco her father is a sa mining billionaire .
jon ronson : thanks , bruno .
and i assume you did n't only have friendly reactions on twitter .
but yeah , for 30 years i 've been writing stories about abuses of power , and when i say the powerful people over there in the military , or in the pharmaceutical industry , everybody applauds me .
anyways , we thought it was going to affect all parts of science and technology , from computing to medicine .
and the reason is , these nanomaterials — they 're like a double-edged sword .
we 've built entire economies on this idea .
so there we have it .
`` at this point , we said , `` '' let 's just stop . ''
we ca n't do it for them . they have to do it for themselves .
and it 's the hard way , and this is not trivial , but in this case , it 's the only way .
now , as it turns out , this is not that alien of a problem .
we just do n't build anything this way .
and she 's already at the nano .
that 's exactly what we 've done in our lab .
now , computing is just one example .
why change it if it works ?
( applause )
it 's not harmful ; it has just repaired the muscle .
we do n't want to do that to our students .
they cause different things to happen inside the cell .
i do n't give a damn about the revolution .
this is all adding up to a decrease in freedom across the world .
from the city of raqqa in syria , people like ruqia hassan and naji jerf have been assassinated for their reporting out of isis-controlled territory .
the problem is their enforcement mechanisms are a complete black box , and there is collateral damage .
take , for example , iyad el-baghdadi , an activist who makes fun of isis on twitter .
but that 's the thing — she had to get media attention .
so with these companies having so much power over the public discourse , they need to be held accountable .
my name is joshua walters .
i 'm a performer .
i reframe that as a positive because the crazier i get onstage , the more entertaining i become .
when i was 16 in san francisco , i had my breakthrough manic episode in which i thought i was jesus christ .
maybe you thought that was scary , but actually there 's no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you 're jesus christ .
( laughter ) i was sent to a place , a psych ward , and in the psych ward , everyone is doing their own one-man show . ( laughter )
they 're just practicing .
now when i got out , i was diagnosed and i was given medications by a psychiatrist .
`` `` '' okay , josh , why do n't we give you some — why do n't we give you some zyprexa . ''
okay ? mmhmm ?
i can feel your noise .
the second half was just one big nap , pretty much , in class .
when i got out i had a choice .
( bugle sound ) there 's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive — at least the hypomanic edge part of it .
you 're driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible .
and there 's a book — john gartner .
some of them committed suicide .
so it was n't all the good side of the illness .
now recently , there 's been development in this field .
just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum — you know what i 'm talking about — not maybe full bipolar , but they 're in the bipolar spectrum — where on one side , maybe you think you 're jesus , and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money .
everyone 's somewhere in the middle .
so maybe , you know , there 's no such thing as crazy , and being diagnosed with a mental illness does n't mean you 're crazy .
but maybe it just means you 're more sensitive to what most people ca n't see or feel .
depends on how lucky you are .
( applause )
when i was 19 , i dropped out of college — dropped out , kicked out , splitting hairs .
something was wrong .
it stems from a lifelong interest of mine in , believe it or not , poverty .
that 's not even close .
it was a picture in the national geographic magazine of a kid who was my age in east africa , and there were flies on his face and a distended belly .
and i wondered , what happened to that kid ?
but here 's the truth .
that 's something we ought to celebrate .
and here it is .
here are the reasons .
number four : rule of law .
but that is great .
it sounds like milton friedman or ronald reagan .
wrong .
why do i know it by heart ?
crazy .
it 's unpleasant . it 's not right .
it 's common in world conflict .
think about it . think about it .
well , first , let 's be honest : there are differences .
let 's not minimize the differences . that would be really naïve .
there 's a lot of good research on this .
a veteran of the ted stage is my friend jonathan haidt .
he 's a psychology professor at new york university .
he does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ .
irreconcilable differences , right ?
that is diversity in which lies our strength .
it 's a tricky thing , is n't it .
we need investment overseas in a sustainable , responsible , ethical and moral way . yes . yes .
but you know what we really need ?
do n't we ?
do you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable ?
kinda conventional ?
do you ever feel like you 're always listening to people who agree with you ?
why is that dangerous ?
so how are we going to do it ? how are we going to do it together ?
when people hear us , with the kind of unpredictable ideology , then maybe people will listen .
and then maybe , just maybe , we 'll all realize that our big differences are n't really that big after all .
well , i thought there would be a podium , so i 'm a bit scared .
most people believed it was proteins .
this is someone selling this on ebay ; it was clearly a woman’s hand , hopefully a woman 's hand .
this is where it gets weird .
fred sexton was a friend of this guy , george hodel .
and that is how un-typical this place is .
now , i 'm a physicist , but i 'm not the right kind of physicist .
because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones .
where 's the cure for schizophrenia ?
where 's the cure for insomnia ?
this is a frontline treatment for hypertension .
this is not an acceptable way of doing business .
here 's why .
these are , in fact , different tribes .
it 's called human safaris .
this is a picture of actual contact .
let 's make a better world .
seriously , but dangerously fun .
but curiosity , exploration , are part of the play scene .
these lionesses , seen from a distance , looked like they were fighting .
and you can trust it .
we 're about two and a half , three months into it , and it 's really been fun .
( applause )
laptops are a luxury ; it 's like giving them ipods . no .
and think of the laptop as a vaccine .
millions of people living here , stretched over many kilometers .
most of our education system is push .
well , the key is motivation , and there are two aspects to it .
yet , everyone knows what is a chinese restaurant .
most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools .
it will lay waste to appetite . it will lay waste to social confidence .
`` he called out one word in the darkness : `` bye . '' ''
it was april 20 , 1999 .
`` what kind of a mother were you ? '' '' i still ask myself those same questions . ''
all i can do is share what i have learned .
when i talk to people who did n't know me before the shootings , i have three challenges to meet .
first , when i walk into a room like this , i never know if someone there has experienced loss because of what my son did .
so first , with all of my heart , i 'm sorry if my son has caused you pain .
if estimates are correct that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person , when suicide rates rise , as they are rising for some populations , the murder-suicide rates will rise as well .
i wanted to understand what was going on in dylan 's mind prior to his death , so i looked for answers from other survivors of suicide loss .
later , when she found me alone , she apologized for overhearing that conversation , but told me that i was wrong .
she said that when she was a young , single mother with three small children , she became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe .
even though they can make a plan and act with logic , their sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain through which they interpret their reality .
but my son 's death was not purely a suicide .
it involved mass murder .
i wanted to know how his suicidal thinking became homicidal .
but research is sparse and there are no simple answers .
yes , he probably had ongoing depression .
it was appallingly easy for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns , both legally and illegally , without my permission or knowledge .
two years after the shootings , i got breast cancer , and two years after that , i began to have mental health problems .
i was afraid to turn on the news , afraid to hear myself being called a terrible parent or a disgusting person .
both episodes lasted several weeks .
`` every time someone asks me , `` '' how could you not have known ? `` `` , it feels like a punch in the gut . ''
it carries accusation and taps into my feelings of guilt that no matter how much therapy i 've had i will never fully eradicate .
we should listen with our whole being , without judgments , and without offering solutions .
i know that i will live with this tragedy , with these multiple tragedies , for the rest of my life .
i know there are even some who think i do n't have the right to any pain , but only to a life of permanent penance .
in the end what i know comes down to this : the tragic fact is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us may not be able to help , but for love 's sake , we must never stop trying to know the unknowable .
thank you .
i love being a police officer because it 's always been a calling for me and never a job .
you know what ?
i was just so tired .
i was tired of the vicious cycle , and i was tired of it even in the beloved agency in the department that i still love today .
and so my wife and i , we sat down and we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire .
there was a love for the city that i loved , that i grew up in , that i was educated in — a city that pulled my heart back into the system .
i had to start listening to that man on the inside that went against everything that i had been trained to do .
we had to change it .
so i met them and i began to listen .
`` we said , `` '' this is your community table . ''
but we have exercised that arm so much , so very much .
it looks sickly .
but we forgot to treat our communities like they 're our customers ; like they 're our sons and daughters , our brothers and sisters , our mothers and fathers .
it 's even harder to make a change .
everybody makes up a community .
too much .
but we have surrendered so much of our responsibility .
it was those guardians , it was that village mentality .
`` they came and said , `` '' stop that ! '' '' and `` '' do this . '' '' and `` '' stop that . '' '' we had mentors throughout all of the community . ''
we 've lost it with one another .
we all take responsibility in this .
you see , after three years
it would take care of itself .
`` whatcha doin ' ? we got ta get some of that ! '' '' ( laughter ) and so we gave them some of that . ''
the uprising still hurts .
this nation will become great again .
because we have the same goal : we all want peace .
here , you can see men went eight years .
yes , yes , yes , women have almost caught up .
so this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle .
it was good in evolution .
it was supposed to be our strength , was n't it ?
imagine a long list with , say , 250 facts .
that will help you score better on our tests .
if something , yes , this is a good one , sharks are dangerous .
that 's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing , a better life for people .
and what i 'm so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in asia , in the middle east , in latin america and east europe that [ are ] reducing with this rate .
so there 's good news .
`` but then i hear people saying , `` '' there is no progress in africa . ''
come with me to the wonderful world of statistics .
here you see the data .
do n't panic — do n't panic now , i 'll help you through this .
it looks nasty , like in college when you did n't like statistics .
but first thing , when you see dots like this , you have to ask yourself : from where do the data come ?
what is the origin of the data ?
and this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about [ her ] birth history .
so this is a limitation .
this was 1977 , 1988 , 1992 , '97 and 2002 .
but watch out — they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing .
and they estimated that in 2008 , kenya had per child mortality of 128 .
i was so happy .
then it just took another three months for [ the ] u.n. to get it into their server , and on friday we got the new trend line — it was down here .
is n't it nice — is n't it nice , yeah ?
they start [ in ] 1990 — they measure to 2009 .
as a professor , i think i have the right to propose something differently .
they have 2.4 percent .
it 's coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring mdgs .
and the reason here for africa is especially important , because '90s was a bad decade , not only in kenya , but across africa .
the hiv epidemic peaked .
now this sounds a little theoretical , but it 's not so theoretical .
you know , these economists , they love money , they want more and more of it , they want it to grow .
in the 90s , only 1.2 percent , only 1.2 percent .
still here , child death per 1,000 on that axis .
here we have [ the ] year .
and i 'm now giving you a wider picture than the mdg .
but then , in the '80s , watch out here .
ghana got very ahead , fast .
that 's where we are today .
you can see it does n't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement .
their countries are so different , and they merit to be recognized in the same way , as we do n't talk about europe as one place .
my country , sweden : 1800 , we were up there .
it 's not about just five years — it 's long-term investments .
so we are off track — that 's what sweden is .
but you do n't talk about it so much .
we want others to be better than we were , and indeed , others have been better .
here we have a problem .
we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill .
and the size of the bubble is the population .
`` and these are the so-called `` '' developing '' '' countries . ''
they had high , or very high , child mortality and family size , six to eight .
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in .
`` it 's very good — `` '' levels and trends in child mortality '' '' — except this page . ''
they get samsung , how can they be [ a ] developing country ?
they have here singapore .
they have the lowest child mortality in the world , singapore .
what is the importance now with the relations here .
look — even if we look in africa — these are the african countries .
it 's very clear that this is what happens .
and a very important piece of research came out on friday from the institute of health metrics and evaluation in seattle showing that almost 50 percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education .
that 's why we must have that long-term perspective , but we must measure the impact over 10-year periods .
it 's a decent life for children , we are talking about .
and that is fully possible . let 's do it .
it 's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what 's on their bookshelves .
and when i thought about it , it seemed like a real shame .
i knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there by writers working in languages other than english .
so , i decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading .
although , the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher .
having spent my life reading almost exclusively british and north american books , i had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world .
i could n't tell you how to source a story from swaziland .
i would n't know a good novel from namibia .
so how on earth was i going to read the world ?
at first , it was friends and colleagues .
then it was friends of friends .
and pretty soon , it was strangers .
she said she loved the sound of my project , could she go to her local english-language bookshop and choose my malaysian book and post it to me ?
books often came from surprising sources .
my panamanian read , for example , came through a conversation i had with the panama canal on twitter .
i found morgan 's website and i sent him a message , asking if any of his spanish-language novels had been translated into english .
morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way .
( laughter ) and i read about an orgy in a tree in angola .
but perhaps the most amazing example of the lengths that people were prepared to go to to help me read the world , came towards the end of my quest , when i tried to get hold of a book from the tiny , portuguese-speaking african island nation of são tomé and príncipe .
and i sent a copy out to each of my volunteers .
when it came to são tomé and príncipe , it was a chance not only to learn something new and discover a new collection of stories , but also to bring together a group of people and facilitate a joint creative endeavor .
the books i read that year opened my eyes to many things .
wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking .
but cumulatively , the stories i read that year made me more alive than ever before to the richness , diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet .
it was as though the world 's stories and the people who 'd gone to such lengths to help me read them had made it real to me .
it 's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together .
i hope it 's a story i 'm reading for many years to come .
so what i 'm going to do is play this .
ryan holladay : blend seamlessly .
it leaves the listener feeling sickly .
my talk today is about something maybe a couple of you have already heard about .
anyone heard of it ?
( applause ) so in 2011 , power shifted , from the few to the many , from oval offices to central squares , from carefully guarded airwaves to open-source networks .
i study muslim societies around the world at gallup .
since 2001 , we 've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people — young and old , men and women , educated and illiterate .
but those who revolted shared a common set of grievances and have similar demands today .
i 'm going to focus a lot of my talk on egypt .
it has nothing to do with the fact that i was born there , of course .
but it 's the largest arab country and it 's also one with a great deal of influence .
but i 'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region to look at the mundane topics of arab views of religion and politics and how this impacts women , revealing some surprises along the way .
to tell you what i mean , consider this trend in egypt .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
in 2010 , right before the revolution , even though gdp per capita had been growing at five percent for several years , egyptians had never felt worse about their lives .
now this is very unusual , because globally we find that , not surprisingly , people feel better as their country gets richer .
and that 's because they have better job opportunities and their state offers better social services .
but it was n't just anger at economic injustice .
as early as 2001 , we asked arabs , and muslims in general around the world , what they admired most about the west .
among the most frequent responses was liberty and justice .
`` in their own words to an open-ended question we heard , `` '' their political system is transparent and it 's following democracy in its true sense . '' '' another said it was `` '' liberty and freedom and being open-minded with each other . '' '' majorities as high as 90 percent and greater in egypt , indonesia and iran told us in 2005 that if they were to write a new constitution for a theoretical new country that they would guarantee freedom of speech as a fundamental right , especially in egypt . ''
so rather than viewing their former regimes as generous if overprotective fathers , they viewed them as essentially prison wardens .
if egypt is to succeed at building a society based on the rule of law , it could be a model .
islamists , not the young liberals that sparked the revolution , won the majority in parliament .
and what really struck me about them was that they were n't only optimistic , but they kind of struck me as nervous , for lack of a better word .
`` one said to me , `` '' our people used to gather in cafes to watch football '' '' — or soccer , as we say in america — `` and now they gather to watch parliament . '' ''
`` ( laughter ) `` '' they 're really watching us , and we ca n't help but worry that we 're not going to live up to their expectations . '' '' and what really struck me is that less than 24 months ago , it was the people that were nervous about being watched by their government . ''
and the reason that they 're expecting a lot is because they have a new-found hope for the future .
it actually got harder .
but people 's expectations for their future went up significantly .
the egyptian people , and many other arabs who 've revolted and are in transition , have very high expectations of the government .
they 're just victims of a long-time autocracy , expecting a paternal state to solve all their problems .
( applause ) and three-fourths believe they not only have the responsibility , but the power to make change .
( applause ) now people have raised some real concerns about what the rise of islamist parties means for women .
what we 've found about the role of religion in law and the role of religion in society is that there 's no female consensus .
because we discovered a link between men 's support for women 's employment and how many women are actually employed in professional fields in that country .
so the question becomes , what drives men 's support for women 's rights ?
what about men 's views of religion and law ?
[ does ] a man 's opinion of the role of religion in politics shape their view of women 's rights ?
what drives men 's support for women 's employment is men 's employment , their level of education as well as a high score on their country 's u.n. human development index .
what this means is that human development , not secularization , is what 's key to women 's empowerment in the transforming middle east .
from wall street to mohammed mahmoud street , it has never been more important to understand the aspirations of ordinary people .
thank you .
( applause )
i 've spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals .
i might have ended up spending most of my life on the back ward of a hospital , but that is n't how my life turned out .
in fact , i 've managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades , perhaps my proudest accomplishment .
that 's not to say that i 've remained clear of all psychiatric struggles .
after i graduated from the yale law school and got my first law job , my new haven analyst , dr. white , announced to me that he was going to close his practice in three months , several years before i had planned to leave new haven .
white had been enormously helpful to me , and the thought of his leaving shattered me .
my best friend steve , sensing that something was terribly wrong , flew out to new haven to be with me .
`` now i 'm going to quote from some of my writings : `` '' i opened the door to my studio apartment . ''
my face looked and felt like a mask .
'thank you for coming , steve .
tell the clocks to stop .
time is . time has come . ' 'white is leaving , ' steve said somberly .
'gravity is pulling me down .
`` i 'm scared . tell them to get away . ' '' '' as a young woman , i was in a psychiatric hospital on three different occasions for lengthy periods . ''
( applause ) thank you .
i 'd like to share with you how that happened , and also describe my experience of being psychotic .
i hasten to add that it 's my experience , because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way .
let 's start with the definition of schizophrenia .
its defining feature is psychosis , or being out of touch with reality .
for example , when i 'm psychotic i often have the delusion that i 've killed hundreds of thousands of people with my thoughts .
i sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain .
imagine having a nightmare while you 're awake .
often , speech and thinking become disorganized to the point of incoherence .
`` loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but do n't make sense , and if the words get jumbled up enough , it 's called `` '' word salad . '' '' contrary to what many people think , schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality . ''
everyone has seen a street person , unkempt , probably ill-fed , standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting .
but schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array of socioeconomic status , and there are people with the illness who are full-time professionals with major responsibilities .
several years ago , i decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey , and i want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view .
'they make certain points . the point is on your head .
'what are you talking about , elyn ? ' 'oh , you know , the usual . who 's what , what 's who , heaven and hell . let 's go out on the roof .
it 's a flat surface . it 's safe . ' rebel and val followed and they asked what had gotten into me .
and then , late on a friday night , on the roof of the yale law school , i began to sing , and not quietly either .
come to the florida sunshine bush , where there are lemons , where they make demons . ' 'you 're frightening me , ' one of them said , and rebel and val headed back into the library .
back inside , i asked my classmates if they were having the same experience of words jumping around our cases as i was .
'we 've got to case the joint .
my head was too full of noise , too full of orange trees and law memos i could not write and mass murders i knew i would be responsible for .
`` continuing with the writings : `` '' the next morning i went to my professor 's office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment , and i began gibbering unintelligably as i had the night before , and he eventually brought me to the emergency room . ''
then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed with thick leather straps .
a sound came out of my mouth that i 'd never heard before : half groan , half scream , barely human and pure terror .
to support this view , they wrote in my chart that i was unable to do my yale law school homework .
i wondered what that meant about much of the rest of new haven .
( laughter ) during the next year , i would spend five months in a psychiatric hospital .
i never struck anyone .
i never harmed anyone . i never made any direct threats .
there 's nothing benign about it .
while i was preparing to write my student note for the yale law journal on mechanical restraints , i consulted an eminent law professor who was also a psychiatrist , and said surely he would agree that restraints must be degrading , painful and frightening .
they 're different from me and you .
we do n't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would .
in fact , until very recently , and i 'm sure some people still hold it as a view , that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe .
today , i 'd like to say i 'm very pro-psychiatry but very anti-force .
i do n't think force is effective as treatment , and i think using force is a terrible thing to do to another person with a terrible illness .
eventually , i came to los angeles to teach at the university of southern california law school .
for years , i had resisted medication , making many , many efforts to get off .
i felt that if i could manage without medication , i could prove that , after all , i was n't really mentally ill , it was some terrible mistake .
my motto was the less medicine , the less defective .
`` quoting from the text : `` '' i started the reduction of my meds , and within a short time i began feeling the effects . ''
all around me i sensed evil beings poised with daggers .
they 'd slice me up in thin slices or make me swallow hot coals .
kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony . ' even in this state , what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic , i refused to take more medication .
he was under the impression that i had a mild psychotic illness .
is it okay if i totally trash your office ? ' 'you need to leave if you think you 're going to do that , ' said marder .
'okay . small . fire on ice . tell them not to kill me .
tell them not to kill me . what have i done wrong ?
i think you need to be in the hospital .
you 're offering to put me in hospitals ?
`` one must stay away . i 'm god , or i used to be . ' '' '' at that point in the text , where i said `` '' i 'm god , or i used to be , '' '' my husband made a marginal note . ''
`` he said , `` '' did you quit or were you fired ? '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' 'i give life and i take it away . ''
forgive me , for i know not what i do . ' eventually , i broke down in front of friends , and everybody convinced me to take more medication .
four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy for decades and continuing , and excellent psychopharmacology .
these relationships have given my life a meaning and a depth , and they also helped me navigate my life in the face of symptoms .
it 's also a very intellectually stimulating place , and occupying my mind with complex problems has been my best and most powerful and most reliable defense against my mental illness .
even with all that — excellent treatment , wonderful family and friends , supportive work environment — i did not make my illness public until relatively late in life , and that 's because the stigma against mental illness is so powerful that i did n't feel safe with people knowing .
the better we understand these illnesses , the better the treatments we can provide , and the better the treatments we can provide , the more we can offer people care , and not have to use force .
i could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself .
a message to the entertainment industry and to the press : on the whole , you 've done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds .
please , continue to let us see characters in your movies , your plays , your columns , who suffer with severe mental illness .
portray them sympathetically , and portray them in all the richness and depth of their experience as people and not as diagnoses .
recently , a friend posed a question : if there were a pill i could take that would instantly cure me , would i take it ?
the poet rainer maria rilke was offered psychoanalysis .
`` he declined , saying , `` '' do n't take my devils away , because my angels may flee too . '' '' my psychosis , on the other hand , is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled . ''
so would i take the pill ? in an instant .
that said , i do n't wish to be seen as regretting the life i could have had if i 'd not been mentally ill , nor am i asking anyone for their pity .
so basically , please do n't go and download any of the viruses that i show you .
it 's a pretty accurate description .
so today , computer viruses and trojans , designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your webcam to the theft of billions of dollars .
some malicious code today goes as far as targeting power , utilities and infrastructure .
let me give you a quick snapshot of what malicious code is capable of today .
right now , every second , eight new users are joining the internet .
today , we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses .
and , just to kind of tear down a myth here , lots of people think that when you get infected with a computer virus , it 's because you went to a porn site .
right ? well , actually , statistically speaking , if you only visit porn sites , you 're safer .
well , many of you have the image , do n't you , of the spotty teenager sitting in a basement , hacking away for notoriety .
in fact , they have product adverts .
you can go online and buy a hacking service to knock your business competitor offline .
check out this one i found .
( video ) man : so you 're here for one reason , and that reason is because you need your business competitors , rivals , haters , or whatever the reason is , or who , they are to go down .
well you , my friend , you 've came to the right place .
if you want your business competitors to go down , well , they can .
if you want your rivals to go offline , well , they will .
james lyne : now , i did actually pay one of these cybercriminals to attack my own website .
things got a bit tricky when i tried to expense it at the company .
but regardless , it 's amazing how many products and services are available now to cybercriminals .
but it goes further .
it comes with technical installation guides , video setup routines , and get this , technical support .
you can email the cybercriminals and they 'll tell you how to set up your illegal hacking server .
so let me show you what malicious code looks like today .
what i 've got here is two systems , an attacker , which i 've made look all matrix-y and scary , and a victim , which you might recognize from home or work .
`` maybe some of you have received an email that says something like , `` '' hi , i 'm a nigerian banker , and i 'd like to give you 53 billion dollars because i like your face . '' '' or funnycats.exe , which rumor has it was quite successful in china 's recent campaign against america . ''
now there are many ways you can get infected .
now how do you get a usb key to run in a business ?
well , you could try looking really cute .
awww .
or , in my case , awkward and pathetic .
so imagine this scenario : i walk into one of your businesses , looking very awkward and pathetic , with a copy of my c.v .
what i 'm going to do is plug in the usb key .
this would , of course , normally happen in a couple of seconds , really , really quickly , but i 've kind of slowed it down so you can actually see the attack occurring .
malware is very boring otherwise .
so this is writing out the malicious code , and a few seconds later , on the left-hand side , you 'll see the attacker 's screen get some interesting new text .
now if i place the mouse cursor over it , this is what we call a command prompt , and using this we can navigate around the computer .
we can access your documents , your data .
you can turn on the webcam .
that can be very embarrassing .
or just to really prove a point , we can launch programs like my personal favorite , the windows calculator .
it 's a terrible website . it 's got really awful graphics .
and it 's got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website .
this is a script .
it 's code which will be interpreted on the webpage .
that website address at the top there , which you can just about see , microshaft.com , the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs , and up pops fake antivirus .
it creates some very serious alerts .
oh look , a child porn proxy server .
what 's really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data , but when the scan finishes , they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses , you have to register the product .
( laughter ) people now pay cybercriminals money to run viruses , which i find utterly bizarre .
chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day is a massive challenge , and those numbers are only growing directly in proportion to the length of my stress line , you 'll note here .
so i want to talk to you briefly about a group of hackers we tracked for a year and actually found — and this is a rare treat in our job .
now this was a cross-industry collaboration , people from facebook , independent researchers , guys from sophos .
what this would do is send the cybercriminals a text message every day telling them how much money they 'd made that day , so a kind of cybercriminal billings report , if you will .
now that 's obviously interesting , because that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals .
`` down below , highlighted in red , in the other section of source code , is this bit `` '' leded : leded . '' '' that 's a username , kind of like you might have on twitter . ''
lots of you here will use smartphones to take photos and post them from the conference .
in fact , i 've been spending a lot of time on internet dating sites recently , obviously for research purposes , and i 've noticed that about 60 percent of the profile pictures on internet dating sites contain the gps coordinates of where the photo was taken , which is kind of scary because you would n't give out your home address to lots of strangers , but we 're happy to give away our gps coordinates to plus or minus 15 meters .
and our cybercriminals had done the same thing .
we then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool .
using the email address , the telephone number and the gps data , on the left you see an advert for a bmw that one of our cybercriminals is selling , on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens .
one of these was more stereotypical for me .
imagine , these are hardened cybercriminals sharing information scarcely .
but this is where our investigation starts to slow down .
our friends , our families and our colleagues can break our security even when we do the right things .
this is mobsoft , one of the companies that this cybercriminal gang owned , and an interesting thing about mobsoft is the 50-percent owner of this posted a job advert , and this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers from the code earlier .
and it 's kind of like she went into her social media settings and clicked on every option imaginable to make herself really , really insecure .
by the end of the investigation , where you can read the full 27-page report at that link , we had photos of the cybercriminals , even the office christmas party when they were out on an outing .
that 's right , cybercriminals do have christmas parties , as it turns out .
i want to change pace to one last little demonstration , a technique that is wonderfully simple and basic , but is interesting in exposing how much information we 're all giving away , and it 's relevant because it applies to us as a ted audience .
many of you all know about the concept of scanning for wireless networks .
you do it every time you take out your iphone or your blackberry and connect to something like tedattendees .
but what you might not know is that you 're also beaming out a list of networks you 've previously connected to , even when you 're not using wireless actively .
so i ran a little scan .
okay ? so you can see a list of wireless networks .
tedattendees , hyattlb . where do you think i 'm staying ?
sophos_visitors , sansemea , companies i work with .
ciasurveillancevan .
we called it that at one of our conferences because we thought that would freak people out , which is quite fun .
this is how geeks party .
so let 's make this a little bit more interesting .
twenty-three percent of you have been to starbucks recently and used the wireless network .
your wireless network name is so unique that i was able to pinpoint it using data available openly on the internet with no hacking or clever , clever tricks .
`` and i should mention as well that some of you do use your names , `` '' james lyne 's iphone , '' '' for example . ''
you see , technology 's changing at a staggering rate , and that 250,000 pieces of malware wo n't stay the same for long .
there 's a very concerning trend that whilst many people coming out of schools now are much more technology-savvy , they know how to use technology , fewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects to know how that technology works under the covers .
most laws are national in their implementation , despite cybercrime conventions , where the internet is borderless and international by definition .
you 're going to read about malware doing incredible and terrifying , scary things .
however , 99 percent of it works because people fail to do the basics .
get a secure password .
make sure you use a different password on each of your sites and services online .
the internet is a fantastic resource for business , for political expression , for art and for learning .
but it 's not just what he stood for , it 's what his message was .
you know , as an anthropologist , walking is what made us human .
we live in one of the biggest prisons in the world .
when it 's cold , we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes .
sometimes we make food , too .
but like me , they are human beings .
and guess what ?
so , no male journalists get the story .
i have a wonderful husband , a wonderful husband who supports me despite all the criticism he gets from the society .
the journalist covering the story and i were asked to meet outside of his hotel .
so , why do i do what i do ?
there have been several close calls .
this is the jaw-dropper .
( applause )
and this is yuyu , who is a dancer i have been working with .
yr : needless to say , i would like to apologize to any mandarin speakers in the audience .
my dad never wore it , so i did n't see why i had to .
also , it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable , that people assume i represent something genuinely indian when i wear it , because that 's not how i feel .
`` hp : ( in chinese ) yr : actually , the only way i feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like li mu bai from that film , `` crouching tiger , hidden dragon . '' ''
( music ) okay .
hp : ( in chinese ) yr : i used to read spider-man comics , watch kung fu movies , take philosophy lessons from bruce lee .
he would say things like — hp : empty your mind .
( laughter ) be formless , shapeless , like water .
you put water into a bottle , it becomes the bottle .
put it in a teapot , it becomes the teapot .
now , water can flow or it can crash .
( laughter ) yr : good advice , but i still think that we learn who we are by copying others .
i have .
hp : a few years ago , in order to make this video for my artwork , i shaved off all my hair so that i could grow it back as my father had it when he first emigrated from india to the u.k. in the 1960s .
at first , it was going very well .
i even started to get discounts in indian shops .
it did n't look indian anymore .
instead , people from across the road , they would shout things like — hp and yr : arriba ! arriba ! ándale ! ándale !
my dad does n't even have an indian accent anymore .
he talks like this now .
`` i spoke the phrase , and then he laughed and told me , `` '' oh yeah , that 's great , only it kind of sounds like a woman . '' '' i said , `` '' what ? '' '' he said , `` '' yeah , you learned from a woman ? '' '' i said , `` '' yes . so ? '' '' he then explained the tonal differences between male and female voices are very different and distinct , and that i had learned it very well , but in a woman 's voice . ''
( laughter ) ( applause ) hp : okay . so this imitation business does come with risk .
it does n't always go as you plan it , even with a talented translator .
but i am going to stick with it , because contrary to what we might usually assume , imitating somebody can reveal something unique .
so every time i fail to become more like my father , i become more like myself .
this is my art .
i strive for authenticity , even if it comes in a shape that we might not usually expect .
it 's only recently that i 've started to understand that i did n't learn to sit like this through being indian .
and for some reason that day , instead , i asked myself a question , and it was , where does this stuff go ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) but that day , when i asked that question , i learned something , and that was that i 'd grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right , when in fact it 's a privilege .
they do n't have a bucket or a box .
and they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the mumbai airport expressway , which is called open defecation , or poo-pooing in the open .
but he should , because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers .
he 's barefoot . he 'll run back into his house , and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet .
where i come from , we call it delhi belly , as a legacy of empire .
but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency , this is the picture that you come up with .
this is marie saylee , nine months old .
you ca n't see her , because she 's buried under that green grass in a little village in liberia , because she died in three days from diarrhea — the hershey squirts , the runs , a joke .
diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide , and you 've probably been asked to care about things like hiv/aids or t.b . or measles , but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together .
it 's a wonderful waste disposal device .
shit offends people . feces is too medical .
because i ca n't explain otherwise , when i look at the figures , what 's going on .
we know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation , but if you look at the budgets of countries , developing and developed , you 'll think there 's something wrong with the math , because you 'll expect absurdities like pakistan spending 47 times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation , even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea in pakistan every year .
no one 's going to refuse clean water .
but the humble latrine , or flush toilet , reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water .
and i think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development , because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us .
twenty-five percent of girls in india drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation .
they 've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in .
`` so if you met an educationalist and said , `` '' i can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent with just one simple thing , '' '' you 'd make a lot of friends in education . ''
that 's not the only thing it can do for you .
poop can cook your dinner .
so these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in butare .
they 're genocidal inmates , most of them , and they 're stirring the contents of their own latrines , because if you put poop in a sealed environment , in a tank , pretty much like a stomach , then , pretty much like a stomach , it gives off gas , and you can cook with it .
and you might think it 's just good karma to see these guys stirring shit , but it 's also good economic sense , because they 're saving a million dollars a year .
they 're cutting down on deforestation , and they 've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible , infinite and free at the point of production .
it 's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives .
here 's a woman who 's about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes , which is what you think it is , except not quite , because it 's actually donated .
there is now a new career path called stool donor .
it 's astonishing , but hardly anyone is still doing it .
maybe it 's the ick factor .
and this is where it gets really interesting , because it 's not that simple , because we are not simple .
it 's been done for decades . the soap companies did it in the early 20th century .
in india now there 's a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that do n't have a toilet .
i met her last october in india , and she grew up in a conservative environment .
and she was horrified to get there and find that they did n't have a toilet .
and she was scared . she was scared of drunks hanging around .
she was scared of snakes . she was scared of rape .
after three days , she did an unthinkable thing .
she got her toilet , and now she goes around all the other villages in india persuading other women to do the same thing .
it 's what i call social contagion , and it 's really powerful and really exciting .
another version of this , another village in india near where priyanka lives is this village , called lakara , and about a year ago , it had no toilets whatsoever .
some visitors came , using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other .
`` somehow , people who 'd been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought , `` '' oops . '' '' not only that , but they were ingesting their neighbors ' shit . ''
so this woman , this boy 's mother installed this latrine in a few hours .
it cost nothing . it 's going to save that boy 's life .
so when i get despondent about the state of sanitation , even though these are pretty exciting times because we 've got the bill and melinda gates foundation reinventing the toilet , which is great , we 've got matt damon going on bathroom strike , which is great for humanity , very bad for his colon .
it 's the most off-track millennium development goal .
it 's about 50 or so years off track .
we 're not going to meet targets , providing people with sanitation at this rate .
so when i get sad about sanitation , i think of japan , because japan 70 years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks , and now it 's a nation of what are called woshurettos , washlet toilets .
`` they have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely , hands-free cleaning experience , and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device which is known as the `` '' marriage-saver . '' '' ( laughter ) but most importantly , what they have done in japan , which i find so inspirational , is they 've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door . ''
the solution to all of this is pretty easy .
thank you .
( applause )
well , in 1945 , supreme court got a chance to address that question .
you 're every breath that i take ...
freddie gray .
so let 's continue .
tanisha anderson .
aura rosser .
only one thing distinguishes the names that you know from the names that you do n't know : gender .
now , it is surprising , is n't it , that this would be the case .
but it does n't have to be this way .
now , the experience that gave rise to intersectionality was my chance encounter with a woman named emma degraffenreid .
emma , like so many african-american women , sought better employment for her family and for others .
she wanted to create a better life for her children and for her family .
now , the judge in question dismissed emma 's suit , and the argument for dismissing the suit was that the employer did hire african-americans and the employer hired women .
only if the court was able to see how these policies came together would he be able to see the double discrimination that emma degraffenreid was facing .
but of course , neither african-american men or white women needed to combine a race and gender discrimination claim to tell the story of the discrimination they were experiencing .
why was n't the real unfairness law 's refusal to protect african-american women simply because their experiences were n't exactly the same as white women and african-american men ?
so it occurred to me , maybe a simple analogy to an intersection might allow judges to better see emma 's dilemma .
so if we think about this intersection , the roads to the intersection would be the way that the workforce was structured by race and by gender .
the law — the law is like that ambulance that shows up and is ready to treat emma only if it can be shown that she was harmed on the race road or on the gender road but not where those roads intersected .
so what do you call being impacted by multiple forces and then abandoned to fend for yourself ?
intersectionality seemed to do it for me .
black girls as young as seven , great grandmothers as old as 95 have been killed by the police .
they 've been killed in their cars .
they have been shot to death .
they have been suffocated to death .
they have been tasered to death .
they 've been killed when they 've called for help .
they 've been killed when they were alone , and they 've been killed when they were with others .
they 've been killed shopping while black , driving while black , having a mental disability while black , having a domestic disturbance while black .
they 've even been killed being homeless while black .
but saying her name is not enough .
i 'd like those of you who are able to join us in saying these names as loud as you can , randomly , disorderly .
this is something that we can do .
it 's up to us .
thank you .
now , let 's do a simple simulation of how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years .
and we calculated several scenarios , and the picture always looked like this .
now , to close the gap , germany has to significantly increase migration , get many more women in the workforce , increase retirement age — by the way , we just lowered it this year — and all these measures at once .
if germany fails here , germany will stagnate .
because the workers are not there who can generate this growth .
but where ?
what you can see here are average numbers .
a long answer would go like this .
sixteen years later , you 'd probably say the opposite .
yes and no .
today , this number is more than 30 percent and it will grow to more than 50 percent by 2030 .
if they are the scarce resource , we have to understand them much better .
now , what are the job preferences of these 200,000 people ?
so , do i get a thank you ?
and now , our global workforce crisis becomes very personal .
and this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast .
three , a plan for how to educate and upskill them .
and if you spend a lot of time in hospital , you 'll see a lot of types of irrationalities .
and here 's how it went .
then they shredded it . no cheating whatsoever .
we did not pay them with dollars ; we paid them with something else .
our subjects doubled their cheating .
but in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
and they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way .
twelve years ago , i founded zipcar .
each zipcar replaces 15 personal cars , and each driver drives about 80 percent less because they 're now paying the full cost , all at once , in real time .
but what zipcar really did was make sharing the norm .
this does express the humanity of what 's going on , and the personal relationships , but that is also like saying that it 's the same thing as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting .
that 's peer-to-peer .
but what 's really happening is that we 've got the power of a free and open internet , and on top of that we 're putting a platform for participation , and the peers are now in partnership with the company , creating shared value on shared values , and each strengthening the other , and doing what the other ca n't do .
what do they bring ? they bring this fabulous diversity , expensive for companies . and what does that deliver ?
it delivers localization and customization , specialization , and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there ?
it 's natural for me . me and my friends , i can connect to them easily .
and it also delivers really fabulous innovation , and i 'll talk about that later .
some of my favorite examples : in transportation , carpooling.com . ten years old , three and a half million people have joined up , and a million rides are shared every day .
it 's a phenomenal thing . it 's the equivalent of 2,500 tgv trains , and just think , they did n't have to lay a track or buy a car .
and it 's not just with transportation , my love , but of course in other realms . here 's fiverr.com .
i met these founders just weeks after they had launched , and now , in two years , what would you do for five dollars ?
this peers , inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm .
topcoder has 400,000 engineers who are delivering complex design and engineering services .
when i talked to their ceo , he had this great line .
it just celebrated its seventh anniversary , and after seven years , last year it delivered 530 million dollars ' worth of sales to all those individuals who have been making those objects .
`` i know you guys out there who are businesspeople , are thinking , `` '' oh my god , i want to build one of those . ''
i see this incredible speed and scale .
`` you mean all i have to do is build a platform and all these people are going to put their stuff on top and i sit back and roll it in ? '' '' building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do . ''
i think of the difference of google video versus youtube .
who would have thought that two young guys and a start-up would beat out google video ? why ?
i actually have no idea why . i did n't talk to them .
`` but i 'm thinking , you know , they probably had the `` '' share '' '' button a little bit brighter and to the right , and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides that are always participating on these networks . ''
so i actually know a lot about building a peer platform now , and a peers , inc. company , because i 've spent the last two years doing that in paris .
there are many , many examples and i 'll give you one that is not my favorite example : insurance .
way too much money , i just ca n't even go there , with lawyers , trying to figure out how this is different , who 's responsible to whom , and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history .
they need a low deductible , and 24-hour roadside assistance .
so this was a trick to get these two sides .
and all the owners are adding their cars . it 's really exciting .
`` you can earn 60 euros . is n't that great ? yes or no ? '' '' no reply . like , a huge proportion of them could n't be bothered after they had just started , they just signed up , to reply . ''
`` so i thought , `` '' duh , robin , this is the difference between industrial production and peer production . '' '' industrial production , the whole point of industrial production is to provide a standardized , exact service model that is consistent every single time , and i 'm really thankful that my smartphone is made using industrial production . ''
we can flag that and we can put it to the side , and people who are buyers and consumers do n't have to deal with it .
so going back , this is my look of excitement and joy , because all this stuff that i 'd also been hoping for actually really did happen , and what 's that ?
that is the diversity of what 's going on .
this would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company .
so what 's happening is , we had the yuck side , but we actually had this real wow side .
what happens in peer , inc. companies is that you have tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions of people who are creating experiments on this model , and so out of all that influence and that effort , you are having this exceptional amount of innovation that is coming out .
so one of the reasons , if we come back to why did i call it buzzcar ? i wanted to remind all of us about the power of the hive , and its incredible facility to create this platform that individuals want to participate and innovate on .
so i continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe .
so for me , it 's a collaboration .
europe at the time was in the middle of the euro crisis , and all the headlines were about european countries getting downgraded by rating agencies in the united states .
a rating can range from a so-called aaa , which means it 's a top-performing product , and it can go down to the level of the so-called bbb- , which means it 's a fairly risky investment .
they are rating banks .
they affect all of us .
and this is the reason why you should care , because sovereign ratings affect everyone .
and that is the reason why i believe they should be defined as public goods .
they should be transparent , accessible , and available to everyone at no cost .
the customers of these rating agencies , like countries or companies , they are paying for their own ratings , and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest .
the third point is , the rating agencies are not really telling us how they are coming up with their ratings , but in this day and age , you ca n't even sell a candy bar without listing everything that 's inside .
but for ratings , a crucial element of our economy , we really do not know what all the different ingredients are .
i think it 's time for a bold move .
and we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk , and we call it by its acronym , incra .
it would be based on a nonprofit model that would be based on a sustainable endowment .
but this is not enough to make a difference , right ?
think about it that way .
and this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward-looking indicators .
these are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country .
we blast the air conditioning the entire way , and we never experience overheating .
so there 's no more signal for us to tell us to stop .
great , right ? well , we have similar problems in buildings .
in the past , before air conditioning , we had thick walls .
over time , the buildings got taller and bigger , our engineering even better , so that the mechanical systems were massive . they require a huge amount of energy .
they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere , and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities , where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas , but we also have problems that , when we lose power , we ca n't open a window here , and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again .
so what do we do here ? how do we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we 've dug ?
if we look at biology , and many of you probably do n't know , i was a biology major before i went into architecture , the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body , and it 's a fantastic thing .
that 's the first line of defense for the body .
what it is , it 's a lamination of two different metals together .
you can see that here by the different reflection on this side .
and because it has two different coefficients of expansion , when heated , one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action .
`` it 's called `` '' bloom , '' '' and the surface is made completely out of thermo-bimetal , and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things . one , it 's a sun-shading device , so that when the sun hits the surface , it constricts the amount of sun passing through , and in other areas , it 's a ventilating system , so that hot , trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary . ''
you can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun , as it moves across the surface , as well as the shade , each of the tiles moves individually .
keep in mind , with the digital technology that we have today , this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces and there 's no two pieces alike at all . every single one is different .
so this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications to actual future application in architecture , and in this case , here you see a house , that 's for a developer in china , and it 's actually a four-story glass box .
and what it basically implies is that , in houses now , we do n't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things , as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building .
i 'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market , and so here you see a pretty typical double-glazed window panel , and in that panel , between those two pieces of glass , that double-glazing , i 'm trying to work on making a thermo-bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity , that thermo-bimetal will begin to curl , and what actually will happen then is it 'll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building , and totally , if necessary .
and so you can imagine , even in this application , that in a high-rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to 30 , 40 floors , the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface .
this last project is also of components .
the influence — and if you have noticed , one of my spheres of influence is biology — is from a grasshopper .
and grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system .
they breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles , and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down , and so in this project , i 'm trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too , how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building .
and so you see here some early studies of blocks , where those holes are actually coming through , and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied , and this is after the bimetal is applied . sorry , it 's a little hard to see , but on the surfaces , you can see these red arrows .
so i want to leave you with one last impression about the project , or this kind of work and using smart materials .
when you 're tired of opening and closing those blinds day after day , when you 're on vacation and there 's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls , or when there 's a power outage , and you have no electricity to rely on , these thermo-bimetals will still be working tirelessly , efficiently and endlessly . thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
and in 1960 , all swedes were saving to try to buy a volvo like this .
and what will happen in the future ?
this is what we will find there .
that 's india and this is china . size is population .
`` i 'm a very serious `` '' possibilist . '' '' it 's a new category where we take emotion apart , and we just work analytically with the world . ''
we can have a much more just world .
this will not happen [ again ] .
self-transformation is empowering , energizing , even exhilarating .
but there 's another type of transformation that occupies a very different emotional space .
first , why is transformation so exhausting ?
and second , how do we fix it ?
but there are things that organizations do that make change even harder and more exhausting for people than it needs to be .
as a result , everything is happening in crisis mode .
or , given the urgency , what they 'll do is they 'll just focus on the short-term results , but that does n't give any hope for the future .
or they 'll just take a superficial , one-off approach , hoping that they can return back to business as usual as soon as the crisis is over .
in order to get test scores to go up , teachers will end up teaching to the test .
most transformations have financial and operational goals .
these are important and they can be energizing to leaders , but they tend not to be very motivating to most people in the organization .
to motivate more broadly , the transformation needs to connect with a deeper sense of purpose .
under their very capable leadership , they 've actually undergone a series of transformations .
it 's not about increasing sales , but about giving millions of additional children access to lego building bricks .
it 's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .
here 's one of the panoramas .
and this is one potential solution .
and there it goes .
absolutely remarkable .
and , the laws of physics . right ?
the first problem is there 's inadequate disaster response .
the second problem that we became aware of was a very inadequate veteran reintegration , and this is a topic that is front page news right now as veterans are coming home from iraq and afghanistan , and they 're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life .
these are actually solutions . and what do i mean by that ?
now on the surface , this makes a lot of sense , and in 2010 , we responded to the tsunami in chile , the floods in pakistan , we sent training teams to the thai-burma border .
we served together in iraq and afghanistan .
clay was with us in port-au-prince . he was also with us in chile .
earlier this year , in march , clay took his own life .
this was a tragedy , but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing .
he lost purpose . he lost his community .
and perhaps most tragically , he lost his self-worth .
because we think that we can give that purpose and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran .
and tornadoes in tuscaloosa and joplin , and then later hurricane irene , gave us an opportunity to look at that .
he leaves the wire . he knows that those people have his back .
he 's slept in the same sand . they 've lived together .
he goes home to kansas city , missouri .
but you drop 25 of those veterans in joplin , missouri , they get that sense of community back .
again , you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates high school in kansas city .
they send him to iraq .
but you send him to joplin after a tornado , and somebody once again is walking up to him and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service , now they have self-worth again .
i think it 's very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance .
is there anything unique about human beings ?
we 're the only creatures with fully developed moral sentiments .
it was all due to this woman , sister mary marastela , also known as my mom .
but i wanted to go further than to say our brains make us moral .
i want to know if there 's a chemistry of morality . i want to know
if there was a moral molecule .
( laughter ) it 's called oxytocin .
so oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in mammals .
but in humans , it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women , and is released by both sexes during sex .
so i had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule .
`` it is , '' '' he said , `` '' only a female molecule . ''
`` it ca n't be that important . '' '' but i countered , `` '' well men 's brains make this too . ''
in other words , i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral .
turns out it was n't so easy .
first of all , oxytocin is a shy molecule .
and when it 's produced , it has a three-minute half-life , and degrades rapidly at room temperature .
i think i can do that .
now luckily , oxytocin is produced both in the brain and in the blood , so i could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery .
then i had to measure morality .
so i started smaller .
i studied one single virtue : trustworthiness .
why ? i had shown in the early 2000s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous .
so poor countries are by and large low trust countries .
but i 'm also a skeptic .
`` i do n't want to just ask people , `` '' are you trustworthy ? '' '' so instead i use the jerry maguire approach to research . ''
if you 're so virtuous , show me the money .
let me show you how we do that .
they all get $ 10 if they agree to show up .
we give them lots of instruction , and we never ever deceive them .
`` and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , `` '' do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? '' '' the trick is you ca n't see them , you ca n't talk to them . ''
you only do it one time .
do you want to keep it all , or do you want to send some amount back ?
so think about this experiment for minute .
you 're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half .
some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle and take four tubes of blood .
so this was the birth of vampire economics .
so in fact , experimental economists had run this test around the world , and for much higher stakes , and the consensus view was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust , and the transfer from the second person back to the first measured trustworthiness .
well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received , the more their brain produced oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on board , the more money they returned .
so we have a biology of trustworthiness .
two things .
so we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin , but they did n't have any effect .
so along with colleagues in zurich , we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo , had that same trust test with money , and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust , we can more than double the number of people who sent all their money to a stranger — all without altering mood or cognition .
using the oxytocin inhaler , we ran more studies .
we showed that oxytocin infusion increases generosity in unilateral monetary transfers by 80 percent .
we 've also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin .
yes , my mom was happy about that last one .
and whenever we raise oxytocin , people willingly open up their wallets and share money with strangers .
after they watched the video , we had them rate their feelings and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin .
the change in oxytocin predicted their feelings of empathy .
so it 's empathy that makes us connect to other people .
it 's empathy that makes us moral .
`` a then unknown philosopher named adam smith wrote a book in 1759 called `` '' the theory of moral sentiments . '' '' in this book , smith argued that we are moral creatures , not because of a top-down reason , but for a bottom-up reason . ''
so if i do something that hurts you , i feel that pain .
so i tend to avoid that .
if i do something that makes you happy , i get to share your joy .
`` now this is the same adam smith who , 17 years later , would write a little book called `` '' the wealth of nations '' '' — the founding document of economics . ''
i just found the molecule behind it .
but knowing that molecule is valuable , because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off .
`` `` '' well this is very valuable . ''
`` we have to find the owner for this . '' '' i said , `` '' yea . '' '' so we 're trying to decide what to do with this , and the phone rings . ''
`` so i said , `` '' i 'll hold it for you . '' '' he said , `` '' you know , you 've been so nice , let 's split the reward . '' '' i 'll give you the jewelry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... `` '' you see it . i was conned . ''
now we know what happens .
so who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems ?
so if you trust them , their brains do n't release oxytocin .
so there 's a technical word for these people in my lab .
( laughter ) these are not people you want to have a beer with .
they have many of the attributes of psychopaths .
one is through improper nurturing .
you need enough nurturing for this system to develop properly .
so we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men .
but interestingly , high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish .
( laughter ) now think about this . it means , within our own biology , we have the yin and yang of morality .
yeah , i 've been worrying about that too .
and i took out a centrifuge and dry ice and needles and tubes .
and i took blood from the bride and the groom and the wedding party and the family and the friends before and immediately after the vows .
( laughter ) and guess what ?
who is the center of the wedding solar system ?
so i think it tells us that we 've designed this ritual to connect us to this new couple , connect us emotionally .
i also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money did n't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers .
for example , through social media .
so we investigated the role of social media and found the using social media produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin .
so i ran this experiment recently for the korean broadcasting system .
and they had the reporters and their producers participate .
and one of these guys , he must have been 22 , he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin .
i mean , astounding ; no one has this .
he was interacting on his girlfriend 's facebook page .
there you go . that 's connection .
there are 800 different languages in the highlands .
these are the most primitive people in the world .
and they indeed also release oxytocin .
and it 's so easy to cause people 's brains to release oxytocin .
let me show it to you .
( laughter ) there you go .
i 'm happy to share a little more love in the world , it 's great , but here 's your prescription from dr. love : eight hugs a day .
and they 're happier because they have better relationships of all types .
dr. love says eight hugs a day .
yes , i 'm in rap songs .
i know , right ?
he was charming and i was flattered , and i declined .
you know what his unsuccessful pickup line was ?
yep . that 's what i thought .
of course , life is full of surprises .
instead , this scandal was brought to you by the digital revolution .
it was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet for a major news story , a click that reverberated around the world .
that people can read the transcripts is horrific enough , but a few weeks later , the audio tapes are aired on tv , and significant portions made available online .
the public humiliation was excruciating .
the consequences for some have become dire , very dire .
it served to recontextualize my experiences , and i then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different .
a meta-analysis done out of the netherlands showed that for the first time , cyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations more significantly than offline bullying .
the echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family , village , school or community , but now it 's the online community too .
millions of people , often anonymously , can stab you with their words , and that 's a lot of pain , and there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you and put you in a public stockade .
jennifer lawrence and several other actors had their icloud accounts hacked , and private , intimate , nude photos were plastered across the internet without their permission .
one gossip website had over five million hits for this one story .
clicks .
we 're in a dangerous cycle .
all the while , someone is making money off of the back of someone else 's suffering .
with every click , we make a choice .
why ? because they all have humiliation at their cores .
the shift begins with something simple , but it 's not easy .
`` researcher brené brown said , and i quote , `` shame ca n't survive empathy . '' ''
shame can not survive empathy .
the theory of minority influence , proposed by social psychologist serge moscovici , says that even in small numbers , when there 's consistency over time , change can happen .
trust me , compassionate comments help abate the negativity .
i 'd like to end on a personal note .
in the past nine months , the question i 've been asked the most is why .
why now ? why was i sticking my head above the parapet ?
have compassion for yourself .
we all deserve compassion , and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world .
i must admit , i used to be one of them .
and that way i can have a greater impact on the world .
to the science of his day , it was a mystery .
we do n't expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics , and as it happens , we ca n't expect our species to solve this problem either .
well , i disagree . i 'm more optimistic .
once we fix it , we just might solve this problem .
as a result , i come to believe that in reality , there 's a red tomato a meter away .
we have misinterpreted our perceptions before .
pythagorus discovered that we were wrong .
copernicus and galileo discovered , again , that we were wrong .
could galileo be right ?
what does modern science have to say about this ?
it just takes a picture of objective reality as it is .
what are these neurons up to ?
now , there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling that we construct what we see .
i 'll just show you two .
`` one textbook says , for example , `` '' evolutionarily speaking , vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate . '' '' so the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions . ''
they give you a survival advantage .
now , is this correct ?
well , let 's first look at a couple of examples in nature .
the female is flightless .
they lose all interest in the real females .
australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles .
now , you might say , beetles , sure , they 're very simple creatures , but surely not mammals .
mammals do n't rely on tricks .
a key notion in those equations is fitness .
for a well-fed lion looking to mate , it does n't enhance fitness .
but remember the jewel beetle .
what the equations of evolution are telling us is that all organisms , including us , are in the same boat as the jewel beetle .
we 're shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive .
how can not perceiving reality as it is be useful ?
it 's not there to show you the reality of the computer .
if you had to deal with that , you could never write your text file or edit your photo .
there 's an obvious objection .
similarly , evolution has shaped us with perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive .
physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid but really it 's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around .
but remember this example .
the theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation of our perceptions .
physical objects are just the icons in that desktop .
we used to think that the earth is flat because it looks that way .
we were wrong .
why ? because we 're blind to our own blindnesses .
brains and neurons have no causal powers .
they cause none of our perceptual experiences , and none of our behavior .
what does this mean for the mystery of consciousness ?
well , it opens up new possibilities .
for instance , perhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences .
perhaps reality is some vast , interacting network of conscious agents , simple and complex , that cause each other 's conscious experiences .
that theory turns out to be false .
dh : well , it 's slightly different than berkeley .
ca : don , i could literally talk with you for hours , and i hope to do that .
like everything else , she was born ; grew to be around 30 times the mass of our sun and lived for a very long time .
but that was no end .
and she evolved into another role in our galaxy .
supernova explosions are very extreme .
in that way , our star had extra energy to outshine the rest of the galaxy in brightness and gamma ray emission .
my star , the one in my story , became what is known as a magnetar .
on the screen , it may look like this .
it is a gamma-ray light curve .
early during my career , i could also see this kind of plot .
but then , i lost my sight .
i completely lost my sight because of extended illness , and with it , i lost the opportunity to see this plot and the opportunity to do my physics .
i longed to access and scrutinize this energetic light and figure out the astrophysical cause .
you may remember that i said that the matter around the star is dragged around ?
yet , information access is not the only area in astronomy where this is important .
the situation is systemic and scientific fields are not keeping up .
information access empowers us to flourish .
but they did n't test for curiosity .
now , my dream of dreams , i want to go explore the oceans of mars , but until we can go there , i think the oceans still hold quite a few secrets .
and i look at this , and i go , well , there are tools to go deeper , longer and further : submarines , rovs , even scuba diving .
aquarius , in some fashion , is a dinosaur , an ancient robot chained to the bottom , this leviathan .
in other ways , it 's a legacy .
and so with that visit , i realized that my time is short if i wanted to experience what it was like to become an aquanaut .
and the point of going down to and living at this habitat was not to stay inside .
it 's like seeing dogs and cats behaving well together .
there was actually a serious note to it .
the pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer , or pam , gauges the fluorescence of corals as it pertains to pollutants in the water as well as climate change-related issues .
but the point of adventure is not only to learn , it 's to be able to share that knowledge with the world , and with that , thanks to a couple of engineers at mit , we were able to use a prototype camera called the edgertronic to capture slow-motion video , up to 20,000 frames per second in a little box that 's worth 3,000 dollars .
and that particular camera gives us an insight into what fairly common animals do but we ca n't even see it in the blink of an eye .
let me show you a quick video of what this camera does .
you can see the silky bubble come out of our hard hats .
elizabeth : if it please you , sir .
all preparation is preparation .
so that 's what i do .
a film tells a story .
the stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic .
so how do i start all this ?
and an idea started to develop .
now , where does this upper city and lower city come ?
but then there 's this mud trap that cuts across the middle .
people clearly do n't want to walk all the way around the edge .
now , this shortcut is called a desire path , and it 's often the path of least resistance .
they 're absolutely everywhere .
these are very dangerous desire paths .
the question that 's interesting is : what do designers think when they see our behavior here ?
or do they accept that this is the only truth ?
the second desire path i wanted to share is at the university of california .
and it reminds me that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design is just to launch it .
( laughter ) incredibly smart approach .
the third and final desire path i wanted to share with you is the unih .
so as you 'll guess , this is a hospital .
i 've marked for you on the left the oncology department .
they were too nauseous , so they 'd walk back to their hotels .
this desire path that you see diagonally , formed .
so you see the desire path .
so our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging , and , where appropriate , pave them , as someone did here .
so these three desire paths remind me we need to design for real human needs .
get out there and see what people really want .
now it was not about riverside school .
so , you 're getting the pattern . first 200 children at riverside .
then 30,000 children in ahmedabad , and growing .
kbs : an inner city school in hyderabad .
first they have cleaned the society , then it will be hyderabad , and soon india .
( applause )
you can see that it is different from earthly metals .
three years ago today , a small asteroid exploded over the city of chelyabinsk , russia .
that object was about 19 meters across , or about as big as a convenience store .
objects of this size hit the earth every 50 years or so .
66 million years ago , a much larger object hit the earth , causing a massive extinction .
it 's so wide that it takes your plane one full minute to fly past it .
i am lucky enough to be part of this effort .
we must keep searching the sky .
let me tell you one more story .
i 've got a great idea that 's going to change the world .
here 's the thing : everybody loves a beautiful baby .
it 's the knockout .
we partnered with a leading medical research institution here in boston .
it won lots of awards .
it 's over the baby , illuminating a single patient .
how are people actually going to use this ?
we took all that information together .
are we designing for the world that we have ?
so — okay , i can now see that man running out there , and i can see that guy running out there .
there are about 30,000 in use now .
and i won .
as a result of these efforts , and the help of many others , it happened .
i won the world yoyo contest again in the artistic performance division .
so in the early '80s , there was a ban on commercial whaling that came into force as a result of this campaign .
let 's also do it for ours .
so let 's pull up , now , something else .
it 's doing that based on the content inside the images .
and i had this idea that camp was going to be just like this , but better .
camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
`` and it went like this : `` '' r-o-w-d-i-e , that 's the way we spell rowdie . ''
now , i tell you this story about summer camp .
i could have told you 50 others just like it — all the times that i got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go , that i should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert .
and i always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were .
because when it comes to creativity and to leadership , we need introverts doing what they do best .
so that 's one out of every two or three people you know .
so even if you 're an extrovert yourself , i 'm talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now — all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society .
now , to see the bias clearly , you need to understand what introversion is .
introversion is more about , how do you respond to stimulation , including social stimulation .
but now here 's where the bias comes in .
our most important institutions , our schools and our workplaces , they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts ' need for lots of stimulation .
and kids are working in countless group assignments .
now , most of us work in open plan offices , without walls , where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers .
and they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
i always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts , including my beloved husband .
and what i 'm saying is that culturally , we need a much better balance .
and in fact , we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude .
this is no surprise , though , if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology .
`` western societies , and in particular the u.s. , have always favored the man of action over the `` '' man '' '' of contemplation . ''
and they featured role models like abraham lincoln , who was praised for being modest and unassuming .
so , quite understandably , qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important .
now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant , and i 'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all .
guess what ?
books .
`` here 's margaret atwood , `` '' cat 's eye . '' '' here 's a novel by milan kundera . ''
`` and here 's `` '' the guide for the perplexed '' '' by maimonides . ''
but these are not exactly my books .
i mean literally every table , every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books .
just like the rest of my family , my grandfather 's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read .
it was my version of my grandfather 's hours of the day alone in his library .
but now all of a sudden my job is very different , and my job is to be out here talking about it , talking about introversion .
so i prepared for moments like these as best i could .
we need to be teaching kids to work together , for sure , but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .
so extroverts , maybe your suitcases are also full of books .
whatever it is , i hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy .
( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause )
now , recently i 've been told i 've been taking the high road .
let 's not forget these men , who are truly dying to work .
( applause )
we are at war with a new form of terrorism .
one of the big things about countering terrorism is , how do you perceive it ?
because perception leads to your response to it .
so how are you going to respond to it ?
you fight it . if you have a more modernist approach , and your perception of terrorism is almost cause-and-effect , then naturally from that , the responses that come out of it are much more asymmetrical .
we live in a modern , global world .
it 's something we have to , too , and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses have to start , in effect , putting on their google-tinted glasses , or whatever .
for my part , what i wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand , say , coca-cola .
both are fairly bad for your health . ( laughter ) if you look at it as a brand in those ways , what you 'll come to realize is , it 's a pretty flawed product .
it does n't actually do what it says on the tin .
you 're not really going to get 72 virgins in heaven .
and you 're not really going to , in the '80s , end capitalism by supporting one of these groups . it 's a load of nonsense .
but what you realize , it 's got an achilles ' heel .
the brand has an achilles ' heel .
they 're the people who buy into the brand , support them , facilitate them , and they 're the people we 've got to reach out to .
we 've got to attack that brand in front of them .
one is reducing their market . what i mean is , it 's their brand against our brand . we 've got to compete .
we 've got to show we 're a better product .
if i 'm trying to show we 're a better product , i probably would n't do things like guantanamo bay .
you know , there 's nothing heroic about killing a young kid .
we 've got to reveal the dangers in the product .
our target audience , it 's not just the producers of terrorism , as i 've said , the terrorists .
that 's where they recruit from . that 's where they get their power and strength .
so the essentials are , we 've got to have interaction in those areas , with the terrorists , the facilitators , etc .
well , reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society . we 've got to show we 're better .
we 've got to show our values .
but when it comes to knocking the brand , if the terrorists are coca-cola and we 're pepsi , i do n't think , being pepsi , anything we say about coca-cola , anyone 's going to believe us .
`` they are somebody who can actually stand there and say , `` '' this product 's crap . i had it and i was sick for days . ''
you can see their scars . you trust them .
`` i wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point , but — ( laughter ) — ted , for health and safety reasons , have told me i 've got to do a countdown , so i feel like a bit of an irish or jewish terrorist , sort of a health and safety terrorist , and i — ( laughter ) — i 've got to count 3 , 2 , 1 , and it 's a bit alarming , so thinking of what my motto would be , and it would be , `` '' body parts , not heart attacks . '' '' so 3 , 2 , 1 . ( explosion sound ) very good . ( laughter ) now , lady in 15j was a suicide bomber amongst us all . ''
there 's 625 of us in this room . we 're going to be scarred for life .
there was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there .
the son 's dead . the father lives .
and that is a hard thing for the head to take .
there 's a lady over there as well who lost her legs in this bombing .
we 're all here , and all of those who watch it are going to be traumatized by this event , but all of you here who are victims are going to learn some hard truths .
that is , our society , we sympathize , but after a while , we start to ignore . we do n't do enough as a society .
we 're going to drive prejudice throughout edinburgh , throughout the u.k. , for welsh people .
they are looking at what i 've started off on , on these more asymmetrical approaches to it , more modernist views , cause and effect .
the fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense . they are going to make mistakes .
they 're not just going to be smart .
`` there was a famous irish terrorist who once summed up the point very beautifully . he said , `` '' the thing is , about the british government , is , is that it 's got to be lucky all the time , and we only have to be lucky once . '' '' so what we need to do is we have to effect it . ''
we need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons in this war on terrorism .
i want to go back just to before the bang , to this idea of brand , and i was talking about coke and pepsi , etc .
we see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war .
they 'll see it as freedom fighters and truth against injustice , imperialism , etc .
we do have to see this as a deadly battlefield .
if we look at al qaeda . al qaeda was essentially a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere which not many people had heard of .
9/11 launched it . it was its big marketing day , and it was packaged for the 21st century . they knew what they were doing .
they were effectively [ doing ] something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franchised around the world , where there 's poverty , ignorance and injustice .
we , as i 've said , have got to hit that market , but we 've got to use our heads rather than our might .
if we perceive it in this way as a brand , or other ways of thinking at it like this , we will not resolve or counter terrorism .
what i 'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently .
`` the first one has been dubbed `` '' lawfare , '' '' for want of a better word . ''
when we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists , everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots . now it 's got a title . everyone 's doing it .
there 's a bomb , people start suing .
a civil action was brought from 1998 .
in omagh , bomb went off , real ira , middle of a peace process .
it also meant , then , if you can imagine this , that the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket that you lived in .
why was it effective ?
it was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void .
it was because the real ira and other terrorist groups , their whole strength is from the fact that they are an underdog . when we put the victims as the underdog and flipped it , they did n't know what to do .
the bombs actually stopped — fact — because of this action .
we became , or those victims became , more importantly , a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization .
just by bringing the very action , that bank has stopped doing it , and indeed , the powers that be around the world , which for real politic reasons before , could n't actually deal with this issue , because there was lots of competing interests , have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system .
there 's another case called the mcdonald case , where some victims of semtex , of the provisional ira bombings , which were supplied by gaddafi , sued , and that action has led to amazing things for new libya .
what we 're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman .
the last one i wanted to talk about was dialogue .
there 's practical problems .
it 's politically risky for the protagonists and for the interlocutors . on one occasion i was doing it , every time i did a point that they did n't like , they actually threw stones at me , and when i did a point they liked , they starting shooting in the air , equally not great . ( laughter ) whatever the point , it gets to the heart of the problem , you 're doing it , you 're talking to them .
now , i just want to end with saying , if we follow reason , we realize that i think we 'd all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it .
it 's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields .
governments are receptive . it wo n't come from those dusty corridors .
the role we could do right now is going away and looking at how we can support victims around the world to bring initiatives .
if i was to leave you with some big questions here which may change one 's perception to it , and who knows what thoughts and responses will come out of it , but did myself and my terrorist group actually need to blow you up to make our point ?
we have to ask ourselves these questions , however unpalatable .
have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian struggle somewhere in the world ?
what if , actually , engagement on poverty and injustice is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do ?
what happens if that bomb went off because we did n't have any thoughts and things in place to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction ?
what is definitely uncontroversial is that , as i 've said , we 've got to stop being reactive , and more proactive , and i just want to leave you with one idea , which is that it 's a provocative question for you to think about , and the answer will require sympathy with the devil .
it 's a question that 's been tackled by many great thinkers and writers : what if society actually needs crisis to change ?
what it would mean is that humans , in order to survive in development , quite darwinian spirit here , inherently must dance with the devil .
a lot of people say that communism was defeated by the rolling stones . it 's a good theory .
maybe the rolling stones has a place in this .
( music ) ( applause ) bruno giussani : thank you . ( applause )
think of the empire state building , the rockefeller center .
and it 's like espresso coffee , you know , you take the essence of the coffee .
inexplicable versus understood . you know , too often we want to understand everything .
therefore it is important that it be real .
silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city .
world without risk would not be worth living .
i do n't like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes .
gabriel garcía márquez is one of my favorite writers , for his storytelling , but even more , i think , for the beauty and precision of his prose .
which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when i realized that i was being swept along on this remarkable , vivid journey in translation .
now i was a comparative literature major in college , which is like an english major , only instead of being stuck studying chaucer for three months , we got to read great literature in translation from around the world .
but not so with márquez who once praised his translator 's versions as being better than his own , which is an astonishing compliment .
`` but the reason that i mention it is that early on , rabassa offers this elegantly simple insight : `` '' every act of communication is an act of translation . '' '' now maybe that 's been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i 'd encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis , i had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light . ''
ever since i can remember thinking consciously about such things , communication has been my central passion .
even as a child , i remember thinking that what i really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communicate it to everyone else .
`` it 's funny , my wife , daisy , whose family is littered with schizophrenics — and i mean littered with them — once said to me , `` '' chris , i already have a brother who thinks he 's god . ''
`` i do n't need a husband who wants to be . '' '' ( laughter ) anyway , as i plunged through my 20s ever more aware of how unobtainable the first part of my childhood ambition was , it was that second part , being able to successfully communicate to others whatever knowledge i was gaining , where the futility of my quest really set in . ''
time after time , whenever i set out to share some great truth with a soon-to-be grateful recipient , it had the opposite effect .
`` interestingly , when your opening line of communication is , `` '' hey , listen up , because i 'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you , '' '' it 's amazing how quickly you 'll discover both ice and the firing squad . ''
finally , after about 10 years of alienating friends and strangers alike , i finally got it , a new personal truth all my own , that if i was going to ever communicate well with other people the ideas that i was gaining , i 'd better find a different way of going about it .
and that 's when i discovered comedy .
now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength from other forms of language .
what i want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives — comedy as the philosopher 's stone .
that it 's about communication that does n't just produce greater understanding within the individual , but leads to real change .
which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of self-interest .
it 's part of our survival package , and that 's why it 's become so important for us , and that 's why we 're always listening at that level .
and also because that 's where , in terms of our own self-interest , we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond , our responsibility to the rest of the world .
fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit the candidate 's fundamental lack of seriousness , cementing an impression that the majority of the american public still holds today .
and the key detail of this is that fey 's scripts were n't written by her and they were n't written by the snl writers .
( laughter ) here was a palin impersonator quoting palin word for word .
on the other side of the political spectrum , the first time that i heard rush limbaugh refer to presidential hopeful john edwards as the breck girl i knew that he 'd made a direct hit .
now it 's not often that i 'm going to associate the words honesty and integrity with limbaugh , but it 's really hard to argue with that punchline .
the description perfectly captured edwards ' personal vanity .
now the daily show with john stewart is by far the most — ( applause ) ( laughter ) it 's by far the most well-documented example of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy .
his intent is to be funny .
it just so happens that stewart 's brand of funny does n't work unless the facts are true .
a great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick , where you think it 's going over here and then all of a sudden you 're transported over here .
this is the exact opposite of the way that anger and fear and panic , all of the flight-or-fight responses , operate .
flight-or-fight releases adrenalin , which throws our walls up sky-high .
and the comedy comes along , dealing with a lot of the same areas where our defenses are the strongest — race , religion , politics , sexuality — only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin , we get endorphins and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows , revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view .
have at it you radical bastards . the field is yours . ( laughter )
and that 's followed by these lines about gay adoption : what is the problem with gay adoption ?
why is this remotely controversial ?
if you have a baby and you think that baby 's gay , you should be allowed to put it up for adoption .
( laughter ) you have given birth to an abomination .
there are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline .
and one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it 's inherently viral .
back in 1980 when comedian richard pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident , i was in los angeles the day after it happened and then i was in washington d.c. two days after that .
and i heard the exact same punchline on both coasts — something about the ignited negro college fund .
first there were drums and then knock-knock jokes .
and it turned out that joel and i were both bothered by the same thing , which was how so much of the debate was still focused on the science and how complete it was or was n't , which , to both of us , seems somewhat intentionally off point .
because first of all , there 's this false premise that such a thing as complete science exists .
now governor perry of my newly-adopted state of texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign for the republican presidential nomination , proclaiming over and over that the science was n't complete at the same time that 250 out of 254 counties in the state of texas were on fire .
personally , i was praying for four more fires so we could finally complete the damn science .
( laughter ) but back in 2009 , the question joel and i kept turning over and over was why this late in the game so much energy was being spent talking about the science when the policies necessary to address climate change were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run regardless of the science .
so we tossed it back and forth until joel came up with this .
shortly after the conference was over , joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the epa in washington whose wall it now hangs on .
and it did n't stop there .
to date , joel 's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups , in the united states , canada and europe .
and earlier this year , he got a request from the green party in australia who used it in their campaign where it became part of the debate that resulted in the australian parliament adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime of any country in the world .
( applause ) that is a lot of punch for 14 words .
thank you .
i 'm not asking a lot .
all wealth is actually created by business .
that 's a very simplistic view .
accidents are expensive and costly .
i 'm feeling it .
one of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart .
it says a lot about her .
the persistence , their ability to deal with ambiguity , their ability to tackle problems that they have n't seen before .
i also knew that i 'm not alone .
and i thought about it , and i came up with one .
it 's called weekday veg .
it 's not quite a question but you can comment on it .
fg : well , i 've always just ...
so , i think he 's icarus and phoenix all in one guy .
fg : i did a teapot and nobody bought it .
fg : because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody , so ...
and for the last decade or so , it 's been quite clear what being an atheist means .
there have been some very vocal atheists who 've pointed out , not just that religion is wrong , but that it 's ridiculous .
now i think it 's too easy . i think it 's too easy
to dismiss the whole of religion that way .
and what i 'd like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist — if you like , a new version of atheism we could call atheism 2.0 .
now what is atheism 2.0 ?
well it starts from a very basic premise : of course , there 's no god .
now let 's move on ; that 's not the end of the story , that 's the very , very beginning .
`` but , '' '' a very important but , `` '' i love christmas carols . ''
`` i really like turning the pages of the old testament . '' '' whatever it may be , you know the kind of thing i 'm talking about — people who are attracted to the ritualistic side , the moralistic , communal side of religion , but ca n't bear the doctrine . ''
i think there is an alternative .
i think there are ways — and i 'm being both very respectful and completely impious — of stealing from religions .
if you do n't believe in a religion , there 's nothing wrong with picking and mixing , with taking out the best sides of religion .
and i 'd like to run through a few of these today .
i 'd like to kick off by looking at education .
now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
education is going to give us , not only commercial skills , industrial skills , it 's also going to make us better people .
you know the kind of thing a commencement address is , and graduation ceremonies , those lyrical claims that education , the process of education — particularly higher education — will make us into nobler and better human beings .
in the early 19th century , church attendance in western europe started sliding down very , very sharply , and people panicked .
they said , where are people going to find the morality , where are they going to find guidance , and where are they going to find sources of consolation ?
and influential voices came up with one answer .
it 's to culture that we should look for guidance , for consolation , for morality .
they wanted to replace scripture with culture .
`` if you went to a top university — let 's say you went to harvard or oxford or cambridge — and you said , `` '' i 've come here because i 'm in search of morality , guidance and consolation ; i want to know how to live , '' '' they would show you the way to the insane asylum . ''
why ? they do n't think we need it .
they do n't think we are in an urgent need of assistance .
they see us as adults , rational adults .
what we need is information .
now religions start from a very different place indeed .
all religions , all major religions , at various points call us children .
and like children , they believe that we are in severe need of assistance .
we 're only just holding it together .
but anyway , we 're only just holding it together .
and we need help . of course , we need help .
well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .
the tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable , because we are in need of guidance , morality and consolation — and religions know that .
another point about education : we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once , they 'll remember it .
you need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day .
`` so get on your knees and repeat it . '' '' that 's what all religions tell us : `` get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day . '' ''
otherwise our minds are like sieves .
they circle the great truths again and again and again .
`` `` '' give us the new , '' '' we 're always saying . ''
`` `` the new is better than the old . '' ''
we 're just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they 're so true .
all the major religions give us calendars .
a calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas .
you wo n't do that by accident ; you will do that because you are guided to do that .
religious view says we need calendars , we need to structure time , we need to synchronize encounters .
take the moon . it 's really important to look at the moon .
we should all look at the moon a bit more often . we do n't .
`` why do n't we ? well there 's nothing to tell us , `` '' look at the moon . '' '' but if you 're a zen buddhist in the middle of september , you will be ordered out of your home , made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of tsukimi , where you will be given poems to read in honor of the moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of . ''
you 'll be handed rice cakes .
in the secular world , you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career .
( applause ) the other thing that religions know is we 're not just brains , we are also bodies .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
so for example , take the jewish idea of forgiveness .
jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh .
so in orthodox jewish communities , every friday you go to a mikveh .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
let 's look at art now .
we sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals , or our new churches .
and the reason we 've let ourselves down is that we 're not properly studying how religions handle art .
`` that 's why a very common feeling when you 're in a museum — let 's admit it — is , `` '' i do n't know what this is about . '' '' but if we 're serious people , we do n't admit to that . ''
but that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art .
now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
firstly , it 's trying to remind you of what there is to love .
and secondly , it 's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate .
and that 's what art is .
art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith .
so as you walk around a church , or a mosque or a cathedral , what you 're trying to imbibe , what you 're imbibing is , through your eyes , through your senses , truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind .
rembrandt is a propagandist in the christian view .
my view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions .
art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we 've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas .
art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
let 's think of something else .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
they 're poets , they 're philosophers , they 're photographers , they 're filmmakers .
and they do n't really change much .
now think about religions , think about organized religions .
what do organized religions do ?
and that has all sorts of advantages .
these are massive machines .
they 're collaborative , they 're branded , they 're multinational , and they 're highly disciplined .
so religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
we need to group together .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
they are multinational , as i say , they are branded , they have a clear identity , so they do n't get lost in a busy world .
that 's something we can learn from .
if you 're involved in anything that 's communal , that involves lots of people getting together , there are things for you in religion .
look very closely at pilgrimage .
you may not agree with the ideas , but my goodness , they 're highly effective mechanisms for doing so .
ab : you can get shot by both sides .
ab : indeed .
ca : but you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from , which is this sense — that 's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who 's religious — of spiritual experience , of some kind of connection with something that 's bigger than you are .
is there any room for that experience in atheism 2.0 ?
science and just observation gives us that feeling without it , so i do n't feel the need .
the universe is large and we are tiny , without the need for further religious superstructure .
how many people here would say that religion is important to them ?
ab : i would say that there are many , many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged .
atheism should n't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
ca : it seems to me that there 's plenty of people in the ted community who are atheists .
politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
it 's seen as hypocrisy .
`` but we need to get to a stage when you 're an atheist and someone says , `` '' well you know , i did pray the other day , '' '' you politely ignore it . ''
because you 've agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
and i think that 's what the religious wars of late have ignored .
ca : and finally , does this new thing that you 're proposing that 's not a religion but something else , does it need a leader , and are you volunteering to be the pope ?
what i 've tried to lay out is a framework and i 'm hoping that people can just fill it in .
but wherever you are , as i say , if you 're in the travel industry , do that travel bit .
if you 're in the communal industry , look at religion and do the communal bit .
so it 's a wiki project .
( applause )
when i think about dreams , like many of you , i think about this picture .
`` and they are what give the word `` '' moonshot '' '' its meaning . ''
and our world is in desperate need of political leaders willing to set bold deadlines for the achievement of daring dreams on the scale of apollo again .
of the 30 astronauts in the original mercury , gemini and apollo programs , only seven marriages survived .
those iconic images of the astronauts bouncing on the moon obscure the alcoholism and depression on earth .
and not just in marriage .
a circle , a ring . it 's called an einstein ring . einstein predicted that , ok .
so the streaks that you see , all these streaks , are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away .
so what we can do , then , is based on how much distortion we see in those images , we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster .
and it 's an enormous amount of mass .
ok , so , a quick review then , to see that you 're following .
ok. so now , let 's turn to dark energy .
so they 're moving further apart .
so , in the last century , ok , people debated about whether this expansion of space would continue forever ; whether it would slow down , you know , will be slowing down , but continue forever ; slow down and stop , asymptotically stop ; or slow down , stop , and then reverse , so it starts to contract again .
so the expansion of space is actually speeding up .
so we need something to be able to explain that .
but we do n't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point , ok .
so it 's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in .
dark matter , because it gravitationally attracts , it tends to encourage the growth of structure , ok .
so clusters of galaxies will tend to form , because of all this gravitational attraction .
so by looking at things like clusters of galaxies , and how they — their number density , how many there are as a function of time — we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming .
do we have anything for dark matter ? and the answer is yes .
we have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter .
now , what do i mean by well motivated ?
so , this is exactly what you want in physics : where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else .
but we do n't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate , ok .
they just pass through anything .
they can come through the building , through the earth — they 're so non-interacting .
it is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the large hadron collider .
and i 'm sure you have lots of questions , which i very much look forward to addressing over the next 72 hours , while i 'm here . thank you .
i 'm a very lucky person .
and my passion was inspired at the age of seven , when my parents first took me to morocco , at the edge of the sahara desert .
and it made me want to explore more .
so as a filmmaker , i 've been from one end of the earth to the other trying to get the perfect shot and to capture animal behavior never seen before .
now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet and actually being able to get that message out gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step .
it 's enabling us to get fresh , new images and tell brand new stories .
in nature 's great events , a series for the bbc that i did with david attenborough , we wanted to do just that .
but there 's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see and had never been filmed .
so what we did , we went to alaska , which is where the grizzlies rely on really high , almost inaccessible , mountain slopes for their denning .
( video ) david attenborough : throughout alaska and british columbia , thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep .
lots of snow in which to dig a den .
to find food , mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast , where the snow will already be melting .
to really get the money shots , it 's down to being in the right place at the right time .
and eventually we got lucky .
for a filmmaker , new technology is an amazing tool , but the other thing that really , really excites me is when new species are discovered .
now , when i heard about one animal , i knew we had to get it for my next series , untamed americas , for national geographic .
and what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the mystery of what pollinated a unique flower .
it depends solely on the bat .
( video ) narrator : the tube-lipped nectar bat .
a pool of delicious nectar lies at the bottom of each flower 's long flute .
necessity is the mother of evolution .
( music ) this two-and-a-half-inch bat has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue , the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world .
we filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times .
so imagine how quick that thing is in real life .
`` now people often ask me , `` '' where 's your favorite place on the planet ? '' '' and the truth is i just do n't have one . ''
there are so many wonderful places .
but some locations draw you back time and time again .
and one remote location — i first went there as a backpacker ; i 've been back several times for filming , most recently for untamed americas — it 's the altiplano in the high andes of south america , and it 's the most otherworldly place i know .
but at 15,000 feet , it 's tough .
sometimes it 's hard to breathe , especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment .
and that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover .
but the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens with amazing clarity .
have a look .
( video ) narrator : some 1,500 miles south of the tropics , between chile and bolivia , the andes completely change .
where deserts freeze and waters boil .
the stars themselves — at 12,000 feet , the dry , thin air makes for perfect stargazing .
but just looking up with the naked eye , you really do n't need one .
( applause )
i snowboarded after school , and i slept a lot .
it turns out i did n't end up being part of the play , but through it i met thordis .
but the gratitude that i felt towards him soon turned to horror as he proceeded to take off my clothes and get on top of me .
i thought i 'd be severed in two .
tom was n't an armed lunatic ; he was my boyfriend .
their skirt was too short , their smile was too wide , their breath smelled of alcohol .
and i was guilty of all of those things , so the shame had to be mine .
nothing more .
it is important to now state that i did n't see my deed for what it was .
and this is a lie i 've felt spine-bending guilt for .
deep down , i knew i 'd done something immeasurably wrong .
but without planning it , i sunk the memories deep , and then i tied a rock to them .
whether it be via distraction , substance use , thrill-seeking or the scrupulous policing of my inner speak , i refused to be static and silent .
i gripped tight to the simple notion that i was n't a bad person .
i did n't think i had this in my bones .
i thought i was made up of something else .
te : nine years after the christmas dance , i was 25 years old , and headed straight for a nervous breakdown .
but that day , i watched in wonder as the words streamed out of my pen , forming the most pivotal letter i 've ever written , addressed to tom .
as it turns out , he , too , had been imprisoned by silence .
i relieved myself of the burdens that i 'd wrongfully shouldered , and he , in turn , wholeheartedly owned up to what he 'd done .
and yet , it did n't bring about closure for me .
in the middle of the two is south africa .
knowing this only magnified the effect that cape town had on us .
over the course of this week , we literally spoke our life stories to each other , from start to finish .
we followed a strict policy of being honest , and this also came with a certain exposure , an open-chested vulnerability .
and likewise , once someone has been branded a rapist , it 's that much easier to call him a monster — inhuman .
how can we discuss solutions to one of the biggest threats to the lives of women and children around the world , if the very words we use are part of the problem ?
i felt deserving of thordis 's body .
the ones that see women as having less intrinsic worth , and of men having some unspoken and symbolic claim to their bodies .
these influences i speak of are external to me , though .
and it was only me in that room making choices , nobody else .
when you own something and really square up to your culpability , i do think a surprising thing can happen .
i thought my certificate of humanity would be burnt .
the noise in my head abated .
but with that privilege of having a voice comes the responsibility of using it .
the story we 've just relayed is unique , and yet it is so common with sexual violence being a global pandemic .
one of the things that i found useful on my own healing journey is educating myself about sexual violence .
but it 's about time that we stop treating sexual violence as a women 's issue .
thank you .
( applause ) ( applause ) i am a papercutter .
( laughter ) i cut stories .
i take a piece of paper , i visualize my story , sometimes i sketch , sometimes i do n't .
so i did n't come to papercutting in a straight line .
i was not born with a blade in my hand .
and i do n't remember papercutting as a child .
and i left everything and went for a long series of odd jobs .
i worked in tourism for one year in mexico , one year in egypt .
i moved for two years in taiwan .
and then i settled in new york where i became a tour guide .
`` and he slashed so many budgets that people said they could n't afford paintings anymore , and they needed to have their portrait `` a la silhouette . '' ''
they can be with words or without words .
and i have a passion for images and for words .
i love oddities of languages .
so i 'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages .
and my daily language is english .
`` so one of these works is the `` '' spelling spider . '' '' so the spelling spider is a cousin of the spelling bee . ''
and this spider spins a bilingual alphabet .
`` so you can read `` '' architecture active '' '' or `` '' active architecture . '' '' so this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives . ''
so if you do n't know one of these languages , it 's instant learning .
and one ancient form of the book is scrolls .
so the unexpected consequences of that is that you only see one part of your image , so it makes a very freestyle architecture .
so each window is an image and is a world that i often revisit .
it 's all if .
it would make a very uplifting world .
and we would leave a very low footprint on the planet .
and my inspirations are very eclectic .
i 'm influenced by everything i read , everything i see .
`` i have some stories that are humorous , like `` '' dead beats . '' '' ( laughter ) other ones are historical . ''
`` here it 's `` '' candycity . '' '' it 's a non-sugar-coated history of sugar . ''
it goes from slave trade to over-consumption of sugar with some sweet moments in between .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , such as the 2010 haitian earthquake .
other times , it 's not even my stories .
people tell me their lives , their memories , their aspirations , and i create a mindscape .
i channel their history [ so that ] they have a place to go back to look at their life and its possibilities .
i call them freudian cities .
i can not speak for all my images , so i 'll just go through a few of my worlds just with the title .
`` `` modicity . '' ''
`` `` electricity . '' ''
`` `` reefcity . '' ''
`` `` a web of time . '' ''
`` `` daily battles . '' ''
`` and at one point , i had to do `` '' the whole nine yards . '' '' so it 's actually a papercut that 's nine yards long . ''
one story leads to another .
i started with small images , i started with a few miles .
then i went to run 50k , then 60k .
then i ran 50 miles — ultramarathons .
( laughter ) and running gives me a lot of energy .
`` the result is `` '' hells and heavens . '' '' it 's two panels 13 ft . high . ''
`` and i call it `` '' hells and heavens '' '' because it 's daily hells and daily heavens . ''
there is no border in between .
other people make the opposite trip .
that 's the border .
you have sweatshops in hells .
you have people renting their wings in the heavens .
and then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we even have the same action , and the result puts you in hells or in heavens .
`` so the whole `` '' hells and heavens '' '' is about free will and determinism . ''
and then you can just walk behind them and try them on .
so it 's like the different layers of what we are made of and what we present to the world as an identity .
that 's another artist book project .
it 's one i 'm wearing and one that 's on exhibition at the center for books arts in new york city .
why do i call it a book ?
so artist books , you take them off the wall .
you can also install them as public art .
`` here it 's in scottsdale , arizona , and it 's called `` '' floating memories . '' '' so it 's regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind . ''
and i entered competitions for a long time .
i made an artist book that 's in stainless steel instead of paper .
and each time i make public art , i want something that 's really relevant to the place it 's installed .
and bronx literature , it 's all about bronx writers and their stories .
another glass project is in a public library in san jose , california .
so i started in the center with the acorn for the ohlone indian civilization .
then i have the fruit from europe for the ranchers .
and then the fruit of the world for silicon valley today .
and it 's still growing .
so the technique , it 's cut , sandblasted , etched and printed glass into architectural glass .
and outside the library , i wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind .
i took library material that had fruit in their title and i used them to make an orchard walk with these fruits of knowledge .
so it 's a tree , and in its trunk you have the roots of languages .
and it 's all about international writing systems .
and on the branches you have library material growing .
so in aurora , colorado it 's a bench .
because if you sit a long time in summer in shorts , you will walk away with temporary branding of the story element on your thighs .
( laughter ) another functional work , it 's in the south side of chicago for a subway station .
so it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter , and not to have objects falling on the rails .
and here i 've been working for the last three years with a south bronx developer to bring art to life to low-income buildings and affordable housing .
so each building has its own personality .
and sometimes it 's about a legacy of the neighborhood , like in morrisania , about the jazz history .
and in 2009 , i was asked to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in new york city for a year .
so that was a very captive audience .
and i wanted to give them an escape .
`` i created `` '' all around town . '' '' it is a papercutting , and then after , i added color on the computer . ''
but the result is always to have stories .
i do n't know the stories .
i take images from our global imagination , from cliché , from things we are thinking about , from history .
and everybody 's a narrator , because everybody has a story to tell .
but more important is everybody has to make a story to make sense of the world .
( applause )
it might remind you of a sort of intelligence .
here 's my story .
my grandfather was a giant , too .
grandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods , and how my family was knit into it .
so i studied forestry .
so i went back to school , and i studied my other world .
trees in real forests might also share information below ground .
and then i borrowed some high-tech stuff from my university : a geiger counter , a scintillation counter , a mass spectrometer , microscopes .
but i was legally permitted .
the first day of the experiment , we got out to our plot and a grizzly bear and her cub chased us off .
it 's a wonderful way to look at these questions , when you write a story .
( laughter ) and they all operate at the same time .
and the results of that may not match what our intentions had been .
what are we supposed to do ?
and it seems like it 's happening all the time .
and i did n't know exactly why i had it , but it was so vivid .
the global mood on climate change was in the trash can .
if you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful ted audience , i 'm going to divulge a secret that has been gratefully buried by history .
and i was horrified , too .
now , i was n't horrified at me , because i 'm kind of used to myself .
it 's only an attitude .
well , you can imagine that i thought that without that , there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of copenhagen .
but relentless optimism into the system .
technology .
and it was n't just the usual suspects .
i 'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do .
so i wrapped the door handle .
i call this the alpha piece .
little did i know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life .
so clearly the reaction was interesting .
the reaction was wild .
so at this point i 'm smitten .
this was all seductive .
can i do something big and large-scale and insurmountable ?
so that 's when the bus happened .
this was a real game changer for me .
( applause )
and there 's not much there .
and we 're no exception , our generation .
it 's comparable to the size of the statue of liberty .
it will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye .
and they 're like light buckets — literally , they collect light .
we can now trace back to 14 billion years .
but now , there are almost 2,000 other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect , measure masses for .
they come in a bewildering variety of different kinds .
so we know there 's at least one planet , our own earth , in which there is life .
the mirrors are cast and they 're cooled very slowly , and then they 're polished to an exquisite precision .
and so , if you think about the precision of these mirrors , the bumps on the mirror , over the entire 27 feet , amount to less than one-millionth of an inch .
this is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy .
it 's tens of millions of light-years away .
so , keep your eyes on those bright images again .
extraordinary precision .
so , where are we ?
thank you very much .
wf : thank you .
( applause )
but they also compete after mating with their sperm .
people have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia .
well , what difference does this make ?
these are movies . they 're fiction .
and by and large , that turns out to be the case .
the things we make have one supreme quality — they live longer than us .
we perish , they survive ; we have one life , they have many lives , and in each life they can mean different things .
which means that , while we all have one biography , they have many .
it does n't , i agree , look very much .
it 's about the size of a rugby ball .
and as you can see , it 's been knocked about a bit , which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879 .
but today , this thing is , i believe , a major player in the politics of the middle east .
and it 's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet .
the story begins in the iran-iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of iraq by foreign forces , the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change .
what you 're looking at is rembrandt 's painting , now in the national gallery in london , illustrating the text from the prophet daniel in the hebrew scriptures .
and you all know roughly the story .
not only the jews , he 'd taken the temple vessels .
he 'd ransacked , desecrated the temple .
and the great gold vessels of the temple in jerusalem had been taken to babylon .
`` and that night , daniel tells us , at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall , `` '' you are weighed in the balance and found wanting , and your kingdom is handed over to the medes and the persians . '' '' and that very night cyrus , king of the persians , entered babylon and the whole regime of belshazzar fell . ''
`` `` the writing on the wall '' is part of our everyday language . ''
what happened next was remarkable , and it 's where our cylinder enters the story .
and that is what this cylinder is , the declaration made by the ruler guided by god who had toppled the iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people .
`` in ringing babylonian — it was written in babylonian — he says , `` '' i am cyrus , king of all the universe , the great king , the powerful king , king of babylon , king of the four quarters of the world . '' '' they 're not shy of hyperbole as you can see . ''
this is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we 've got .
they were allowed to return to jerusalem and to rebuild the temple .
it 's a central document in jewish history .
this is the jewish version of the same story .
`` `` '' thus said cyrus , king of persia , 'all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven given thee , and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem . ''
who is there among you of his people ?
as you all know , that return from exile , the second temple , reshaped judaism .
what was going on was the fundamental shift in middle eastern history .
the empire of iran , the medes and the persians , united under cyrus , became the first great world empire .
and by the time of his son darius , the whole of the eastern mediterranean is under persian control .
this empire is , in fact , the middle east as we now know it , and it 's what shapes the middle east as we now know it .
and it had to be run in a quite new way .
the fact that this decree is in babylonian says one thing .
all of those are respected by cyrus .
the greek invasions ended that .
and of course , alexander could n't sustain a government and it fragmented .
but what cyrus represented remained absolutely central .
`` the greek historian xenophon wrote his book `` '' cyropaedia '' '' promoting cyrus as the great ruler . ''
this is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was .
after alexander , the other empires , babylon declines , falls into ruins , and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost — until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a british museum exhibition digging in babylon .
we only knew about the return of the jews and the decree of cyrus from the hebrew scriptures .
no other evidence .
suddenly , this appeared .
and great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution , by geology , here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true .
but — and this , of course , is where it becomes complicated — the facts were true , hurrah for archeology , but the interpretation was rather more complicated .
because the cylinder account and the hebrew bible account differ in one key respect .
the hebrew writers in the old testament , you will not be surprised to learn , take a rather different view of this .
it can only be jehovah .
god , we know , is usually on the side of the big battalions .
and it 's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah , and yet , jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk .
and equally , he 'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from marduk .
because interestingly , of course , cyrus is a good iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts .
and across eastern europe , jews display pictures of cyrus and of george v side by side — the two great rulers who have allowed the return to jerusalem .
and the cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan .
the state of israel is setup , and 50 years later , in the late 60s , it 's clear that britain 's role as the imperial power is over .
and another story of the cylinder begins .
and so the shah invents an iranian history , or a return to iranian history , that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the cyrus cylinder .
10 years later , another story : iranian revolution , 1979 .
then another iran-iraq war .
and it becomes critical for the iranians to remember their great past , their great past when they fought iraq and won .
it becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all iranians — muslims and non-muslims , christians , zoroastrians , jews living in iran , people who are devout , not devout .
so when the british museum and tehran national musuem cooperate and work together , as we 've been doing , the iranians ask for one thing only as a loan .
it 's the only object they want .
they want to borrow the cyrus cylinder .
it 's shown being presented here , put into its case by the director of the national museum of tehran , one of the many women in iran in very senior positions , mrs. ardakani .
this is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the west .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of jews living in iran came to tehran to see it .
it stands with the american constitution .
it is a document that can mean so many things , for iran and for the region .
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures .
it will appear , certainly , in many more middle eastern stories .
and what story of the middle east , what story of the world , do you want to see reflecting what is said , what is expressed in this cylinder ?
in the world of the middle east at the moment , the debates are , as you know , shrill .
thank you .
( applause )
you live on a small farm in the philippines .
living in tight quarters , one pig coughing and sneezing may soon lead to the next pig coughing and sneezing , until an outbreak of swine flu has taken over your farm .
but then they would have to drive back into the city to test those samples in their central lab .
two weeks later , you 'd hear back the results .
two weeks may be just enough time for infection to spread and take away your way of life .
this reality is possible because today we 're living in the era of personal dna technology .
every one of us can actually test dna ourselves .
humans have dna .
even bacteria and some viruses have dna too .
and in many cases , that same information can trigger disease .
or other questions buried in our own dna : am i at risk of cancer ?
am i of irish descent ?
the inventor of this dna-copying technique was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1993 .
i cofounded one of these companies .
we started working in our basements .
we had a simple question : what could the world look like if everyone could analyze dna ?
dr. paul thomas grows truffles for a living .
truffles are this delicacy that stems from a fungus growing on the roots of living trees .
but even to a trained eye like paul 's , even when looked at under a microscope , these truffles can pass for authentic .
so in order to grow the highest quality truffles , the ones that chefs all over the world will fight over , paul has to use dna analysis .
professor ian goodfellow is a virologist at the university of cambridge .
last year he traveled to sierra leone .
results could take up to a week to come back — that 's way too long for the patients and the families who are suffering .
ian decided to move his lab into makeni , sierra leone .
here we see ian goodfellow moving over 10 tons of equipment into a pop-up tent that he would equip to detect and diagnose the virus and sequence it within 24 hours .
but instead , ian could use personal dna machines small enough to be placed in front of the air-conditioning unit to keep sequencing the virus and keep saving lives .
this may seem like an extreme place for dna analysis , but let 's move on to an even more extreme environment : outer space .
let 's talk about dna analysis in space .
one of these things is that our immune systems get suppressed , making astronauts more prone to infection .
a 16-year-old designing a dna experiment to protect the lives of astronauts may seem like a rarity , the mark of a child genius .
the daniels family , for example , set up a dna lab in the basement of their suburban chicago home .
this is a family like any other .
they just like to spend time together doing fun , creative things .
for the daniels family , the personal dna machine is like the chemistry set for the 21st century .
the ripples of the personal dna revolution may be hard to predict , but one thing is certain : revolutions do n't go backwards , and dna technology is already spreading faster than our imagination .
so if you 're curious , get up close and personal with dna — today .
so this is where people went astray again .
but then you know , i press them like this .
and here you have the dataset .
look here when i move them forward .
it 's on par with united states in these two social dimensions .
1900 , sweden was there .
and there are others who are extremely high .
june 2010 .
i landed for the first time in rome , italy .
i was there to solve world hunger .
( laughter ) that 's right .
we 're going to save money , we 're going to avoid delays and disruptions , and bottom line , we 're going to save lives .
this is not quite how it panned out .
`` just a couple of months into the project , my french boss , he told me , `` '' you know , mallory , it 's a good idea , but the data you need for your algorithms is not there . ''
i was crushed .
when i look back now on that first summer in rome and i see how much has changed over the past six years , it is an absolute transformation .
it 's exciting . it 's inspiring .
but we 're not there yet .
should you buy rice , wheat , chickpea , oil ?
it sounds simple . it 's not .
you have 30 possible foods , and you have to pick five of them .
the unit that i worked with in rome , they were unique .
they brought in the academic world .
with that you can actually trigger aid funding before a crisis can happen .
this is a great start .
why ?
in the world of humanitarian aid , there are very few decision scientists .
`` now , companies will say , `` '' ah ! do n't take our decision scientists from us . ''
this might only amount to a couple of hours per month , which a company would hardly miss , but what it enables is really important : long-term partnerships .
that first three years , ok , that was just what we could n't solve for .
it 's an investment . it requires patience .
but the types of results that can be produced are undeniable .
in our case , it was the ability to feed tens of thousands more people .
so we have donating data , we have donating decision scientists , and there 's actually a third way that companies can help : donating technology to capture new sources of data .
they 've been doing it for years , and it 's led to major operational efficiency improvements .
further , companies that are engaging in data philanthropy , they 're finding new insights locked away in their data .
but for companies , it 's providing insights about your customers and potential customers in india .
it 's a win all around .
we want to make a difference , and so through data philanthropy , companies can actually help engage and retain their decision scientists .
and that 's a big deal for a profession that 's in high demand .
it finally is the right idea at the right time .
( laughter ) très magnifique .
thank you .

i believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling , replicating and repairing themselves .
so i 'm going to show you what i believe is the current state of manufacturing , and then compare that to some natural systems .
so in the current state of manufacturing , we have skyscrapers — two and a half years [ of assembly time ] , 500,000 to a million parts , fairly complex , new , exciting technologies in steel , concrete , glass .
we have exciting machines that can take us into space — five years [ of assembly time ] , 2.5 million parts .
so there 's all of this complexity in our natural systems , but they 're extremely efficient , far more efficient than anything we can build , far more complex than anything we can build .
they 're far more efficient in terms of energy .
and they can repair themselves for longevity .
so there 's something super interesting about natural systems .
so if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment , i think there 's four key factors .
the first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build — so our buildings and machines .
and we need to decode that into simple sequences — basically the dna of how our buildings work .
the first two are the macrobot and decibot .
they 're embedded with mechanical electrical devices , sensors .
so these are the brilliant scientists , engineers , designers that worked on this project .
and i think it really brings to light : is this really scalable ?
i mean , thousands of dollars , lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot .
can we really scale this up ? can we really embed robotics into every part ?
the next one questions that and looks at passive nature , or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability .
it basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts .
you have one tetrahedron which is the gate that 's going to do your computing , and you have two input tetrahedrons .
and then it gives you an output in 3d space .
so what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do .
it computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do .
and now it starts moving in three-dimensional space — so up or down .
on the right-hand side , [ 0,0 ] input is a 1 output , which goes up .
and so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build .
it 's directly embedded ; there 's no external instructions .
so the last project i 'll show is called biased chains , and it 's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems .
so it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system .
so basically you have a chain of elements .
each element is completely identical , and they 're biased .
so each chain , or each element , wants to turn right or left .
so as you assemble the chain , you 're basically programming it .
so what does this tell us about the future ?
i think that it 's telling us that there 's new possibilities for self-assembly , replication , repair in our physical structures , our buildings , machines .
there 's new programmability in these parts .
and from that you have new possibilities for computing .
( applause )
we do not create revolutions .
`` you may know one line of it , it says , `` i 'll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy . '' ''
and we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side .
it 's changing on days ' time scales with human activity .
one satellite , one rocket .
it cost 855 million dollars .
and that 's not the only trick we learned from silicon valley .
our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity .
it 's like some of the smallest satellites ever are being launched from the biggest satellite ever .
what problems would you solve ?
when i turned 19 , i started my career as the first female photojournalist in the gaza strip , palestine .
my work as a woman photographer was considered a serious insult to local traditions , and created a lasting stigma for me and my family .
the perception of women 's life in gaza is passive .
by the time i managed to open my eyes , i had documented this moment .
mohammed got the bathtub on the top of the rubble and started giving his kids an every morning bubble bath .
thank you .
is that good or bad ?
so i start to think a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this .
we started running very low on food . we were both pretty hungry , losing lots of weight .
it was a lack of ice — open water .
if they come to water , they 'll climb in , swim across it .
it 's a special feeling .
i did n't tell tony that . i did n't tell the pilots that .
( video ) : oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh .
the plane taxied up to where i was standing .
the co-pilot was a lady called monica .
it 's that little bar there . he put his hand on the throttle .
this is probably why i did n't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip .
what 's next : antarctica .
as a young magician , i was obsessed with houdini and his underwater challenges .
hi , my name is marcin — farmer , technologist .
i started a group called open source ecology .
we 've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist — things from tractors , bread ovens , circuit makers .
we call this the global village construction set .
so i finished my 20s with a ph.d. in fusion energy , and i discovered i was useless .
i had no practical skills .
the world presented me with options , and i took them .
so i started a farm in missouri and learned about the economics of farming .
i realized that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that i needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just did n't exist yet .
so i did just that .
and i tested them .
and i found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale .
so then i published the 3d designs , schematics , instructional videos and budgets on a wiki .
and now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
we know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity .
if we can lower the barriers to farming , building , manufacturing , then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential .
that 's not only in the developing world .
i 've planted a hundred trees in a day .
i 've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days .
from what i 've seen , this is only the beginning .
if this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant .
a greater distribution of the means of production , environmentally sound supply chains , and a newly relevant diy maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity .
thank you .
again — this time , sycamore — wind-dispersed .
it 's my dad .
no one hears you talking .
and they go back and forth for a while .
and then it goes quiet — 23 minutes with no response from this girl .
`` and the next message that comes in says — it 's the mom — `` '' i had no idea , and i was in the house , we 're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital . '' '' as a mom that one just — the next message comes a month later . ''
`` `` '' i just got out of the hospital . ''
thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression — huge .
we can do things like predictive work .
`` and we know that if you text in `` '' sex , '' '' `` '' oral '' '' and `` '' mormon , '' '' you 're questioning if you 're gay . ''
the worst time of day for substance abuse : 5am .
and we 've made this data public and free and open .
i get really excited about this data , i 'm a little nerdy .
( applause )
i had all kinds of rats , mice , hamsters , gerbils , squirrels .
growing up in a multicultural environment , we had african students in the house , and i learned about their stories , so different backgrounds , dependency on imported know-how , goods , services , exuberant cultural diversity .
africa was truly fascinating for me .
i became an industrial engineer , engineer in product development , and i focused on appropriate detection technologies , actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries .
i quit my job to focus on the real world problem : landmines .
as long as these devices are there , or there is suspicion of landmines , you ca n't really enter into the land .
we chose rats .
why would you choose rats ?
and actually , our product — what you see here .
you see an operator , a trained african with his rats in front who actually are left and right .
there , the animal finds a mine .
it scratches on the soil .
very , very simple .
rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .
they 're extremely sensitive to smell .
moreover , they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it .
now how do we communicate with rats ?
well do n't talk rat , but we have a clicker , a standard method for animal training , which you see there .
a clicker , which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors .
first of all , we associate the click sound with a food reward , which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe .
it learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes , up to 10 holes .
then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets .
in the next step , animals learn to find real mines in real minefields .
they are tested and accredited according to international mine action standards , just like dogs have to pass a test .
they have a skill , which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid .
moreover , this small team together with , of course , you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up .
we have a demonstration site in mozambique .
they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region , and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines .
but let me bring you to a very different problem .
microscopy , the standard who procedure , reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability .
in tanzania — the numbers do n't lie — 45 percent of people — t.b . patients — get diagnosed with t.b . before they die .
and if , however , you are detected very early , diagnosed early , treatment can start , and even in hiv-positives , it makes sense .
you can actually cure t.b. , even in hiv-positives .
already the old chinese and the greek , hippocrates , have actually published , documented , that t.b . can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients .
this is how it works , and really , this is a generic technology .
we 're talking now explosives , tuberculosis , but can you imagine , you can actually put anything under there .
you have a cassette with 10 samples .
an animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent , so it goes extremely fast .
here it 's already at the third sample .
a cage like this — ( applause ) a cage like this — provided that you have rats , and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats — a cage like this , operating throughout the day , can process 1,680 samples .
and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent .
throughout last year , we 've been — depending on which intervals you take — we 've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people , healthy people , per year , you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives .
the way forward for us is now to standardize this technology .
and there are simple things like , for instance , we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .
also , to standardize the pellets , the food rewards , and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .
to conclude , there are also other applications at the horizon .
here is a first prototype of our camera rat , which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .
we do n't have a working system here yet .
thank you very much .
( applause )
i can love jogging .
i can love escalopes .
that is , if i value the escalope , the escalope , on the other hand , it does n't value me back .
hence the eternal problem of love : how to become and remain desirable ?
you had a specific part to play according to your sex , your age , your social status , and you only had to play your part to be valued and loved by the whole community .
think about the youngest son who must obey the eldest son , who in turn must obey the patriarch .
but a phenomenon started in the 13th century , mainly in the renaissance , in the west , that caused the biggest identity crisis in the history of humankind .
next , a process of political democratization , which has fostered individual rights .
now individuals are free to value or disvalue any attitude , any choice , any object .
in other words , my value was once ensured by submitting myself to the traditional authorities .
now it is quoted in the stock exchange .
on the free market of individual desires , i negotiate my value every day .
hence the anxiety of contemporary man .
`` he is obsessed : `` '' am i desirable ? how desirable ? ''
`` how many people are going to love me ? '' '' and how does he respond to this anxiety ? ''
well , by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability .
indeed , our consumer society is largely based on seduction capital .
but it 's not true ! we only accumulate objects in order to communicate with other minds .
we do it to make them love us , to seduce them .
it is rather what is swallowed up and sacrificed in the name of the god of love , or rather in the name of seduction capital .
we can envision two hypotheses : the first one consists of betting that this process of narcissistic capitalization will intensify .
it is hard to say what shape this intensification will take , because it largely depends on social and technical innovations , which are by definition difficult to predict .
we can also imagine a chemical treatment for breakups that weakens the feelings of attachment .
by the way , there 's a program on mtv already in which seduction teachers treat heartache as a disease .
`` `` '' pick-up '' '' is to pick someone up , but not just any picking up — it 's picking up chicks . ''
so they are artists of picking up chicks .
`` ( laughter ) and they call heartache `` '' one-itis . '' '' in english , `` '' itis '' '' is a suffix that signifies infection . ''
we can also envision a romantic use of the genome .
everyone would carry it around and present it like a business card to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction .
so we can expect that modernity itself , which is the origin of seduction capital , would be called into question .
but such a future does n't have to be .
( laughter ) yes , i 'm useless .
( laughter ) ( applause ) we are all useless .
this uselessness is easily demonstrated , because in order to be valued i need another to desire me , which shows that i do not have any value of my own .
i think that becoming aware of this general imposture that concerns all of us would ease our love relationships .
and therefore i want to seem perfect so that another can love me .
it leads to couples obsessed with performance who will break up , just like that , at the slightest underachievement .
what is tenderness ?
to be tender is to accept the loved one 's weaknesses .
( laughter ) that 's pretty bad .
i refer specifically to a kind of humor that is unfortunately underused .
i refer to self-mockery .
for a couple who is no longer sustained , supported by the constraints of tradition , i believe that self-mockery is one of the best means for the relationship to endure .
well , what happened when i was a little kid was — some pretty heavy stuff too .
well , what did i do when i was a kid ?
this is a picture here taken from spaceshipone .
it 's not a thing i often do , so listen carefully .
this is the first crematorium in the u.k. , which was built in woking in the 1870s .
and yet , only a hundred years later , three quarters of us get cremated .
as a shinnecock indian , i was raised to know this .
we are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of long island near the town of southampton in new york .
there were no clouds in the sky .
`` that 's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals . '' '' in my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life , i started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said , `` '' mom , you should do that . '' '' and so three days later , driving very fast , i found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell , capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes , although only two percent actually do . ''
these clouds can grow so big , up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere .
they can grow so big , blocking all daylight , making it very dark and ominous standing under them .
there 's a warm , moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth , the wheat , the grass , the charged particles .
i 've learned to respect the lightning .
my hair used to be straight .
they become lovely monsters .
when i 'm photographing them , i can not help but remember my grandfather 's lesson .
as i stand under them , i see not just a cloud , but understand that what i have the privilege to witness is the same forces , the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy , our solar system , our sun and even this very planet .
( applause )
we live in an incredible age of modern medicine .
we are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago .
and the chance that some of it is n't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea .
we have lost 25 percent of the unique species in hawaii in the last 20 years .
and they get to prioritize , you know ?
it 's that simple . this is an amazingly unregulated field .
we need to learn how to repair and replenish the earth 's ozone layer .
one percent does n't sound like a lot , but it would cause one hell of an ice age here .
this is rocket science , but it 's not hard rocket science .
everything that we need to make an atmosphere on mars , and to make a livable planet on mars , is probably there .
in 1918 , we had a flu epidemic in the united states that killed 20 million people .
we got ta fix that . we got ta outlaw that right away .
number two — my favorite — we meet a rogue black hole .
but galaxies are very violent places , and things can be spun out of orbit .
for three months out of the year , they go to 50 below zero .
so that 's how it works if i want to build a large cemetery .
( laughter ) they also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is .
we fought together , we lived together .
and the poet tells him what to do .
i started listing as forcefully as i could my expectations for their behavior and my expectations for what they would learn in school .
that school was definitely not a school .
i was to be strawberry mansion 's fourth principal in four years .
`` it was labeled `` '' low-performing and persistently dangerous '' '' due to its low test scores and high number of weapons , drugs , assaults and arrests . ''
`` this is not a school . '' '' the halls were dim and dark from poor lighting . ''
this was not a school .
the students were just scared : scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen ; scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food .
they were scared from all the fighting and all the bullying .
and then , there were the teachers , who were incredibly afraid for their own safety , so they had low expectations for the students and themselves , and they were totally unaware of their role in the destruction of the school 's culture .
this was the most troubling of all .
you see , ashley was right , and not just about her school .
i am a leader , so i know i can not do anything alone .
we used two dumpsters per day .
and , of course , of course , we tackled the big stuff , like rehauling the entire school budget so that we can reallocate funds to have more teachers and support staff .
all during the school day .
that brings me to my second slogan : so what ? now what ?
so , we developed a lesson delivery model for instruction that focused on small group instruction , making it possible for all the students to get their individual needs met in the classroom .
the results ?
some of them are parents themselves , and some are completely alone .
i grew up poor in north philadelphia too .
so i have to spend time with them , so i manage the lunchroom every day .
`` and they respond by saying , `` because we like feeling special . '' ''
and i 'm going to say a few words about each one this morning .
the problem is , which verbs go in which constructions ?
how are these construals reflected in language ?
and i 'll start out with a puzzle , the puzzle of indirect speech acts .
there 's a high stakes in the two possibilities of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer .
so this is a rather fraught situation .
the honest officer ca n't hold you to it as being a bribe , and therefore , you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket .
college has some shortcomings .
young people on this journey are meeting with probation officers instead of with teachers .
they 're going to court dates instead of to class .
i have one slide for this talk .
fifty-two times , i watched the police break down doors , chase people through houses or make an arrest of someone in their home .
bit by bit , i got to know two brothers , chuck and tim .
chuck was 18 when we met , a senior in high school .
his younger brother , tim , was 10 .
chuck pushed the kid 's face into the snow and the school cops charged him with aggravated assault .
then he was a high school dropout living on the run .
a neighborhood like the one i got to grow up in .
well , my answer would be no .
but can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class ?
okay , you might say .
totally , that is a good thing . crime is down .
can we imagine something better ?
the question for us now is , how much can we make of it ?
he was a man of tremendous leadership .
how do we solve it ?
but on the other hand , something is wrong .
and revolutions ?
the problem is not technology .
i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
we see people on our screens .
( applause )
living with a physical disability is n't easy anywhere in the world , but if you live in a country like the united states , there 's certain appurtenances available to you that do make life easier .
if you 're crossing the street , you have sidewalk cutouts .
and the context i 'm talking about is where you need to have a product that is less than 200 dollars .
and this ideal product would also be able to go about five kilometers a day so you could get to your job , get to school , and do it on many , many different types of terrain .
how do you make a mountain bike for your arms that does n't have the mountain bike cost and complexity ?
now the big , important point here is that the person is the complex machine in this system .
just like he could in a normal wheelchair .
the first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user-centered design focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries .
and these are all merits that are not just good in the developing world .
the road was too rough .
but the day after he got an lfc , he hopped in it , rode that kilometer , opened up his shop and soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms and started making money , started providing for his family again .
i rested for a day at home .
now everything is back to normal .
`` he said two interesting things , `` a teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be . '' ''
this is a 15 year-old boy .
and then that 's her over there .
`` i said , `` '' you make your own groups of four . ''
i 'll come back after two months .
( video ) teacher : you ca n't catch me .
two children watch a tedtalk .
i sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students .
i think we 've just stumbled across a self-organizing system .
but can an organism like a fruit fly , which is — it 's a great model organism because it 's got a small brain , it 's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors , it breeds quickly , and it 's cheap .
do these organisms even have emotion-like states , or are they just little digital robots ?
charles darwin believed that insects have emotion and express them in their behaviors , as he wrote in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals .
so how do we ask this question ?
so now we wanted to try to understand something about what controls the duration of this state .
this is a very complex challenge , and i believe developing countries could take the lead in this transition .
and i 'm aware that this is a contentious statement , but the reality is that so much is at stake in our countries if we let fossil fuels stay at the center of our development .
and it 's time , it really is time , to debunk the myth that a country has to choose between development on the one hand and environmental protection , renewables , quality of life , on the other .
did you know that last year , for 299 days , we did not use any fossil fuels in order to generate all our electricity ?
why ?
the following year , 1949 , we made that decision permanent in the new constitution , and that is why i can tell you that story nearly 70 years later .
and i 'm grateful .
in the '70s we invested in national parks , and that kept us away from the deeply flawed logic of growth , growth , growth at any cost that you see others embracing , especially in the developing world .
that 's not the point .
the point is that , by making our own choices , we were able to develop resilience in dealing with development problems .
also , if you take a country like ours , the gdp per capita is around 11,000 dollars , depending on how you measure it .
abolishing fossil fuels means disrupting our transportation system so that we can power our cars , buses and trains with electricity instead of dirty energy .
and transportation , let me tell you , has become an existential issue for us costa ricans , because the model we have is not working for us .
two hours in the morning , two hours in the evening .
i do n't understand why we have to accept this as normal .
it 's happening .
first , our model of transportation and urbanization is broken , so this is the best moment to redefine our urban and mobility future .
we want cities for people where we can walk and we can use bikes .
but let 's not kid ourselves .
we 're not talking about ending up with really beautiful electric cars here and a few electric buses there while we keep investing in the same kind of infrastructure , more cars , more roads , more oil .
so we have to protect that legacy and be an example .
how do we get people to own this ? how do we get people
that is why , in 2014 , we created costa rica limpia .
wanting to be a green country powered by renewables is already part of our story .
and you know what ?
by the time the next election comes , i believe every candidate will have to disclose where they stand on the abolition of fossil fuels .
this is our national museum today .
and we will make history again .
i 've spent my life working on sustainability .
i set up a climate change ngo called the climate group .
i worked on forestry issues in wwf .
like many people here , well , i want to maximize my personal impact in the world , so i 'm going to explain why i joined the team there .
this is the number of people joining the global middle class by 2030 , coming out of poverty .
the second number is six : this is six degrees centigrade , what we 're heading towards in terms of global warming .
and if you think about it , all of the weird weather we 've been having the last few years , much of that is due to just one degree warming , and we need co2 emissions to peak by the end of this decade globally and then come down .
it 's not inevitable , but we need to act decisively .
the third number is 12 : that 's the number of cities in the world that had a million or more people when my grandmother was born .
now there are 500 cities , nearly , with a million people or more in them .
sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do to a must-do .
it 's about what we do right here , right now , and for the rest of our working lives .
`` so i 'm going to talk a little bit about what business can do and what a business like ikea can do , and we have a sustainability strategy called `` '' people and planet positive '' '' to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world . ''
other companies have sustainability strategies .
i 'm going to refer to some of those as well , and i 'm just going to mention a few of the commitments as illustrations that we 've got .
but first , let 's think of customers .
then they care about big issues like climate change .
but they want it to be easy , affordable and attractive , and they expect business to help , and they 're a little bit disappointed today .
we had detergents that could wash your whites grayer .
we had the early energy-efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color .
and we had the rough , recycled toilet paper .
so every time you pulled on a t-shirt , or switched the light on , or went to the bathroom , or sometimes all three together , you were reminded sustainability was about compromise .
it was n't a great start .
we can make products that are beautiful or ugly , sustainable or unsustainable , affordable or expensive , functional or useless .
so let 's make beautiful , functional , affordable , sustainable products .
the old-fashioned lightbulbs , the incandescent bulbs — i 'm not going to ask for a show of hands of how many of you still have them in your homes , wasting energy every time you switch them on — change them after this — or whether we have them on the stage here at ted or not — but those old incandescent light bulbs really should have been sold as heaters .
they were mis-sold for more than a hundred years .
you save 85 percent of the electricity with an led that you would have done in an old incandescent .
and the best thing is , they 'll also last for more than 20 years .
so think about that .
you 'll change your car , if you have one , three or four times .
your kids could go to school , go to college , go away and have kids of their own , come back , bring the grandkids , you 'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy .
we decided , over the next two years , we will ban the halogens and the cfls ourselves .
we will go all in .
we 've got to think about the raw materials that produce our products .
obviously there 's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials , and we can and will go zero waste .
and there 's opportunities in a circular economy .
let 's take cotton .
it 's a brilliant textile in use .
yields increase , and you halve the input costs .
actually , we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent .
when it 's 100 percent , it 's kind of clear , and businesspeople like clarity , because then you just get the job done .
so , wood . we know with forestry , it 's a choice .
now together , through our supply chain , with partners , we 've managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry .
that 's about the size of germany .
and we 've decided in the next three years , we will double the volume of certified material we put through our business .
so be decisive on these issues .
but then it comes to your operations .
some things are certain , i think .
we know we 'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years ' time .
we know the sun will be shining somewhere , and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years ' time .
and why not take control of it ourselves ?
so we 're going 100 percent renewable .
for all of our stores , our own factories , our distribution centers , we 've installed 300,000 solar panels so far , and we 've got 14 wind farms we own and operate in six countries , and we 're not done yet .
but think of a solar panel .
so this is a good thing for the cfo , not just the sustainability guy .
so a code of conduct was developed , and now we have 80 auditors out in the world every day making sure all our factories secure good working conditions and protect human rights and make sure there is no child labor .
you 've got to say that 's not enough today .
increasing numbers of businesses are signing up to these , but actually in a survey , many business leaders said they thought their business had nothing to do with children .
so what we decided to do was , we will look and ask ourselves the tough questions with partners who know more than us , what can we do to go beyond our business to help improve the lives of children ?
we also have a foundation that 's committed to work through partners and help improve the lives and protect the rights of 100 million children by 2015 .
you know the phrase , you can manage what you measure ?
well , you should measure what you care about .
if you 're not measuring things , you do n't care and you do n't know .
so let 's take an example , measure the things that are important in your business .
is n't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women ?
and we do not want to wait another hundred years .
so we 've launched a women 's open network this week in ikea , and we 'll do whatever it takes to lead the change .
so the message here is , measure what you care about and lead the change , and do n't wait a hundred years .
and everybody can do something on this as an individual .
so if you 're a business leader , if you 're not already weaving sustainability right into the heart of your business model , i 'd urge you to do so .
i 've been telling a story that has been so painful for me .
and also , the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music .
so i have branded myself as a war child .
i wanted to revenge for my village .
so realizing the truth gave me a position to choose : should i continue to hate , or let it go ?
it 's like i 'm living a dream .
i was ready to eat .
i know it 's a shame . but who is to be blamed ?
that 's my story shared in the form of a lesson .
what energized me and kept me going is the music i do .
but i had this question .
so now i 'm doing music so i know what the power of music is .
today is day number 233 in which i only eat dinner .
♫ i got ta say it again ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ♫ ♫ i 'd be a corpse on the african plain ♫ is there anybody who 's here in the back , some love .
big scream for emma everybody .
this year , if you think about it , over a billion couples will have sex with one another .
and they should be able to use one of these birth control methods to act on their decision .
over one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all .
they want the power to plan their own lives and to raise healthier , better educated and more prosperous families .
but , for an idea that is so broadly accepted in private , birth control certainly generates a lot of opposition in public .
some people think when we talk about contraception that it 's code for abortion , which it 's not .
here in germany , the proportion of people that use contraception is about 66 percent .
their contraception rate — 29 percent .
nigeria , the most populous country in africa , 10 percent .
it 's stocked out 150 days out of the year .
this is the same story across the continent of africa today .
and so what we 've created as a world has become a life-and-death crisis .
but somewhere along the way , we got confused by our own conversation .
and we stopped trying to save these lives .
so if we 're going to make progress on this issue , we have to be really clear about what our agenda is .
we 're not talking about abortion .
we 're not talking about population control .
and i think as long as we 're really clear about what our agenda is , there 's a global movement waiting to happen and ready to get behind this totally uncontroversial idea .
i still consider myself a practicing catholic .
my great-aunt was a dominican nun .
it was an amazing feeling .
and so now , bill and i have three .
now , as a mother , what do i want the very most for my children ?
`` she said , `` '' i want to bring every good thing to this child before i have another . '' '' and i thought — that 's it . ''
but what 's not universal is our ability to provide every good thing .
so many women suffer from domestic violence .
even many of the women who do have knowledge and do have power do n't have access to contraceptives .
for 250 years , parents around the world have been deciding to have smaller families .
the french started bringing down their family size in the mid-1700s .
and over the next 150 years , this trend spread all across europe .
the surprising thing to me , as i learned this history , was that it spread not along socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines .
and in asia and latin america , the transition started in the 1960s , and it happened much faster because of modern contraception .
when they went to get an iud inserted , they got paid six rupees .
and so what did they do ?
and as recently as the 1990s , in peru , women from the andes region were given anesthesia and they were sterilized without their knowledge .
the question is : will we invest in helping all women get what they want now ?
empowering parents — it does n't need justification .
but here 's the thing — our desire to bring every good thing to our children is a force for good throughout the world .
it 's what propels societies forward .
in that same slum in nairobi , i met a young businesswoman , and she was making backpacks out of her home .
she was incredibly optimistic about her family 's future .
it 's where researchers have collected data on over 180,000 inhabitants since 1963 .
in the global health community , we like to say it 's one of the longest pieces of research that 's been running .
people talk about the asian economic miracle of the 1980s — but it was n't really a miracle .
we can help poor families build a better future .
and we need to start now .
because like marianne , we all want to bring every good thing to our children .
and where is the controversy in that ?
thank you .
ca : so what is your foundation doing to promote this issue ?
and what could people here and people listening on the web — what would you like them to do ?
and say that you 're for this .
mg : i know they 're going to see the ted talk because they know that i 'm doing it and i plan to send it to them .
and , you know , the nuns who taught me were incredibly progressive .
ca : so , you and your team brought together today an amazing group of speakers to whom we 're all grateful .
did you learn anything ?
and i think a lot of this work is a journey .
so security is two different things : it 's a feeling , and it 's a reality .
and you can be secure even if you do n't feel it .
really , we have two separate concepts mapped onto the same word .
and language is actually a problem here .
every time you get some security , you 're always trading off something .
whether this is a personal decision — whether you 're going to install a burglar alarm in your home — or a national decision — where you 're going to invade some foreign country — you 're going to trade off something , either money or time , convenience , capabilities , maybe fundamental liberties .
now there 's often no right or wrong here .
some of us have a burglar alarm system at home , and some of us do n't .
and it 'll depend on where we live , whether we live alone or have a family , how much cool stuff we have , how much we 're willing to accept the risk of theft .
in politics also , there are different opinions .
now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs .
we make these trade-offs again and again , multiple times a day .
`` that rabbit will make a security trade-off : `` should i stay , or should i flee ? '' ''
i 'll give you the short answer .
the answer is , we respond to the feeling of security and not the reality .
most of the time , feeling and reality are the same .
we 've developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .
now there are several biases in risk perception .
we tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks — so flying versus driving .
one example would be , people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common .
third , personified risks are perceived to be greater than anonymous risks — so bin laden is scarier because he has a name .
and the fourth is people underestimate risks in situations they do control and overestimate them in situations they do n't control .
so once you take up skydiving or smoking , you downplay the risks .
if a risk is thrust upon you — terrorism was a good example — you 'll overplay it because you do n't feel like it 's in your control .
there are a bunch of other of these biases , these cognitive biases , that affect our risk decisions .
there 's the availability heuristic , which basically means we estimate the probability of something by how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind .
so you can imagine how that works .
if you hear a lot about tiger attacks , there must be a lot of tigers around .
you do n't hear about lion attacks , there are n't a lot of lions around .
because what newspapers do is they repeat again and again rare risks .
i tell people , if it 's in the news , do n't worry about it .
( laughter ) when something is so common , it 's no longer news — car crashes , domestic violence — those are the risks you worry about .
we 're also a species of storytellers .
we respond to stories more than data .
and there 's some basic innumeracy going on .
we 're really good at small numbers .
and the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack , they get different .
or the other way , and that 's a false sense of insecurity .
`` i write a lot about `` '' security theater , '' '' which are products that make people feel secure , but do n't actually do anything . ''
maybe it 's what the cia 's supposed to do for us .
and there are two ways to do this .
one , you can make people actually secure and hope they notice .
so what makes people notice ?
but if you know stuff , you 're more likely to have your feelings match reality .
enough real world examples helps .
now we all know the crime rate in our neighborhood , because we live there , and we get a feeling about it that basically matches reality .
not enough examples .
if , for example , terrorism almost never happens , it 's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures .
i have feeling and reality .
it does n't change ; it 's real .
model is based on reason .
in a primitive and simple world , there 's really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality .
you do n't need a model .
so this model is an intelligent representation of reality .
it 's , of course , limited by science , by technology .
we could n't have a germ theory of disease before we invented the microscope to see them .
and it depended on if you were attacked by a lion or a leopard or a rhino or an elephant — and when you had to run away , and when you could n't run away , and when you had to climb a tree — when you could never climb a tree .
i was born in new york city .
i could have taken him to new york , and he would have died in a day .
models can come from the media , from our elected officials .
models can come from industry .
so models can change .
models are not static .
i mean , there were people who were afraid to push doorbells , because there was electricity in there , and that was dangerous .
for us , we 're very facile around electricity .
we change light bulbs without even thinking about it .
it has n't changed as we were growing up .
and we 're good at it .
or think of the risks on the internet across generations — how your parents approach internet security , versus how you do , versus how our kids will .
models eventually fade into the background .
so a nice example of this came from last year and swine flu .
when swine flu first appeared , the initial news caused a lot of overreaction .
and people thought doctors should be able to deal with it .
there was no new data , but there was less fear .
this kind of thing happens a lot .
we have feeling , model , reality .
and most security decisions have a variety of people involved .
this is not uncommon .
in the history of the past 50 years , the smoking risk shows how a model changes , and it also shows how an industry fights against a model it does n't like .
compare that to the secondhand smoke debate — probably about 20 years behind .
when i was a kid , no one wore a seat belt .
all examples of models changing .
what we learn is that changing models is hard .
models are hard to dislodge .
if they equal your feelings , you do n't even know you have a model .
and there 's another cognitive bias i 'll call confirmation bias , where we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs and reject data that contradicts our beliefs .
we 're terrible at models that span 80 years .
we can often do until our kids grow up .
but 80 years , we 're just not good at .
so it 's a very hard model to accept .
eventually , the new model will replace the old model .
also , personal experiences with crime can do it , personal health scare , a health scare in the news .
they can create a model instantaneously , because they 're very emotive .
i mean , this works as long as it 's to correct others .
we 're here , none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us , not because we checked , but because we 're pretty sure the building codes here are good .
and that 's okay .
one , you can fix people 's feelings , directly appeal to feelings .
it 's manipulation , but it can work .
the second , more honest way is to actually fix the model .
change happens slowly .
the smoking debate took 40 years , and that was an easy one .
i mean really though , information seems like our best hope .
and i lied .
we live in a technological world ; reality changes all the time .
so we might have — for the first time in our species — feeling chases model , model chases reality , reality 's moving — they might never catch up .
we do n't know .
but in the long-term , both feeling and reality are important .
1982 — i do n't know if people will remember this — there was a short epidemic of tylenol poisonings in the united states .
someone else bought it and died .
there was n't any real risk , but people were scared .
and this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented .
as a homework assignment , think of 10 ways to get around it .
it made their feeling of security more match the reality .
last story , a few years ago , a friend of mine gave birth .
`` i said , `` '' well , that 's kind of neat . ''
it basically never happens .
but if you think about it , if you are a hospital , and you need to take a baby away from its mother , out of the room to run some tests , you better have some good security theater , or she 's going to rip your arm off .
( laughter ) so it 's important for us , those of us who design security , who look at security policy , or even look at public policy in ways that affect security .
it 's not just reality ; it 's feeling and reality .
thank you .
i 'm not sure that every person here is familiar with my pictures .
i want to start to show just a few pictures to you , and after i 'll speak .
i was born in 1944 in brazil , in the times that brazil was not yet a market economy .
i was born on a farm , a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest [ still ] .
i lived with incredible birds , incredible animals , i swam in our small rivers with our caimans .
it was about 35 families that lived on this farm , and everything that we produced on this farm , we consumed .
very few things went to the market .
when i was 15 years old , it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger — much bigger — where i did the second part of secondary school .
there i learned different things .
and the most important thing in my life also happened in this time .
brazil radicalized very strongly .
i worked after for an investment bank .
in the '90s , from 1994 to 2000 , i photographed a story called migrations .
i saw in rwanda total brutality .
i lost my faith in our species .
i did n't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer , and i started to be attacked by my own staphylococcus .
i started to have infection everywhere .
`` he made a long examination , and told me , `` '' sebastian , you are not sick , your prostate is perfect . ''
it was the moment that my parents became very old .
i have seven sisters . i 'm one of the only men in my family , and they made together the decision to transfer this land to léila and myself .
when we received this land , this land was as dead as i was .
when i was a kid , it was more than 50 percent rainforest .
as you did here in the united states , or you did in india , everywhere in this planet .
you say that you were born in paradise .
let 's build the paradise again .
it was necessary for us to transform our land into a national park .
it became a national park .
here in los angeles , in the bay area in san francisco , it became tax deductible in the united states .
we raised money in spain , in italy , a lot in brazil .
and this time , my wish was not to photograph anymore just one animal that i had photographed all my life : us .
and i wanted to see us when we used , yes , our instruments in stone .
we exist yet . i was last week at the brazilian national indian foundation , and only in the amazon we have about 110 groups of indians that are not contacted yet .
we must protect the forest in this sense .
and with these pictures , i hope that we can create information , a system of information .
but we create an incredible contradiction .
to build all this , we destroy a lot .
around here , no ? the redwood forests are gone .
india has no more trees . spain has no more trees .
and we must rebuild these forests .
that is the essence of our life , these forests .
the only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing , always , even if we reduce them , everything that we do , we produce co2 , are the trees .
i put the question — three or four weeks ago , we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in norway .
a lack of oxygen in the water .
for the water system , the trees are essential .
you happy people that have a lot of hair on your head , if you take a shower , it takes you two or three hours to dry your hair if you do n't use a dryer machine .
the trees are the hair of our planet .
when you have trees , the root system holds the water .
this is the most important thing , when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life .
i want to show you now , to finish , just a few pictures that for me are very important in that direction .
you remember that i told you , when i received the farm from my parents that was my paradise , that was the farm .
but you see a lot of small spots in this picture .
in each point of those spots , we had planted a tree .
( applause ) i told you in the beginning that it was necessary for us to plant about 2.5 million trees of about 200 different species in order to rebuild the ecosystem .
we can apply it everywhere around the world , no ?
and i believe that we can do it together .
thank you very much .
( applause )
and let 's assume you 're bitten by a mosquito that 's carrying that virus .
so we must be good at killing mosquitos .
well , the result has been very good .
we 've also done this in agriculture .
they understood somebody is following them .
together , we analyzed the west bank and picked 100 families that are living in the most risky places : close to checkpoints , near army bases , side by side with settlers .
in a few seconds , he regrets he came to this demonstration .
how do you film a location ?
this is a much more powerful and much , much more effective weapon .
by putting the right images in the right hands at the right time , we can truly create an impact .
`` in fact , the very first typewriter was originally called `` '' the writing harpsichord . '' '' flutes and music led to even more powerful breakthroughs . ''
about a thousand years ago , at the height of the islamic renaissance , three brothers in baghdad designed a device that was an automated organ .
the organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions encoded by placing pins on a rotating cylinder .
this instrument was the first of its kind .
in fact , the idea of programmable machines was exclusively kept alive by music for about 700 years .
in the 1700s , music-making machines became the playthings of the parisian elite .
showmen used the same coded cylinders to control the physical movements of what were called automata , an early kind of robot .
and as de vaucanson was designing his robot musician , he had another idea .
if you could program a machine to make pleasing sounds , why not program it to weave delightful patterns of color out of cloth ?
instead of using the pins of the cylinder to represent musical notes , they would represent threads with different colors .
this was the first programmable loom .
that punch card system inspired victorian inventor charles babbage to create his analytical engine , the first true programmable computer ever designed .
yes , the military involvement is an important part of the story , but inventing a computer also required other building blocks : music boxes , toy robot flute players , harpsichord keyboards , colorful patterns woven into fabric , and that 's just a small part of the story .
the playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory , seeking out new possibilities in the world around us .
now , i think this has implications for how we teach kids in school and how we encourage innovation in our workspaces , but thinking about play and delight this way also helps us detect what 's coming next .
it seemed like an amusement at best , not useful in any serious way , but it turned out to be the beginning of a tech revolution that would change the world .
you 'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun .
but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it does n't show the thickness of the ice .
the next slide i show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what 's happened over the last 25 years .
the so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , spilling out of the body here .
in 25 years it 's gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the arctic ocean , where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which , when it thaws , is turned into methane by microbes .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point .
professor katey walter from the university of alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter .
video : whoa ! ( laughter ) al gore : she 's okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north .
this is an annual melting river .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
and west antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands , is particularly rapid in its melting .
that 's equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow .
the flows have increased .
in california there has been a 40 percent decline in the sierra snowpack .
this drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .
and the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the united states is one of the two largest emitters , along with china .
( laughter ) around christmas , in my home in tennessee , a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled .
you probably saw it on the news .
frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday .
he 's affordable and adorable , and workers keep their pay .
al gore : this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia .
the largest mountaintop miner is the head of massey coal .
video : don blankenship : let me be clear about it . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , they do n't know what they 're talking about .
video : actor : at coalergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
the fact is , coal is n't dirty .
we think it 's clean — smells good , too .
so do n't worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
so let 's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility .
amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
take a good long look : this is today 's clean coal technology .
al gore : finally , the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
the thread that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
repower america . find out more .
al gore : this is the last one .
video : narrator : it 's about repowering america .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
narrator : repower america . it 's time to get real .
`` al gore : there is an old african proverb that says , `` '' if you want to go quickly , go alone . ''
`` if you want to go far , go together . '' '' we need to go far , quickly . ''
thank you very much .
and she puts it in her friend 's coffee .
so these are the judgments i showed you before , people 's normal moral judgments .
so of course i had to be interested in human rights , and equality and justice , and using my elbows !
we were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the european union .
indeed , when ireland first joined the european union in 1973 , there were parts of the country that were considered developing , including my own beloved native county , county mayo .
but that is what president tong , of the republic of kiribati , has to wake up every morning thinking about .
`` he has bought land in fiji as an insurance policy , what he calls , `` '' migration with dignity , '' '' because he knows that his people may have to leave their islands . ''
i came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer , and i was n't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers .
it was later when i started to work in african countries on issues of development and human rights .
`` and i kept hearing this pervasive sentence : `` oh , but things are so much worse now , things are so much worse . '' ''
but , in recent years , at the time of this conversation , they had nothing but long periods of drought , and then flash flooding , and then more drought .
she forms this women 's group to try to keep her community together .
there was an unprecedented flooding in the country , it covered about a third of the country , over 300 people were killed , and hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods .
and the average person in malawi emits about 80 kg of co2 a year .
the average us citizen emits about 17.5 metric tons .
i think it was really the importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly .
governments around the world agreed at the conference in copenhagen , and have repeated it at every conference on climate , that we have to stay below two degrees celsius of warming above pre-industrial standards .
but we 're on course for about four degrees .
and that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century .
in our world of 7.2 billion people , about 3 billion are left behind .
2.6 billion people cook on open fires — on coal , wood and animal dung .
indeed , no country in the world has actually grown without emissions .
and governments are very ambitious around the world .
in costa rica , they have committed to being carbon-neutral by 2021 .
in ethiopia , the commitment is to be carbon-neutral by 2027 .
apple have pledged that their factories in china will use renewable energy .
they actually could be able to live on their island and have a solution , but it would take a lot of political will .
this , of course , is beyond the resources of kiribati itself .
it would require great solidarity and support from other countries , and it would require the kind of imaginative idea that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air .
but would n't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory , and be part of the community of nations ?
that is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about .
yes , the challenges of the transformation we need are big , but they can be solved .
i was very conscious of this as i took part this year in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in 1945 .
1945 was an extraordinary year .
and then the summit in paris in december , to give us a climate agreement .
the reality is that this issue is much too important to be left to politicians and to the united nations .
`` wangari said once , `` '' in the course of history , there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness , to reach a higher moral ground . '' '' and that 's what we have to do . ''
now , that 's an awful lot of bees .
and most of those losses are because of things we know .
i had the privilege of working in haiti just for two weeks earlier this year .
and haiti , if you 've ever been there , is just a tragedy .
thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950 .
white-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats .
and that is that i think that what we have in our society is , we forgot our connection with nature .
and i think that there is an easy cure for ndd .
i want to talk to you today about prosperity , about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity .
and hope actually is at the heart of this .
in fact , the latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity .
`` `` '' pro-speras , '' '' `` '' speras , '' '' hope — in accordance with our hopes and expectations . ''
the irony is , though , that we have cashed-out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth .
and recession , of course , is n't exactly a recipe for hope either , as we 're busy finding out .
so we 're caught in a kind of trap .
it 's a dilemma , a dilemma of growth .
we ca n't live with it ; we ca n't live without it .
and our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently .
but i think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here .
so i want you to imagine a world , in 2050 , of around nine billion people , all aspiring to western incomes , western lifestyles .
and i want to ask the question : how far and how fast would be have to move ?
how much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets ?
this is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment .
it 's around about 770 grams of carbon .
in the world i describe to you , we have to be right over here at the right-hand side at six grams of carbon .
but should n't we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement ?
it 's a bit complex , and i apologize for that .
what i 'll try and do , is i 'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms .
so it looks a little bit like this .
i just want to highlight one key feature of this system , which is the role of investment .
and what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth .
it does this in a couple of ways — chasing productivity , which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff .
but i want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty , the production and consumption of novelty .
we love new stuff — new material stuff for sure — but also new ideas , new adventures , new experiences .
and here , all of a sudden , we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic — the economic institutions , and who we are as people , locked together to drive an engine of growth .
and this engine is not just economic value ; it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system , driven by our own insatiable appetites , driven in fact by a sense of anxiety .
adam smith , 200 years ago , spoke about our desire for a life without shame .
a life without shame : in his day , what that meant was a linen shirt , and today , well , you still need the shirt , but you need the hybrid car , the hdtv , two holidays a year in the sun , the netbook and ipad , the list goes on — an almost inexhaustible supply of goods , driven by this anxiety .
and even if we do n't want them , we need to buy them , because , if we do n't buy them , the system crashes .
it was above the gdp for three years in a row just before the crisis .
and in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted .
the savings ratio , net savings , were below zero in the middle of 2008 , just before the crash .
this is a strange , rather perverse , story , just to put it in very simple terms .
is this really how people are ?
in the crisis , in the recession , what do people want to do ?
`` keynes called this the `` '' paradox of thrift '' '' — saving slows down recovery . ''
it 's an anomaly , it 's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people .
it was a sunday evening , sunday afternoon , and it was just after — actually , to be honest , too long after — we had moved into a new house .
and i had finally got around to doing some draft stripping , installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts .
`` and we 'd been doing this for a while , when she turned to me very solemnly and said , `` will this really keep out the giraffes ? '' ''
but actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me , because it suddenly became clear to me why we do n't do the blindingly obvious things .
`` `` '' it is , '' '' she said , `` '' to help create the social world and find a credible place in it . '' '' that is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives , and it 's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model . ''
who are these people ?
are we these novelty-seeking , hedonistic , selfish individuals ?
or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in rembrandt 's lovely , lovely sketch here ?
well psychology actually says there is a tension — a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors .
and these tensions have deep evolutionary roots , so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances — fight or flight .
and perhaps even more interesting from our point of view , another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation .
novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself .
tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups .
what we 've done is we 've created economies .
and in the same token , the solution becomes clear , because this is n't , therefore , about changing human nature .
it is n't , in fact , about curtailing possibilities .
what does all this mean for economics ?
well , it might look a little bit like the 4,000 community-interest companies that have sprung up in the u.k. over the last five years and a similar rise in b corporations in the united states , enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart — companies , in fact , like this one , ecosia .
and i just want to , very quickly , show you this .
internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search .
and ecosia works in pretty much the same way .
there you go , oxford , that 's where we are . see what comes up .
the difference with ecosia though is that , in ecosia 's case , it draws the revenues in the same way , but it allocates 80 percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the amazon .
in case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession , that 's the page to go to .
whatever it is , whatever this new economy is , what we need the economy to do , in fact , is to put investment back into the heart of the model , to re-conceive investment .
only now , investment is n't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth .
it has to be about transition .
and of course , this task has material dimensions .
it would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they did n't have food , clothing and shelter .
but it 's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this .
it has social and psychological aims — family , friendship , commitments , society , participating in the life of that society .
`` and this too requires investment , investment — for example , in places — places where we can connect , places where we can participate , shared spaces , concert halls , gardens , public parks , libraries , museums , quiet centers , places of joy and celebration , places of tranquility and contemplation , sites for the `` '' cultivation of a common citizenship , '' '' in michael sandel 's lovely phrase . ''
and we need that relationship to reflect , to reclaim hope .
so let me come back , with this sense of hope , to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door .
to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations .
`` in fact , an african philosopher wrote to me , when `` '' prosperity without growth '' '' was published , pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional african concept of ubuntu . ''
its roots are long and deep — its foundations , i 've tried to show , exist already , inside each of us .
it 's not about overthrowing capitalism . it 's not about
trying to change human nature .
what we 're doing here is we 're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose .
and at the heart of that economics , we 're placing a more credible , more robust , and more realistic vision of what it means to be human .
thank you very much .
( applause ) chris anderson : while they 're taking the podium away , just a quick question .
( laughter ) can you picture the politicians ever buying into this ?
`` i mean , can you picture a politician standing up in britain and saying , `` '' gdp fell two percent this year . good news ! ''
you 're making news out of the things that tell you that we 're flourishing .
when we first started this kind of work , politicians would stand up , treasury spokesmen would stand up , and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves .
but actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing , different kinds of politics , and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently — absolutely vital .
if you can convince me we can do all that , then , yes , i would take the two percent .
it 's called kunene region .
i 'm a himba .
you might wonder , why are you wearing these western clothes ?
i 'm a himba and namibian .
in addition to being an ordinary namibian and in addition to being a himba i 'm also a trained conservationist .
it killed almost everything that was left .
they actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities .
here is our tradition : at every himba village , there is a sacred fire .
our government has given legal status over our traditional lands .
secondly , we put it for infrastructure . food .
everyone needs a coach .
it does n't matter whether you 're a basketball player , a tennis player , a gymnast or a bridge player .
that 's how we improve .
i 'm talking about teachers .
when melinda and i learned how little useful feedback most teachers get , we were blown away .
`` if all my bridge coach ever told me was that i was `` '' satisfactory , '' '' i would have no hope of ever getting better . ''
how would i know who was the best ?
consider the rankings for reading proficiency .
we 're not even in the top 10 .
now , out of all the places that do better than the u.s. in reading , how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve ?
so there 's really only one area where we 're near the top , and that 's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills .
let 's look at the best academic performer : the province of shanghai , china .
they even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues .
it 's because there 's so much variation in the teaching profession .
so we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best .
what would that system look like ?
well , to find out , our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called measures of effective teaching .
for example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?
did they find multiple ways to explain an idea ?
`` we also had students fill out surveys with questions like , `` '' does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson ? '' '' `` do you learn to correct your mistakes ? '' ''
and second , teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools , because they pointed to specific places where they can improve .
i want to show you what this video component of met looks like in action .
( music ) ( video ) sarah brown wessling : good morning everybody .
a peer review day , and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays .
my name is sarah brown wessling .
turn to somebody next to you .
tell them what you think i mean when i talk about moves to prove . i 've talk about — i think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it .
okay , so i would like you to please bring up your papers .
i just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens .
at the beginning of class , i just perch it in the back of the classroom . it 's not a perfect shot .
but i can hear the sound . i can see a lot .
and i 'm able to learn a lot from it .
if i do n't write things down , i do n't remember them .
so having the notes is a part of my thinking process , and i discover what i 'm seeing as i 'm writing .
i 'm glad that we 've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works , what does n't .
i think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we can not convey in a lesson plan , things you can not convey in a standard , things that you can not even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy .
i 'll see you later .
but we still have more work to do .
diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle .
if you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions , you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions .
so building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system wo n't be easy .
that 's understandable , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own classrooms , and they pick the lessons they want to submit , a lot of them will be eager to participate .
building this system will also require a considerable investment .
our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars .
the impact for teachers would be phenomenal .
this would n't just make us a more successful country .
i 'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve .
there 's a giant maze , and joey 's sitting there , and the maze is moving when you tilt the tablet .
also , i come from italy , and the design is important in italy , and yet very conservative .
this doubles also as an ipod speaker .
it 's just , it 's difficult to describe this .
it’s actually got a bunch of circles on it .
ok ? stop . all right , now .
yup , yup , i think i probably am .
so we might have a wild idea , but we’re afraid to share it with anybody else .
now , that wasn’t just self-indulgence .
but before we start , i need just to put these on .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
some of you haven’t fired them yet .
or is it just some weird shadows on the tree ?
so , everybody ready ? ok ? off you go .
so , who got more than five circles figured out ?
hopefully everybody ? more than 10 ?
so it was a pretty successful evening .
and building is the next of the behaviors that i thought i’d talk about .
this is a man-made forest .
i have a forest in the backyard of my own house .
( bird call ) i wake up to this every morning , like a disney princess .
a forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together .
a forest can be an integral part of our urban existence .
most of the world we live in today was forest .
our habitat stopped being our natural habitat .
a few others and i today make these forests professionally — anywhere and everywhere .
i 'm an industrial engineer .
we separate the elements from nature and convert them into an irreversible state .
nature , on the other hand , works in a totally opposite way .
the natural system produces by bringing elements together , atom by atom .
all the natural products become a natural resource again .
this is something which i learned when i made a forest in the backyard of my own house .
we touch , feel and even taste it to identify what properties it lacks .
water can now seep in .
to grow , plants need water , sunlight and nutrition .
what if the soil does n't have any nutrition in it ?
that would be the industrial way .
it goes against nature .
we instead add microorganisms to the soil .
and as their number grows , the soil starts breathing again .
we survey the native tree species of the place .
we survey the sacred groves , or sacred forests around old temples .
it could be a flowering forest , a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees , or it could simply be a native , wild evergreen forest .
so if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree , these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree .
this dense forest condenses the moist air and retains its moisture .
this decayed biomass forms humus , which is food for the forest .
it 's a tiny jungle party .
this is an ambucycle .
this is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency .
when i was looking at these pictures , it brought me back many years to my past when i was a child .
i grew up in a small neighborhood in jerusalem .
i remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up .
we were so scared and we just ran away .
growing up , i decided i wanted to become a doctor and save lives .
when i was 15 , i took an emt course , and i went to volunteer on an ambulance .
for two years , i volunteered on an ambulance in jerusalem .
i helped many people , but whenever someone really needed help , i never got there in time . we never got there .
when we got there , 20 minutes later , we started cpr on the kid .
that second he declared this child dead .
at that moment , i understood that this child died for nothing .
`` we 'll buy these beepers , just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper , and we will run and save lives . '' '' well , he was laughing . i was 17 years old . i was a kid . ''
`` and he said to me — i remember this like yesterday — he was a great guy , but he said to me , `` '' kid , go to school , or go open a falafel stand . ''
we 're not really interested in these kinds of new adventures .
`` we 're not interested in your help . '' '' and he threw me out of the room . ''
i was a very stubborn kid .
as you see now , i 'm walking around like crazy , meshugenah .
`` ( laughter ) ( applause ) so i decided to use the israeli very famous technique you 've probably all heard of , chutzpah . ( laughter ) and the next day , i went and i bought two police scanners , and i said , `` '' the hell with you , if you do n't want to give me information , i 'll get the information myself . '' '' and we did turns , who 's going to listen to the radio scanners . ''
the next day , while i was listening to the scanners , i heard about a call coming in of a 70-year-old man hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood .
when i got there , the 70-year-old man was lying on the floor , blood was gushing out of his neck .
he was on coumadin .
i knew i had to stop his bleeding or else he would die .
i took off my yarmulke , because i had no medical equipment , and with a lot of pressure , i stopped his bleeding .
when the ambulance arrived 15 minutes later , i gave them over a patient who was alive .
the reasons why we 're so successful are because of three things .
and we save people that otherwise would not be saved .
and this is a great technology we use all over the country and reduce the response time .
these ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels .
they never get stuck in traffic . they could even go on a sidewalk .
that 's why we get there so fast .
a few years after i started this organization , in a jewish community , two muslims from east jerusalem called me up .
they ask me to meet . they wanted to meet with me .
arabs were saving jews . jews were saving arabs .
and these are all volunteers .
i never imagined that one day i 'd be speaking at tedmed .
all i need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me , passionate about saving lives , and willing to do it .
hatzalah actually started in brooklyn by a hasidic jew years before us in williamsburg , and now it 's all over the jewish community in new york , even australia and mexico and many other jewish communities .
but it could spread everywhere .
you even saw these volunteers in new york saving lives in the world trade center .
last year alone , we treated in israel 207,000 people .
forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations .
and we made a difference .
when i look all around here , i see lots of people who would go an extra mile , run an extra mile to save other people , no matter who they are , no matter what religion , no matter who , where they come from .
thank you very much .
( applause )
today we have sexting , and i am a sexting expert .
not an expert sexter .
i wrote a book on the moral panic about sexting .
the key is consent .
right now most people are thinking about sexting without really thinking about consent at all .
most teens do n't get arrested for sexting , but can you guess who does ?
according to researchers at the university of new hampshire seven percent of all child pornography possession arrests are teens , sexting consensually with other teens .
parents and educators are also responding to sexting without really thinking too much about consent .
and most of the time , nothing goes wrong .
in 1908 , ford introduced the model t car .
and we can do the same thing with digital privacy .
of course , it comes back to consent .
this idea of affirmative consent comes from anti-rape activists who tell us that we need consent for every sexual act .
all of your financial information is held in digital databases , but your credit card company ca n't just post your purchase history online .
as princeton researcher janet vertesi argues , our data and our privacy , they 're not just personal , they 're actually interpersonal .
and so one thing you can do that 's really easy is just start asking for permission before you share anyone else 's information .
if you want to forward an email thread , ask for permission .
jennifer was embarrassed and humiliated , but instead of being compassionate , her classmates harassed her .
jennifer started missing school and her grades dropped .
jennifer did nothing wrong .
because the problem is not sexting , the issue is digital privacy .
and one solution is consent .
i worked slowly , using an analog film camera with a manual focusing loop and a handheld light meter .
rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on february 20 , which became known as bloody thursday .
many were women who often carried flowers that they had brought to lay as marks of respect for the dead .
it was quiet and i could hear the birds singing .
most women cried when i photographed them .
there had been such a noticeable absence of women up until that point .
if the men showed the ideal of the warrior , then the women showed the implications of such violence .
i was in ukraine again six weeks ago .
the fighters , the women and the flowers are gone .
`` the word `` '' hobo '' '' conjures up an old black and white image of a weathered old man covered in coal , legs dangling out of a boxcar , but these photographs are in color , and they portray a community swirling across the country , fiercely alive and creatively free , seeing sides of america that no one else gets to see . ''
like their predecessors , today 's nomads travel the steel and asphalt arteries of the united states .
by day , they hop freight trains , stick out their thumbs , and ride the highways with anyone from truckers to soccer moms .
some travelers take to the road by choice , renouncing materialism , traditional jobs and university degrees in exchange for a glimmer of adventure .
they sacrifice material comforts in exchange for the space and the time to explore a creative interior , to dream , to read , to work on music , art and writing .
but there are many aspects to this life that are far from idyllic .
i know about these laws because i 've watched as friends and other travelers were hauled off to jail or received citations for committing these so-called crimes .
( applause )
in a moment , i 'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this .
1847 , vienna , austria .
trying to figure out what the difference was that caused this , semmelweis looked at everything he could .
sanitation ? no .
but the doctors of the day thought he was crazy , because they knew , and had for hundreds of years , that odorous vapors called miasmas caused disease , not these hypothetical particles that you could n't see .
it took 20 years for frenchman louis pasteur to prove that semmelweis was right .
he did it for two reasons .
so this brings me to the two ideas i want to talk about tonight .
let 's get started with dr. eric betzig .
there 's this thing called the law of physics , and part of the law of physics is the thing called the diffraction limit .
so he lashed together a microscope in his friend 's living room .
he had no laboratory .
no .
he wanted movies .
so what did he do ?
but when we figure it out , we 'll have a better handle on life itself .
for example , those green globs that you see ?
they 're molecules that protect other molecules as they move through a cell .
those are actin molecules .
you might have heard of those .
also known as oxygen ions , those bind to our dna , cause it to mutate , and cause us to get old and lose our hair .
so if you stop aging , all of you are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors .
yeah , he started off life as a computer scientist , not a biologist , but he earned a phd in biology from cambridge , and he has published some very significant work on mitochondrial dna and a bunch of other stuff .
he believes , and he 's made a convincing case , that using viruses we can do gene therapy , fix that dna and rejuvenate our cells .
we have an existent proof that extreme longevity is possible .
bristlecone pine trees live 5,000 years , and some lobsters do n't age at all .
i mean , after all , we 're not trees , and most of us are not lobsters .
there are four times as many people alive today as einstein .
but genius rose to the challenge .
you are at critical juncture now in the ceiling .
the sistine chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror .
who am i in this picture ?
thank you .
so instead we 're going to do 93 years in 93 seconds or less .
( laughter ) you were born in new hampshire .
he was taken away to prison when you were nine years old .
you have seven shows in the top 10 at one time .
then came the movies .
but the fact that he was going to oklahoma in a plane , and he was going to bring me back a 10-gallon hat , just like ken maynard , my favorite cowboy wore .
you know , this was a few years after lindbergh crossed the atlantic .
that night newspapers were all over the house , my father was with his hat in front of his face , manacled to a detective .
and my mother was selling the furniture , because we were leaving — she did n't want to stay in that state of shame , in chelsea , massachusetts .
`` i 'm crying , and this asshole says , `` '' you 're the man of the house now . '' '' and i think that was the moment i began to understand the foolishness of the human condition . ''
but — eh : it 's interesting you call it a benefit .
and i ...
( laughter ) yeah , somebody laughed . ( laughter )
tell us about him .
well here 's the way i always talked about that grandfather .
and he meant a great deal to me .
and he used to write presidents of the united states .
`` every letter started , `` my dearest , darling mr. president , '' and he 'd tell him something wonderful about what he did . ''
this will be the second time i have said the whole story was a lie .
the truth was my grandfather took me to parades , we had lots of those .
the truth is a tear came down his eye .
`` but `` '' my dearest darling mr. president , '' '' all the rest of it , is a story i borrowed from a good friend whose grandfather was that grandfather who wrote those letters . ''
always .
`` `` even this i get to experience . '' ''
`` so much so , the word `` '' father '' '' — i have six kids by the way . ''
my favorite role in life .
it and husband to my wife lyn .
the fact that he lied and stole and cheated and went to prison ...
`` i submerge that in the word `` '' rascal . '' '' eh : well there 's a saying that amateurs borrow and professionals steal . ''
eh : you 're a pro .
but have there ever been any stories about the impact of your work that surprised you ?
nl : oh , god — surprised me and delighted me from head to toe .
`` and when he talked about the shows , he was n't talking about the hollywood , george jefferson in `` '' the jeffersons , '' '' or the show that was a number five show . ''
he was talking about a simple thing that made a big — eh : impact on him ?
`` he saw george jefferson write a check on `` '' the jeffersons , '' '' and he never knew that a black man could write a check . ''
`` and when i hear things like that — little things — because i know that there is n't anybody in this audience that was n't likely responsible today for some little thing they did for somebody , whether it 's as little as a smile or an unexpected `` '' hello , '' '' that 's how little this thing was . ''
( laughter ) eh : you 've lead a life of accomplishment , but you 've also built a life of meaning .
but even those of us who do manage to accomplish both of those , very rarely do we figure out how to do them together .
you managed to push culture forward through your art while also achieving world-beating commercial success .
how did you do both ?
anything i may have accomplished is — my sister once asked me what she does about something that was going on in newington , connecticut .
i am convinced we 're all responsible for doing as much as i may have accomplished .
eh : but here on this planet you have really mattered .
nl : i 'm a son of a gun .
how old do you feel ?
nl : i am the peer of whoever i 'm talking to .
eh : well , i feel 93 .
ladies and gentlemen , the incomparable norman lear .
i do n't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room , but by any standard they have never been flourishing to a greater extent .
but here , there — one of the most famous literary english scholars of our time is the berkeley professor , judith butler .
by the way , this is one sentence — you can actually parse it .
people are staying away from elite art and criticism .
well , this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book .
but it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors .
well , the other hot button is parenting .
until the studies are redone with adoptive children , who provide an environment but not genes to their kids , we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid .
the genetically controlled studies have some sobering results .
everything that happens to you in a given home over all of those years appears to leave no permanent stamp on your personality or intellect .
and that presents us with a choice .
thank you very much .
