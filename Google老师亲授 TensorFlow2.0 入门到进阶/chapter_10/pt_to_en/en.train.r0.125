you see the green is a traditional interstate conflict , the ones we used to read about .
my point is that you do n't have to be neutral to talk .
but if you do n't talk , you ca n't engage the other side .
this is tahrir square .
there 's a revolution going on .
so now that they are emerging in the street and we salute the democratic revolution , we find out how little we know .
because they may turn out to be a majority .
and if we can not demonstrate to these groups that if you move towards democracy , if you move towards taking part in civilized and normal standards among states , there are some rewards on the other side .
if we 're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts , if we 're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom-up , supported by technology , which is available to all , we diplomats can not be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations .
we have to connect with these profound changes .
but that strategy seldom takes you very far .
we could never have done the convention against anti-personnel landmines and the convention that is banning cluster munitions unless we had done diplomacy differently , by engaging with civil society .
all of a sudden , ngos were not only standing in the streets , crying their slogans , but they were taking [ them ] into the negotiations , partly because they represented the victims of these weapons .
it 's crucial to understand , i believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom-up .
so there are many reasons , and for all of these reasons , this is time and this is why we must talk .
( applause )
but i also see lots of poverty , and it 's quite jarring , both in the scale and the scope of it .
well , if we 're going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of millennium development goals that we 're set as a world , we need to learn from the innovators , and those innovators come from every single sector .
and i think there are really three things we can take away from coca-cola .
they tap into local entrepreneurial talent , and they do incredible marketing .
they have this very continuous feedback loop .
that is having real impact in a country like ethiopia , and it 's why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008 .
`` let 's listen to this song that coke created for it , `` '' wavin ' flag '' '' by a somali hip hop artist . ''
and it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries .
well , it 's based on avoidance , not aspirations .
they 're waiting to be circumcised .
so if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development , we can change communities and we can change whole nations .
so exploration can pay for itself .
why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us ?
what does a human brain have or do that no other brain does ?
but let 's play along .
that 's because the size of the brain usually follows the size of the body .
so this to me became the important question to answer : how many neurons does the human brain have , and how does that compare to other animals ?
it seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain , or in any other brain for that matter .
so i came up with my own way to count cells in the brain , and it essentially consists of dissolving that brain into soup .
take rodents and primates , for instance : in larger rodent brains , the average size of the neuron increases , so the brain inflates very rapidly and gains size much faster than it gains neurons .
the result is that a primate brain will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size , and the larger the brain , the larger this difference will be .
i do n't think it looks like us .
compared to a rat , we might seem special , yes , but that 's not a fair comparison to make , given that we know that we are not rodents .
so the human brain may be remarkable , yes , but it is not special in its number of neurons .
well , if our brain costs just as much energy as it should , and if we ca n't spend every waking hour of the day feeding , then the only alternative , really , is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods .
cooked foods are softer , so they 're easier to chew and to turn completely into mush in your mouth , so that allows them to be completely digested and absorbed in your gut , which makes them yield much more energy in much less time .
so because of cooking , what once was a major liability , this large , dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons , could now become a major asset , now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons and the time to do interesting things with them .
for example , if you shine light through a superfluid , it is able to slow photons down to 60 kilometers per hour .
of course , that 's just the time we 're losing sitting through presentations .
the sun burns our peripheral vision .
and in the time since galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies , the known universe has come to us through light , across vast eras in cosmic history .
so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song , which i 'd like to play for you — some of our predictions for what that song will be like .
we ca n't see them directly .
einstein also realized — and this is the real meat of the matter — that if you put energy or mass in the universe , it would curve space , and a freely falling object would pass by , let 's say , the sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space .
now even light will be bent by those paths .
what einstein did not realize was that , if you took our sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers — so you took a million times the mass of the earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across , you would make a black hole , an object so dense that if light veered too close , it would never escape — a dark shadow against the universe .
i like to imagine schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire , and then , in between , calculating einstein 's equations — as you do in the trenches .
and he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary : curves so strong that space would rain down into them , space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole .
`` now he wrote to einstein , and he said , `` '' as you will see , the war has been kind to me enough . ''
he did not believe they existed in nature .
`` it was decades before the term `` '' black hole '' '' was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects — in fact they 're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime . ''
we 're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of manhattan .
it can not hide behind the black hole .
the light from the earth , some of it falls in , but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us .
maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes — each one 10 times the mass of the sun .
space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .
if you were standing near enough , your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space .
you would literally hear the sound .
this is from my group — a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
it 's sort of like ding , ding , ding .
there are very industrious experiments being built on earth — one called ligo — which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .
in this hubble image , we see two galaxies .
but they 're not frozen ; they 're actually merging .
we were n't even here .
it gets closer and closer — 40,000 years ago , we 're still doing cave paintings .
it 's like hurry , build your instruments .
if it was the big bang we were going to pick up , it would sound like this .
it 's literally the definition of noise .
or , is it possible that we 're just a branch off of a multiverse — each branch with its own big bang in its past — maybe some of them with black holes playing drums , maybe some without — maybe some with sentient life , and maybe some without — not in our past , not in our future , but somehow fundamentally connected to us ?
here 's my multiverse creatures .
and after being totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness and history of chinese culture , it was like this total relief to hear something so truly american and so truly awesome .
inside your heart a voice is calling .
it 's just incredible .
and this little girl comes up to me .
thank you .
we all die . we all get old . we all get sick . people leave us .
so , we said , what else could we do ?
so the most common question i get asked , and i 'm going to answer it now so i do n't have to do it over drinks tonight , is how did this come about ?
and we persisted , and we got 450 guys growing mustaches , and together we raised 54,000 dollars , and we donated every cent of that to the prostate cancer foundation of australia , and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they 'd ever received .
`` and he goes , `` '' listen , i know it 's about men 's health , i know it 's about prostate cancer , but this is for breast cancer . '' '' and i said , `` '' okay , that 's interesting . '' '' and he goes , `` '' last year , my mom passed away from breast cancer in sri lanka , because we could n't afford proper treatment for her , '' '' and he said , `` '' this mustache is my tribute to my mom . '' '' and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi , and i did n't tell him who i was , because i did n't think it was appropriate , and i just shook his hand and i said , `` '' thank you so much . ''
`` your mom would be so proud . '' '' and from that moment i realized that movember is so much more than a mustache , having a joke . ''
for us now at movember , we really focus on three program areas , and having a true impact : awareness and education , survivor support programs , and research .
`` of 26 , for the first time ever , i had a conversation with my dad one on one about men 's health . i had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer , and i learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and i was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease , and he did n't know that , and he had n't been getting screened for it . '' '' so now , that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer . ''
we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries .
so now we 're funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together , and that 's a unique thing in the cancer world , and we know , through that collaboration , it will accelerate outcomes .
so , what i know about my movember journey is that , with a really creative idea , with passion , with persistence , and a lot of patience , four mates , four mustaches , can inspire a room full of people , and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city , and that city is melbourne , my home .
i see anxiety .
so gwen , i 'm going to hand you this envelope .
was it working in the sun ?
coral reefs are farmers .
now , there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet , maybe 1,000 .
before i could say anything , tell him how foolish he had made me look in front of my friends , he derided me for being so naive .
`` `` '' i wish ashley judd would die a horrible death . ''
this is really critical .
that allowed me to take a stand for myself .
and let 's talk about work .
and my expressing it does not pornography make .
shall we talk about our friends in tech ?
aj : god does good work .
bless you .
and then we went to teachers .
even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment — on the side of the road or next to a river .
the camera is actually tracking all your gestures .
this is the coal supply for the steel factory — 18 square kilometers .
in fact , it 's likely happening right now as we speak .
why , when i die , should they not have their turn with me ?
we 'll start with a dead body .
finally , the industry will beautify the corpse .
now , if this system of beautification , sanitation , protection does n't appeal to you , you are not alone .
but she was frightened . she 'd lived 95 years and she 'd never had a hallucination before .
his vision was pretty poor .
ca : and they do n't disturb you ?
i would love to give you a little perspective on what a day in my life can look like .
and although i could n't even feel my finger to push the trigger , i knew i was n't getting out .
( applause )
that part .
i mean , you just have to do it .
come on .
ah , sorry about that .
forgot this .
all right . let 's try this .
the song is just a given , that 's how you have to think about it .
this is africa . it 's hot .
so our next question then was , how are they doing this ?
how are they maintaining it in a particular straight line ?
that was what was of interest to us next .
and it was this particular little behavior , the dance , that we thought was important , because look , it takes a pause every now and then , and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in .
and let 's see what his reaction is as he 's headed through 90 degrees here , and now he 's going to — when he ends up down here , he 's going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction .
we thought that maybe what they 're doing is trying to get off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face to cool their head down .
one was hot , one was cold .
so what you 're looking at here is a heat image of the system , and what you can see here emerging from the poo is a cool dung ball .
watch how often the beetle dances .
it was a dental compound that we used to make these boots .
however , there 's one more story i 'd like to share with you , and that 's this particular species .
if it 's using landmarks , it will find its home .
so there he is there .
well , we know that they can roll balls in a straight line using celestial cues .
i 'm talking simply about the creative intelligence of the bottom-up , whether manifested in the slums of tijuana that build themselves , in fact , with the waste of san diego , or the many migrant neighborhoods in southern california that have begun to be retrofitted with difference in the last decades .
so these are houses waiting to cross the border .
or the garage doors that are brought from san diego in trucks to become the new skin of emergency housing in many of these slums surrounding the edges of tijuana .
i do n't want to romanticize poverty .
i just want to suggest that this informal urbanization is not just the image of precariousness , that informality here , the informal , is really a set of socioeconomic and political procedures that we could translate as artists , that this is about a bottom-up urbanization that performs .
see here , buildings are not important just for their looks , but , in fact , they are important for what they can do .
caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway , so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them .
with this knowledge , these teenagers as skaters confronted the city .
thank you .
( applause )
during the civil war , he and his family were forced to flee to nigeria .
late at night , after work , he surfed the net looking for ways to study .
in large parts of the world , higher education is unattainable for an average citizen .
first , bricks and mortar cost money .
textbooks is also something our students do n't need to buy .
by using open educational resources and the generosity of professors who are putting their material free and accessible , we do n't need to send our students to buy textbooks .
finally , it 's our belief in peer-to-peer learning .
in order to study biofluorescence , we swim at night .
but these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights , and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue .
from deep space , our universe looks like a human brain cell , and then here we are in the deep ocean , and we 're finding marine creatures and cells that can illuminate the human mind .
we see how a handful of patients responds to treatment in a clinical trial , and we bring drugs to a national market .
in each movie , you 're going to see a baby doing maybe just exactly what you might expect a baby to do , and we can hardly make babies more magical than they already are .
you could do that with your eyes closed .
maybe only the blue balls squeak .
first of all , the research is insane .
you know causal relationships . you know about moral reasoning .
i am a gay talking head on fox news .
you 'd totally be surprised .
and let me take you back 100 years to 1912 .
raise your hand if you think you know .
so actually most of the 11 we have are tied up in the mid-east .
that 's not sustainable .
so where do we go from here ?
the slide you 're looking at here is 1990 to 2040 .
and when you look at what we 're using the oil for , 70 percent of it is used for transportation fuel .
the oil is priced off the margin .
run it through the separator and you 're ready to use it .
so you will cut 60 percent off of opec with eight million trucks .
so what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel , is the way i see it .
so there 's nothing going on that impresses me in washington on that plan , other than i 'm trying to focus on that eight million 18-wheelers .
and at the time i went into the wind business , natural gas was nine dollars .
tbp : that 's what happened .
i 'm not a big natural gas producer .
tbp : well you 're going to have to use something .
ca : but i do n't think that 's right , boone .
( laughter ) and number two , do not build a reformer on the ocean .
you 're going to have to have energy . there is no question .
is that a concern ?
tbp : i 'm teasing .
( laughter ) ca : all right , so it 's the bridge fuel .
ca : boone , i really , really appreciate you coming here , engaging in this conversation .
you only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy .
remember fire ?
three together , that 's sparkles .
( laughter ) three women together , be careful , it 's adultery .
they were so used to looking at it from the perspective of this one disease , they could not see the larger implications for another disease .
functional fixedness is a bias that affects all of us .
check out what 's going on .
and we only published this a year ago , but since then other labs have independently confirmed this effect .
we had accidentally discovered the first resilience-enhancing drug .
but it is actually kind of similar to what you see in immune vaccines .
so if we wanted something sooner , ketamine is already fda-approved .
this could be the beginning of the end of the mental health epidemic .
in 2009 , i lost someone i loved very much .
do n't they just pop into your head ?
they 're shocked .
a kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller .
but kids do n't mind .
they get locked in .
our artistic desire does n't go away .
let 's be artists , right now . right away . how ?
( applause )
most of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world .
the idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests is a real problem .
or even not so nicely .
so they organized a general strike , in which people throughout the country refused to work .
when isis captured mosul in june 2014 , they announced that they were putting in place a new public school curriculum , based on their own extremist ideology .
i have about 250 pairs , but trust me , i am small-time .
and now they use the data to do it together .
so nike is definitely not the stock exchange .
you know , when you see a thunderstorm on the horizon and you just find yourself rooting for the storm .
i 'm german myself , so i know exactly what that feels like .
they do n't have meaning . we do .
just see the contrast .
now , these are n't just little points of light , little pixels .
we see here there 's a little man walking along , or maybe a woman .
you can start to see words emerging here .
this is a photographic representation , called snapshots .
i remember i was about 13 , glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents ' living room as soviet tanks rolled into budapest , and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down .
and she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun , put her hand on it and lower it .
how can this be made better ?
`` and you say , `` '' okay , now we 're going back to sleep . ''
`` half-past seven , we 're getting up and that 's what we 're going to do . '' '' i had one of these 3 a.m. episodes on sunday — paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you . ''
if we can put our anger inside an engine , it can drive us forward , it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power .
because at the beginning i was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that i just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong .
it 's bottom-up or grassroots power .
and they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this .
and it 's been translated into 26 languages .
because finally human beings are getting it .
i see evidence everywhere of how it works .
( applause )
but this is only one half of the story .
but there are a lot of challenges for this .
skeletons are ubiquitous ; they 're found all over the place .
mummies are a great source of information , except that they 're really geographically limited and limited in time as well .
it 's a type of fossilized dental plaque that is called officially dental calculus .
but in ancient times before tooth brushing , up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime .
we find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years .
in this country , if you receive stolen goods , are you not prosecuted ?
standard chartered has brought in 140 million .
they are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children 's cleverness .
and it 's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
i was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families .
the newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours , but their demands were not met , and so eventually they learned not to bother . within a few days , they were listless , lethargic , and staring into space like all the others .
at 8 , their nappies must be changed , so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children .
in moldova , young women raised in institutions are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers , and a russian study found that two years after leaving institutions , young adults , 20 percent of them had a criminal record , 14 percent were involved in prostitution , and 10 percent had taken their own lives .
if we know people who are planning to support orphanages , we should convince them to support family services instead .
that is , until just days before the trial , when a curious thing happened .
now , you can see how this could be a problem , especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret .
we are drowning in news .
as we heard yesterday , there 's over a billion people hungry .
britain will starve without genetically modified crops .
and if nasa does n't do it , china might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
my point is this : in the long run , some news stories are more important than others .
but it 's not fine .
there 's nothing to see here .
i sat there wondering what on earth i had gotten myself into .
and that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .
beyond that , i did n't see anyone for 10 weeks .
we 've all seen the photos of the collapsed buildings in haiti .
this is the national palace — the equivalent of the white house .
we have all heard about the tremendous human loss in the earthquake in haiti , but we have n't heard enough about why all those lives were lost .
working with minustah , which is the u.n. mission in haiti , with the ministry of public works , with different ngos , we inspected over 1,500 buildings .
that is 500 times the power of the 7.0 that hit port-au-prince — 500 times the power , yet only under a thousand casualties .
adjusted for population density , that is less than one percent of the impact of the haitian quake .
seismic standards and confined masonry , where the building acts as a whole — walls and columns and roofs and slabs tied together to support each other — instead of breaking off into separate members and failing .
chileans have been building with confined masonry for decades .
to make sure these buildings are safe , it 's not going to take policy — it 's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques .
for the billions spent on reconstruction , you can train masons for dollars on every house that they end up building over their lifetime .
( applause )
in fact , all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating .
listening is an active skill , whereas hearing is passive , listening is something that we have to work at — it 's a relationship with sound .
`` expansive listening , on the other hand , is listening `` '' with , '' '' not listening `` '' for . '' '' it 's got no destination in mind — it 's just enjoying the journey . ''
women typically listen expansively .
it 's a dislocation between what you see and what you hear .
there is a cost of compression .
it 's not good for you in the long run .
we may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
first , ultrasound : we 're very familiar with it from physical therapy ; it 's also now being used to treat cancer .
it 's been around for thousands of years .
secondly , get in touch with making some sound — create sound .
so i 'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound .
so i urge you to take that path .
( music ) ( applause ) thank you .
hi , everybody .
( music ) ( applause ) thank you .
just play your life with all you have , and share it with the world .
anyway , this is a lady creature .
and you kind of walk through them . it 's taking me years .
it goes without saying that it 's really difficult for me to be here today , but my brother deah , his wife yusor , and her sister razan do n't give me much of a choice .
i 'm hopeful that by the end of this talk you will make a choice , and join me in standing up against hate .
i move to the back of the hall and burst into tears .
i walk into my childhood home and faint into my parents ' arms , sobbing .
i know that i have to give my family voice , and i do the only thing i know how : i send a facebook message to everyone i know in media .
we just have to put up with it and smile .
`` he says to me , `` '' we 've done some work around the country . ''
going to scratch his nose .
i 've noticed something interesting about society and culture .
now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon .
these bees spend the majority of their life cycle hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem and very few of these beautiful species have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees .
so in my lab , we study how bees keep themselves healthy .
we 've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant .
in most agricultural settings , on most of our farms , it 's only the seed that 's coated with the insecticide , and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant and gets into the pollen and nectar , and if a bee consumes this lower dose , either nothing happens or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented and she may not find her way home .
it 's this big , blood-sucking parasite that compromises the bee 's immune system and circulates viruses .
at least in the united states , an average of 30 percent of all bee hives are lost every winter .
we need to be really appreciative of all the beekeepers out there . plant flowers .
despite all the technological advances — computers , i.t. , communications , telecommunications , the internet .
now , we try to refine them , we try to combine them .
and every time there is a new requirement , we use the same approach .
we create dedicated structure processed systems , basically to deal with the new complexity of business .
let 's take an example .
you have mr. noise , mr. petrol consumption , mr. anti-collision properties .
so , what was the solution using the hard approach ?
when you design cars , please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages .
when we do n't cooperate we need more time , more equipment , more systems , more teams .
look , at home i have two tvs . why ?
and why i try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because i love my wife .
create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions .
we will cooperate .
( applause )
you walk into sacred rituals , private moments in a village , a town , a group of people .
the respect is stepping forward , not stepping backward , and i really think that by engaging your body in the moment , in the ceremony , in the places , people welcome you and understand your energy .
you do n't do much editing .
just before coming to tedglobal , you have actually been traveling around the country for that .
it 's a very great honor for me to welcome onstage one of the greatest brazilian musicians of all time .
he was taken to another province , where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends .
along with my family , i returned back to quetta .
hazaras are confined into two small areas , and they are marginalized socially , educationally , and financially .
not every asylum seeker is lucky like me .
it is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate , in limbo .
there are terrorists and other serious national security threats that i suspect we all want the fbi and the nsa to monitor .
i want you to use these tools .
if i reach out and pull an object , another neuron will fire , commanding me to pull that object .
for one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .
if you go back in time about [ 75,000 ] to 100,000 years ago , let 's look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago .
and there is whole chains of neurons around this room , talking to each other .
and they would be somethings like saws , knives , sickles and axes that i covered up with a piece of towel .
where ? the rooftop of my apartment building , a place where 96 families call home .
i also researched extensively on bows around the world .
after fixing , breaking , redesigning , mending , bending and amending , my ideal bow began to take shape , and when it was finally done , it looked like this .
this is a picture of korean traditional bows taken from a museum , and see how my bow resembles them .
the new better off is not an individual prospect at all .
if you 're a textbook success , the implications of what i 'm saying could be more grim for you .
you ca n't buy your way out of suffering or into meaning .
but we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple .
thank you .
she 's still there . she 's there this morning , actually .
i used to be a photographer for many years .
and the pictures before were taken in september .
so , my friend gene flew over with his son , tim .
and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly , so during the day i always left the window open .
this is 28 hours later in atlanta . it 's a very long flight .
there was a bird that people liked on the east coast called the heath hen .
it was loved . they tried to protect it . it died anyway .
and the aurochs was like the bison .
the documentation of this animal goes back to the lascaux cave paintings .
thank you .
i 've got a question .
stewart brand : well , the earlier point is we interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct , and many of them were keystone species , and we changed the whole ecosystem they were in by letting them go .
now , there 's the shifting baseline problem , which is , so when these things come back , they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love .
we will get woolly mammoths back .
thank you so much for presenting . sb : thank you .
now these countries , 32 countries , came together under the auspices of the african union and decided to form an organization called the african risk capacity .
so based on all this , there 's also some differentiation on the continent that i want you to know about , because even as the doom and gloom is here , there are some countries — côte d'ivoire , kenya , ethiopia , tanzania and senegal are performing relatively well at the moment .
but what did we do wrong ?
so even though we 've been growing , the structure of the economies has not changed very much .
only about 12 percent of our trade is among ourselves .
our education systems in many countries are broken .
so those are the things that we are not doing right .
now , where do we go from there ?
i believe that the way forward is to learn to manage success .
very often , when people succeed or countries succeed , they forget what made them succeed .
the next thing is focusing with a laser beam on those things we did not do well .
first and foremost is infrastructure .
i see it every day .
people have fought back , and your mother was kidnapped .
but what it means is that when you fight corruption , when you touch the pockets of people who are stealing money , they do n't just keep quiet .
do you find a way to stay on and fight back ?
and that 's all true .
until the mid-1960s , canada followed an explicitly racist immigration policy .
it was an amazing moment , but it was also a scary one .
now , this peña hardly inspired much confidence at first .
that 's what mexico did .
number one , embrace the extreme .
another striking similarity among good problem-solvers is that they 're all pragmatists .
and given the state of the world today , there 's really no other option .
it turns out , all sorts of things .
this is another infill project on the parking lots , this one of an office park outside of washington d.c .
and here i would like to end with a quote by yasmine , one of the four activist women i interviewed in tunisia .
`` `` after you . '' `` oh , no , no . after you . '' ''
( applause )
i do n't really understand this . a lot of mba students do this .
so you can measure the complexity by counting the number of nodes , and the average illustration has between four and eight nodes .
less than that , the drawing seems trivial , but it 's quick to understand , and more than 13 , the drawing produces a feeling of map shock .
it 's too complex .
so what happens then ?
so next time you 're confronted with an interesting challenge , remember what design has to teach us .
and it 's a wonderful thing .
a guy in england called heston blumenthal , he 's developed his avant-garde cuisine .
this is actually the first picture i took in the book .
steaming ought to be faster .
this shaped wok does n't work very well ; this caught fire three times .
here 's our hamburger cutaway .
so you can lavish all the same care , all the same technique , on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish .
`` the new york times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called `` '' the wait for the 30-hour hamburger just got longer . '' '' because our hamburger recipe , our ultimate hamburger recipe , if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff , it does take about 30 hours . ''
and the answer is : no , not really ; we use a machine shop .
so you photograph that in exactly the same position , and then you can substitute in — and that part does use photoshop — just the edges .
in most cases , though , there was no glass .
what happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh !
this is the 30-hour hamburger .
now watch closely . this is popcorn . i 'll explain it here .
the key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of 1,600 .
that 's what 's happening to the water inside that popcorn .
and what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places .
we , all of us , are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from .
now , i 'm going to try a trick , and recreate an experiment from this morning .
alright , one billion stars .
and the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away , and the nearest galaxy to us , 2.5 million light years .
`` well , to quote : `` '' the discovery of intelligent life beyond earth would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism that has plagued our species since its inception . ''
60 percent of the 3,000 families responded .
it turns out hala was a 25-year-old mother to three young children .
she had lived through bombs being dropped in her town ; she had lived through explosions .
could you still be able to care for yourself and for your family ?
when these family needs are prioritized , interventions for children in humanitarian settings will prioritize and recognize the primary role of the family in supporting children .
3:19 .
how did i not know ?
hawa abdi : many people — 20 years for somalia — [ were ] fighting .
deqo mohamed : so as you know , always in a civil war , the ones affected most [ are ] the women and children .
and they are in our backyard .
that 's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people , where 75 percent of them are women and children .
there is no government to protect them .
and as you can see , it 's the women who are carrying the children ; it 's the women who come into the hospitals ; it 's the women [ are ] building the houses .
and we have a school . this is our bright — we opened [ in the ] last two years [ an ] elementary school where we have 850 children , and the majority are women and girls .
we are sharing with them whatever we have .
first rule : there is no clan distinguished and political division in somali society .
that 's why i became a doctor .
and i thought , maybe i can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist .
my sister was different .
and when i saw the people who needed me , i was staying with them to help , because i [ could ] do something for them .
and really when you think [ you ] can not do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
and it was his favorite artwork ever .
he painted a beautiful vermeer .
he had discovered after all that the painting he thought was this was actually that .
it looked the same , but it had a different origin , it was a different artwork .
and when that was discovered , it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum .
many sociologists like veblen and wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we 're snobs , because we 're focused on status .
how do you make children not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk , but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk — to think they taste better ?
they believe mcdonald 's food is tastier , and it leads them to experience it as tastier .
there are now dozens , perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you 're drinking the expensive stuff , it tastes better to you .
( laughter ) it will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are .
sufferers of capgras syndrome believe that the people they love most in the world have been replaced by perfect duplicates .
and in fact , there 's a thriving market in the partially eaten food of beloved people .
( applause ) now this attraction to objects does n't just work for celebrity objects .
each one of us , most people , have something in our life that 's literally irreplaceable , in that it has value because of its history — maybe your wedding ring , maybe your child 's baby shoes — so that if it was lost , you could n't get it back .
`` then we asked them , `` how much would you pay for george clooney 's sweater ? '' ''
in the case of artwork , the history is special indeed .
who here likes the work of jackson pollock ?
because this woman comes up — you see at the end of the video — she comes up .
so it was a series of five painful shocks .
when i was 22 years old , i was lucky enough to find my calling when i fell into making radio stories .
in 1998 , i made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels on the bowery in manhattan .
you sit across from , say , your grandfather for close to an hour and you listen and you talk .
this is 12-year-old joshua littman interviewing his mother , sarah .
sl : and that helped when amy was born , but you are so incredibly special to me and i 'm so lucky to have you as my son .
his mom , sarah , bound them together in a book , and when josh got picked on at school , they would read the letters together .
it 's simply an act of generosity and love .
it 's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered .
most serve a year or two with storycorps traveling the country , gathering the wisdom of humanity .
i 've also learned so much from these interviews .
i 've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen , like this interview between a betting clerk in brooklyn named danny perasa who brought his wife annie to storycorps to talk about his love for her .
slowly and remarkably , they became friends , and when he was finally released from the penitentiary , oshea actually moved in next door to mary .
this is alexis and her daughter lesley .
am : you know , i live this every day now .
i mean , i wish i had a softer voice maybe , but now i walk in love and i try to live that way every day .
and it 's hard and it takes courage , but that 's why we 're alive , right ?
how are we going to do that ? with this .
so we killed this project , too .
they wanted it messy , and we were happy to oblige .
what are we doing ? oh , just hanging out with our grammy . what what !
grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals .
but we need more .
it sounds impossible , but in fact , it was quite true .
but you have to have a device to go up in the trees .
they 're full of sensors .
people from around the world started to send us emails , phone calls .
there 'd been a mistake .
and the audience loved it .
he did n't want to play .
and i think our instinct is also wrong .
some of carson 's undergraduate subjects struggled with that .
let 's talk about complexity science .
you ca n't solve that kind of problem all in one go , it 's too hard .
and you may know him , he 's actually a ted-ster .
well , he makes a mess .
these cards are disruptive .
( laughter ) so phil collins was playing drums on an early brian eno album .
let me start by telling you a little story .
so i spent time with vivian , and i saw that she did n't find joy in cleaning toilets .
in the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11 , san francisco bay area hotels went through the largest percentage revenue drop in the history of american hotels .
one of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect , and that is that we 're all human .
so i realized in that dotcom crash that my role in life was to channel abe maslow .
we started asking our customers , did they feel an emotional connection with us , in one of seven different kinds of ways .
miraculously , as we asked these questions and started giving attention higher up the pyramid , what we found is we created more loyalty .
so i started asking myself the question : how can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible ?
if we 're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure , and all we can measure is the tangible in life , we 're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid .
it was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my ceo hat off for a week and fly off to the himalayan peaks .
`` he said the following , he said : `` '' why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product ? ''
`` why do n't we care more about gross national happiness ? '' '' now , in essence , the king was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success , what has come to be known as gnh , or gross national happiness . ''
for the next three dozen years as king , this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in bhutan — including , just recently , taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed , no coup .
as i spent my week up in the himalayas , i started to imagine what i call an emotional equation .
( laughter ) the reality is , in western countries , quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out — an object that we 're supposed to get , or maybe many objects .
( applause ) certainly robert kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that .
why in the heck in america are we doing a census in 2010 ?
we 're asking 10 simple questions — it is simplicity .
( laughter ) we 've been fooled by our tool .
and our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century industrial-era model of success .
they are n't the same .
this is dave arringdale who 's actually been a longtime guest at vivian 's motel .
he stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years , and he 's loyal to the property because of the relationship that vivian and her fellow employees have created with him .
in fact , inspired employees quite often help make sizable profits , right ?
so what the world needs now , in my opinion , is business leaders and political leaders who know what to count .
he died a week later .
it has to do with a gallon of milk , with college tuition .
and , more often than not , they die sooner .
we maintained their value , their quality .
palliative care is a paradigm from diagnosis through the end of life .
the hours , weeks , months , years , across a continuum — with treatment , without treatment .
meet christine .
we have the honor and pleasure of jonathan and his father joining us here today .
the group with palliative care reported less pain , less depression .
this is a space that we will all come to at some point .
what we know , what we have proven , is that this conversation needs to happen today — not next week , not next year .
so , starting with the political philosophy .
as it went off , i took off and safely got to the other side .
just then , over my shout , i heard something else , a familiar rattle .
so let me step back and set the stage a little bit .
the surgery was successful .
in particular , i thought about my dad , who had passed away from complications from brain surgery .
my son still had his dad .
i knew there had to be all sorts of systems and techniques and training to have to live a full and meaningful , active life without sight .
it 's like a whole new world of sensory information opens up to you .
and i do n't know who 's watching who , but i have a suspicion that a lot of people are watching me .
and i 'm not paranoid , but everywhere i go , i 'm getting all sorts of advice : go here , move there , watch out for this .
a lot of the information is good .
you 've got to figure out what they actually meant .
`` `` bless you , man . '' ''
i did n't get that sighted .
often it 's thought that that 's an emotion that comes up out of pity .
if you design a city with the blind in mind , sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous .
and we looked at three different types of rooms .
we looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated , where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable , but they made them operable for our study .
but being less diverse is not necessarily good for our health .
so to understand why this was the case , we took our data and put it into an ordination diagram , which is a statistical map that tells you something about how related the microbial communities are in the different samples .
and this is because we 're all constantly shedding microbes .
so all of you right now are sharing your microbes with one another .
it 's a 100 percent open rate even if she does n't respond to you when you ask her when she 's coming home for dinner .
we 've also found an unintended consequence .
we 've been getting text messages back like these .
`` `` '' i do n't want to go to school today . ''
but the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
so think about a cop .
this is really , to me , the power of texting and the power of data .
not anymore .
porous , nonporous .
so very small , but very useful .
you can see the difference .
`` everyone that sees this gets excited , and says , `` oh , i could use it for this and this and this . '' ''
it could be anti-bacterial .
it 's happening !
generation after generation of veterans have chosen not to talk about their experiences , and suffer in solitude .
i could talk to you about it right now if i wanted to , because it unlocked it .
thank you .
people are n't close or distant .
would we see 544 greyhound bus drivers ?
shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade .
so i wanted to open my own eyes to my own sea blindness , so i ran away to sea .
containerization has made it very efficient .
so most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time .
they 're at sea for months at a time , and even when they 're on board , they do n't have access to what a five-year-old would take for granted , the internet .
now how is that possible ?
and that was also shocking , because suddenly , i realized , as the captain said to me , that i had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship .
not all of them , but some of them were , because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners , it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience .
in terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile , it emits about a thousandth of aviation and about a tenth of trucking .
there are interesting initiatives going on .
i also traveled to cape cod to look at the plight of the north atlantic right whale , because this to me was one of the most surprising things about my time at sea , and what it made me think about .
thank you .
there 's two reasons why people do n't do things .
it 's a rainy , stormy , windy day , and people are getting sick on the boat , and i 'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit , and i 'm looking out the window in pure terror thinking i 'm about to swim to my death .
they are 100 percent in our control .
no one can tell you you ca n't learn about yourself .
because i imagine a world where 80 percent of people love the work they do .
`` liespotters are n't those nitpicky kids , those kids in the back of the room that are shouting , `` '' gotcha ! gotcha ! ''
`` i watch that tv show 'lie to me . ' i know you 're lying . '' '' no , liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge of how to spot deception . ''
now not all lies are harmful .
`` so sorry . '' '' but there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception . ''
the rest of us , we 're only 54 percent accurate .
we all chatter with our fingertips .
do n't overdo the botox ; nobody will think you 're honest .
they 're going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth .
that person may be withdrawn , look down , lower their voice , pause , be kind of herky-jerky .
we 're human beings .
that bothers me the most .
and she fought , and i know she fought you .
and i do n't understand it , and i never will .
( applause )
it represents hope . it represents potential .
tom 's hand . tom 's hand . tom 's hand . ( laughter ) anyway .
i have walked through your towns and , while looking , failed to see .
i looked but did n't see .
i listened only when you moved toward shattering continental unions and electing vulgar demagogues .
and the more fundamentalist i became in my worship of change and openness , the more i drove you towards the other polarity , to cling , to freeze , to close , to belong .
yet before you could finish a complaining sentence about the difficulty of living with erratic hours , volatile pay , vanishing opportunities , about the pain of dropping your children off at 24-hour day care to make your 3am shift , i shot back at you — before you could finish your sentence — my dogma , about how what you are actually experiencing was flexibility and freedom .
i have condescended to you with the idea that you are voting against your economic interests — voting against your interests , as if i know your interests .
there may be even talk of war in places that were certain they were done with it .
we face a problem of your and my relations .
we can do this only if we first accept that we have neglected each other .
the angiogenesis foundation is following almost 300 companies , and there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline .
the great inequality in developing countries makes it difficult to see , for example , that in terms of transport , an advanced city is not one where even the poor use cars , but rather one where even the rich use public transport .
it 's a very powerful principle .
for example , if that is true , a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one .
in fact , when i became mayor , applying that democratic principle that public good prevails over private interest , that a bus with 100 people has a right to 100 times more road space than a car , we implemented a mass transit system based on buses in exclusive lanes .
it is a very difficult battle .
a city could find oil or diamonds underground and it would not be so valuable as road space .
in the next 50 years , more than half of those cities which will exist in the year 2060 will be built .
and of course this is just a glimpse of something which could be much better if we just create it , and it changes the way of life .
and of course it 's very difficult to have mass transit or to use bicycles in such environments .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that 's me .
but , but , you know what ?
1,000 , very good .
i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs. drucker .
`` in fact , so lacking in confidence was i that i actually asked the nurse who was looking after mrs. drucker , `` do you think it 's okay if she goes home ? '' ''
`` and the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly , `` '' yeah , i think she 'll do okay . '' '' i can remember that like it was yesterday . ''
and the emerg . staff pulled out all the stops .
and i went through this roller coaster , because after they stabilized her , she went to the intensive care unit , and i hoped against hope that she would recover .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resigned themselves to what was happening .
and it was what i was feeling .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
in this country , as many as 24,000 canadians die of preventable medical errors .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
she 's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
no expensive staff time required .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist 's clinic to do it .
so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .
we see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity .
you do n't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
what are you going to get out of those samples ?
but darwin does n't only explain the evolution of a single idea .
each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay , and it was the imperfections that people cherished .
mira nair : in this little town , there were like 2,000 temples .
what words look like , where paragraphs break , where lines break . i mean , i was n't so badly dyslexic that i was disabled from reading . i just had to do it really slowly , and as i did , lingering on those sentences as i had to linger , i fell heir to language 's other qualities , which i think has helped me write sentences .
artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do , sometimes pushing into what they ca n't do , helps them focus on finding their own voice .
while he was there , he traveled to madrid , where he went to the prado to see this picture by the spanish painter diego velázquez .
that 's a tough space to stand in .
`` the educator parker palmer calls it `` '' the tragic gap , '' '' tragic not because it 's sad but because it 's inevitable , and my friend dick nodel likes to say , `` '' you can hold that tension like a violin string and make something beautiful . '' '' that tension resonates in the work of the photographer joel meyerowitz , who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography , for capturing a moment on the street , and also for his beautiful photographs of landscapes — of tuscany , of cape cod , of light . ''
joel is a new yorker , and his studio for many years was in chelsea , with a straight view downtown to the world trade center , and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light .
jm : well , you know , ugly , i mean , powerful and tragic and horrific and everything , but it was also as , in nature , an enormous event that was transformed after the fact into this residue , and like many other ruins — you go to the ruins of the colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace — and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather .
how can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help ?
em : right . there 's two elements to that answer .
one is that , even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars , you 're still better off .
and the reason is , in the stationary power plant , you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more , is voluminous , and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source .
so in effect , even after you 've taken transmission loss into account and everything , even using the same source fuel , you 're at least twice as better off charging an electric car , then burning it at the power plant .
ca : that scale delivers efficiency .
in fact , we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack .
ca : i mean , those battery packs are incredibly heavy , but you think the math can still work out intelligently — by combining light body , heavy battery , you can still gain spectacular efficiency .
em : exactly . the rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack , and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range .
you can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness .
ca : i mean , this is a beautiful but expensive car .
is there a road map where this becomes a mass-market vehicle ?
em : there actually are far more charging stations than people realize , and at tesla we developed something called a supercharging technology , and we 're offering that if you buy a model s for free , forever .
by the end of this year , you 'll be able to drive from l.a. to new york just using the supercharger network , which charges at five times the rate of anything else .
so it 's common — do n't expect to be out of here in 10 minutes .
it 's actually better to drive for about maybe 160 , 170 miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going .
that 's the natural cadence of a trip .
most people choose to lease .
ca : so your current proposition to consumers is , do n't pay so much up front .
em : well , essentially , solarcity raises a chunk of capital from say , a company or a bank .
with that capital , solarcity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment , which is less than the utility bill .
em : exactly . what it amounts to is a giant distributed utility .
i think it 's a good thing , because utilities have been this monopoly , and people have n't had any choice .
ca : and you really picture a future where a majority of power in america , within a decade or two , or within your lifetime , it goes solar ?
you 'd made some money from the sale of paypal .
`` and they 'd look at me , like , `` '' is he serious ? '' '' ca : and strangely , you were . so what happened ? ''
em : it was a close call . things almost did n't work out .
we came very close to failure , but we managed to get through that point in 2008 .
but the big innovation is still ahead , and you 're working on it now . tell us about this .
ca : wow . reusable rockets.em : yes . ( applause ) and so what a lot of people do n't realize is , the cost of the fuel , of the propellant , is very small .
so we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization .
and we 've had some good tests .
how on earth has one person been able to innovate in this way ?
what is it about you ?
you bet your fortune on it , and you seem to have done that multiple times .
it is truly amazing what you 've done .
physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive , like quantum mechanics .
this may sound like simple advice , but hardly anyone does that , and it 's incredibly helpful .
ca : boys and girls watching , study physics .
it 's a difficult place to work in .
our bodies are home to trillions of microbes , and these creatures define who we are .
the microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods .
i 'm going to share data with you from one aspect of my research focused on architecture that demonstrates how , through both conscious and unconscious design , we 're impacting these invisible worlds .
this perspective is a really powerful one for designers , because you can bring on principles of ecology , and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal , the way organisms move around .
they do this using principles of physics and chemistry , but they could also be using biology .
i am collaborating with charlie brown .
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quantitative way how his design choices impacted the ecology and biology of this building , he got really excited , because it added a new dimension to what he did .
he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health .
when you walked into those rooms , they smelled really bad , and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before .
contrast this to rooms that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy where air came in from the outside through louvers .
a conscious approach to design , i 'm calling it bioinformed design , and i think it 's possible .
and there is a lake scene in the south polar region of titan .
`` and in my lab , i was studying the widower effect , which is a very old idea in the social sciences , going back 150 years , known as `` '' dying of a broken heart . '' '' so , when i die , my wife 's risk of death can double , for instance , in the first year . ''
so , if you look at this image , right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non-obese people in the image .
it says that , if your friends are obese , your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher .
and the last possibility is what is known as confounding , because it confounds our ability to figure out what 's going on .
here , what 's spreading from person to person is not a behavior , but rather a norm : an idea is spreading .
`` blame your fat friends . '' '' ( laughter ) what was interesting to us is that the european headline writers had a different take : they said , `` are your friends gaining weight ? perhaps you are to blame . '' ( laughter ) ''
`` and we thought this was a very interesting comment on america , and a kind of self-serving , `` '' not my responsibility '' '' kind of phenomenon . ''
and this was complicated because we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure , the architecture of the ties , was changing across time .
and , not only can they read them , but they copy them .
and notice first of all — so , to understand this , though , we need to dissect network structure a little bit first — and notice that every person in this network has exactly the same structural location as every other person .
but that 's not the case with real networks .
if you look here at the dots , compare node b in the upper left to node d in the far right ; b has four friends coming out from him and d has six friends coming out from him .
this is known as transitivity in networks .
for instance , 47 percent in the variation in whether your friends know each other is attributable to your genes .
and so some people knit together the networks around them , creating a kind of dense web of ties in which they 're comfortably embedded .
and finally , we even found that 30 percent of the variation in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network can also be attributed to their genes .
they 're both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way — on the left — and you get graphite , which is soft and dark .
if i was always violent towards you or gave you misinformation or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs , you would cut the ties to me , and the network would disintegrate .
and of course , we 've changed the chemistry of the air .
humans have just been involved in nature in a very influential way for a very long time .
`` now , just recently , someone told me , `` oh , but there are still wild places . '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' where ? where ? i want to go . '' '' and he said , `` '' the amazon . '' '' and i was like , `` '' oh , the amazon . i was just there . ''
people live there , and they do n't just float over the jungle .
so to deal with this , the park service has been planting rust-resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park , even in areas that they are otherwise managing as wilderness .
there are so many rules and restrictions that from a child 's point of view , this is , like , the worst nature ever .
additionally , these sort of edenic places are often distant from where people live .
and they 're expensive to get to . they 're hard to visit .
and this is crazy . this is just patently false .
this is an ecosystem , a functioning ecosystem .
there 's pollination going on .
for so long , we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as trash .
( applause )
`` this is a typical pathway in rocinha called a `` '' beco '' '' — these are how you get around the community . ''
forty-three .
but we wanted to make the economic case , because if we could make the economic case , then the value of doing this would be completely compelling .
the idea is called the social impact bond .
and the investors do not just get their money back , but they make a return .
but there are great programs for adolescents who are on the edge of care , and 30 percent of kids going into care are adolescents .
so we set up a program with essex county council to test out intensive family therapeutic support for those families with adolescents on the edge of the care system .
why is this so different for people ?
the second piece it brings is rigor .
the last element is partnership .
we 've met thousands , possibly millions of people , who want the opportunity to invest in social change .
after some time , however , we had a tentative answer .
on march 14 , this year , i posted this poster on facebook .
i will try to explain to you about the context of why and when i posted .
we have this war with iran coming for 10 years now , and we have people , you know , afraid .
it 's like , if we do n't act now , it 's too late forever , for 10 years now .
we do n't know people from iran .
the day after , when really it became a lot of talking , i said to myself , and my wife said to me , i also want a poster , so this is her . ( laughter ) because it 's working , put me in a poster now .
`` it 's not just one dude making one poster , it 's — we can be part of it , so they start sending me pictures and ask me , `` '' make me a poster . post it . ''
it was a huge amount of pictures .
`` ( `` '' you are my first israelian friend . i wish we both get rid of our idiot politicians , anyway nice to see you ! '' '' ) ( `` '' i love that blue . i love that star . i love that flag . '' '' ) this one is really moving for me because it 's the story of a girl who has been raised in iran to walk on an israeli flag to enter her school every morning , and now that she sees the posters that we 're sending , she starts — she said that she changed her mind , and now she loves that blue , she loves that star , and she loves that flag , talking about the israeli flag , ''
so you can see they are still shy , they do n't want to show their faces , but they want to spread the message .
`` and suddenly , there is something that was happening that was good news . so the guys on the news , they say , `` '' okay , let 's talk about this . '' '' and they just came , and it was so much , i remember one day , michal , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , `` who 's gon na see the show ? `` and he said , `` everybody . '' ''
because you 're not in the middle east .
`` you 're somewhere over there , and then you want to see the middle east , so you go on google and you say , `` '' israel , '' '' and they give you the bad stuff . ''
so for five months now , that 's what we are doing , me , michal , a few of my friends , are just making images .
they see images of us , and they see bad images .
this is the enemy .
what ?
and at some point , you become friends on facebook , and you become friends in life .
`` now people from iran , the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent , you know , their foot and half their faces , now they 're sending their faces , and they 're saying , `` okay , no problem , we 're into it . we are with you . '' ''
crazy , yes ?
i would eventually fail every test for mental awareness .
i had no dreams , no hope , nothing to look forward to .
i was a silent , invisible observer of how people behaved when they thought no one was watching .
how could they do this to me ?
what had i done to deserve this ?
i just never knew when .
i remember one particularly low moment .
i taught myself to tell the time by noticing where the shadows were .
it was exhilarating , but frustrating at times .
( laughter ) but not all , a few are still alive .
i think that ship has sailed , it 's too late for me .
it was my favorite show , even before it paid for my house .
but that 's what i was doing .
i do n't think they know that , luckily , but i would go back and play for arby 's coupons .
there was no software that could compete at this kind of arena .
and i realized , this is it .
there was a big watson logo in the middle of the stage .
i do n't want to spoil it , if you still have this sitting on your dvr , but watson won handily .
and it has n't been the last .
so it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be .
i 've read economists saying that , as a result of these new technologies , we 'll enter a new golden age of leisure when we 'll all have time for the things we really love because all these onerous tasks will be taken over by watson and his digital brethren .
and suddenly there was a machine that did that , and now we do n't need to remember that anymore .
the more i thought about it , i realized , no , it 's still important .
there 's just too much .
do i take this job or that one ?
and you 'll make a less informed decision .
she was a 10-year-old girl from surrey , england on vacation with her parents a few years ago in phuket , thailand .
that 's often the advantage of time .
these know-it-alls , they 're not rainman-style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book .
this is the landscape of one medicine .
ca : post-napster , you 're looking like a bit of a genius , actually , for that as well .
ca : so , just help us with some of the numbers .
do you like to be called sir richard , or how ?
but he 's an absolute genius when it comes to design .
ca : but you did n't have him design the engine ?
rb : philippe is quite erratic , so i think that he would n't be the best person to design the engine , no .
rb : in fact , i think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying , you know , come on , richard , there are better ways of crossing the atlantic .
ca : you did n't turn out too bad , i have to say , i 'm ...
and i actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well , and i like to think that 's how we run virgin .
and so we spend a very good sort of three months away together .
and they moved their bodies and they came forward , and the lights bounced off these costumes .
but it 's very easy to climb up , is it not ?
now the americans in the audience will know all about cup stacking .
but security is tight at all the shops . every day there are more and more cops .
`` and in 1996 , i found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named reg e. gaines , who wrote the famous poem , `` '' please do n't take my air jordans . '' '' and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ? ''
`` i wanted to know which poet he read , and i landed on a poem called [ `` '' dark prophecy : sing of shine '' '' ] , a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be : broadway , baby . ''
so i went in the bookstore . and i found tim 's book .
i did n't think much about it .
it 's not very pleasant , but it 's better than getting eaten .
but they 've also created — they 've also produced three times the disability rates .
if you 're in the military and you 're in a lot of combat , you 're no more likely to kill yourself than if you were n't .
and maybe what determines the rate of long-term ptsd is n't what happened out there , but the kind of society you come back to .
modern society has probably produced the highest rates of suicide and depression and anxiety and loneliness and child abuse ever in human history .
i saw one study that compared women in nigeria , one of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt and poorest countries in africa , to women in north america .
that was also the wealthiest group .
and then they come home and they have to give all that up and they 're coming back to a society , a modern society , which is hard on people who were n't even in the military .
but a lot of them — maybe what 's bothering them is actually a kind of alienation .
these people are in danger .
the israeli military has a ptsd rate of around one percent .
the suicide rate went down .
a solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy .
and this instrument shows something at the moment .
i was impressed and amazed by the kids of manshiyat naser .
and then when you get to a station , it 's expanded so that you can actually read it .
my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life .
on top of that , they 're all very expensive , costing hundreds of dollars per kit .
this statistic might look familiar if you walked into a high school robotics club , or a college engineering class .
so how do we start to change the perception of technology ?
so take a look at this tutorial .
`` and there is such a thing as international law , so there is no way you can say , `` '' i take 10,000 and that 's finished . '' '' i remind you of one thing : in turkey , at the beginning of the crisis , i remember one minister saying , `` turkey will be able to receive up to 100,000 people . '' ''
so i do n't think it 's fair to say how many we can take .
that reflects the general underfunding of the organizations working on these issues .
country by country , international organizations , the european union ?
who should be coming up with this support ?
bg : have the recent attacks in paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult ?
and i think that is part of daesh 's strategy to make europe react , closing its doors to muslim refugees and having an hostility towards muslims inside europe , exactly to facilitate daesh 's work .
bg : question : you are stepping down from your job at the end of the year , after 10 years .
last year , we helped 124,000 .
`` if i had to say something to him , it would be , `` '' be yourself , and do your best . '' '' bg : commissioner , thank you for the job you do . ''
landscape was not enough .
for women : self-confidence , empowerment .
that 's who i truly am , just fighting for people .
here 's the first example .
so even in the situation that does n't look as bad as this , it 's still affecting the amount of time these animals have to do their normal work .
i 'm a relationship builder .
recently , we were asked to design a center for social justice leadership called the arcus center .
and everybody wanted the work of social justice to be visible to the outside world .
and now the central space works for big social gatherings and a place to meet one-on-one for the very first time .
how can we know ?
now , just by being able to go outside on your balcony or on the third floor roof terrace , you can be connected to the outdoors , even when you 're way above the ground plane .
and equity is the key issue here .
you know , in my field , there 's a debate about whether architecture can even do anything to improve social relationships .
i wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me for strangers , and tucked them all throughout the city , dozens and dozens of them . i left them everywhere , in cafes and in libraries , at the u.n. , everywhere .
i blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary , and i posed a kind of crazy promise to the internet : that if you asked me for a hand-written letter , i would write you one , no questions asked .
i was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate , which is a conversation starter , let me tell you .
we still clutch close these letters to our chest , to the words that speak louder than loud , when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to sisters and brothers and even to strangers , for far too long .
in real life , i love to hike , but every time i want to go on a hike , it makes me nervous .
it 's a large canister filled with bomblets .
he was born in the rashidieh camp for palestinian refugees , and this is where he still lives .
the high medical cost is a burden to the families .
but some of the biggest producers of cluster munitions — namely , the united states , russia and china — remain outside of this lifesaving treaty and continue to produce them , reserve the right to produce them in the future , keep those harmful weapons in their stockpiles and even possibly use them in the future .
`` when i ask him if it 's safe to work in the field he said , `` i 'm not sure . '' ''
culturally , he 's expected to provide for his family , but he simply ca n't .
shakespeare being seven ?
( laughter ) yeah ?
public bathrooms .
she 'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem , and that problem started with her and was hers alone .
so i asked her to tell me the story of what had happened , asked her to tell me how it made her feel .
`` `` mad and sad , '' she told me . ''
`` i said , `` '' yes , until you can get home . '' '' she seemed to take some comfort in that . ''
so let 's just do it .
we ca n't change transphobic minds overnight , but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work making the world safer for all of us .
chris anderson : the rights of citizens , the future of the internet .
and this really is the crucial insight .
and then we have a chicken .
thank you very much .
yet , it 's 160 years old .
so we turn to the field of vaccines .
one is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses .
and there 's about 4,000 projections on this particular square compared to the needle .
now , if we take a step back and think about these other two really important advantages : one is improved immune responses through delivery , and the second is getting rid of the cold chain .
you can see immediately that we have those projections in the skin .
but you can immediately see that the nanopatch achieves that penetration indeed .
the world of vaccines is getting better .
if we 're above that line it 's considered protective ; if we 're below that line it 's not .
let 's consider the big three : hiv , malaria , tuberculosis .
many of them are old , like this one in port moresby , many of them are breaking down and many are not in the highlands where they are required .
but also , papua new guinea has the world 's highest incidence of hpv , human papillomavirus , the cervical cancer [ risk factor ] .
thank you .
and then , as the other axis kicks in , those actually blur into a volume .
at the time i made this picture , stacey was working as an attorney for the state of texas .
so as part of this project , i thought it 'd be interesting if she tried to meet someone .
`` participants were given a list of ice- breaker questions to get the ball rolling , things like , `` '' if you could be any kind of animal , what would you be ? '' '' that sort of thing . ''
mike asked me a hypothetical question .
there 's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk , is there ?
first of all , because we ca n't shape what we do n't understand , and what we do n't understand and use ends up shaping us .
two scientists at university of illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink .
so amongst hannah 's many impressive experiments , this is one of my favorites .
but paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics .
so hannah 's artisanal work , and the fact that she shared her findings , opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative .
so we started looking around for new , innovative teaching methods , but what we found was quite disappointing .
and so we thought to ourselves : why not just apply that to science ?
and what they did is split the students into two groups .
and today , i am really excited to be presenting what we came up with and have been working incredibly hard to create .
do you see me up on the screen ?
and when jack shares his story of how he did this huge breakthrough , he also explains that one thing almost prevented him from making this breakthrough .
you are noora the light .
jabbar : then what about the rest of us ?
jabbar : we 're here to help you .
as the father of five sons , i worry about who they 're going to be using as role models .
it 's the most powerful thing you own .
is this just the way the world is ?
but you will also notice something else about this map .
`` now , some of you might be saying at this moment in time , `` oh yeah , but ok , hang on a second there ... nutt . '' ''
well , you notice that , in fact , that also goes up roughly three- to fourfold .
you know , the curbing of small arms — it 's not going to solve the problem of war .
and it 's up to all of us who live in those rich countries to make change here .
what should i actually try to replicate ?
and ted talks — ted talks are where everybody has great ideas .
the inequalities in sport are breathtaking .
i think they are a cancer of the soul .
too often , i think history 's what i call the mount rushmore model .
seven . ok. seven . that 's all right , i suppose .
the army ranger who trained them had served 12 deployments .
and women can be heroes , too .
what you may not be familiar with is that google glass is a device that will allow you to see what i see .
it will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field .
i have to create a framework that you then fill in with your imagination .
now , i have some footage to show you of what it 's like to wear google glass underneath the helmet to give you a taste of that .
she was so appalled by what was happening in austria as a result of the first world war and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of austria , that in britain she wanted to take action , but she had to go house to house , leaflet to leaflet , to get people to attend a rally in the royal albert hall that eventually gave birth to save the children , an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world .
we have now , and are the first generation with , the power to do this .
one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda .
take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world .
how did he die ?
this goes to the fundamental problem we have with vaccine development for infectious diseases .
we also need to do a better job at being able to figure out which are the diseases that most threaten us .
and vaccines are our best defense .
mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist .
still worse , when it comes to some forms of cancer , such as ovarian , liver or pancreatic cancer , good screening methods simply do n't exist , meaning that often people wait until physical symptoms surface , which are themselves already indicators of late-stage progression .
the net result is a complete separation of these two particle populations .
we shall prevail .
the american political cartoonist mark fiore also had his satire application censored in the united states because some of apple 's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups .
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the egyptian security forces .
this has a chilling effect on people 's ability to use the internet to hold government accountable .
so we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the internet , which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services .
so the important question , i think , is not this debate over whether the internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys .
so the question is , we know how to hold government accountable .
we need to make the same approach with the internet .
so now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked .
but it 's going to require innovation that 's not only going to need to focus on politics , on geopolitics , but it 's also going to need to deal with questions of business management , investor behavior , consumer choice and even software design and engineering .
you know , white , brown , whatever — i loved them all .
and i was certainly not going to be killed for something that was n't even my dream — it was my father 's choice .
our lives , our dreams , our future does not belong to us , it belongs to our parents and their community .
she was obedient , she did whatever her parents wanted .
the police did n't believe her so they did n't do anything .
what i am trying to say is that we have to understand why some of our young people are attracted to this .
having said that , i did not choose destruction , i chose to pick up a camera instead of a gun .
i could see that understanding is the answer , instead of violence .
and to our young people tempted by extremism , can you acknowledge that your rage is fueled by pain ?
can you see that the sweetest revenge is for you to live a happy , full and free life ?
thank you for listening .
now , what theories do we want to use to look at this ?
so why exhibit my work in the ocean ?
purple sponges breathe water like air .
and what do you see here ?
well , when i got there , it was packed .
your pupils dilate , your muscles contract , your spidey sense tingles , basically your whole body is trigger-happy . ( laughter ) that condition is not conducive to performing folk music . ( laughter )
and i wanted more . but i knew i had to get past this nervousness .
and then i could move on , and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease .
and eventually , over time , i did n't have to play the stage fright song at all .
( applause ) can i have a sip of water ?
so that suggests that somewhere in these genes , somewhere in the dna , are genes for aging , genes that allow them to have different lifespans .
so we 've set out to look for genes that control aging .
and next you 're going to see the long-lived mutant when it 's young .
the animal 's clearly in the nursing home .
one gene is changed out of 20,000 , and look at it .
but it 's really more like this : let 's say you 're a 30 year-old guy — or in your 30s — and you 're a bachelor and you 're dating people .
and you meet someone you really like , you get to know her .
well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants , a whole lot of genes are switched on in the dna that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues , and repair damage .
and the immune system is more active .
these animals have within them the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do .
so it ca n't turn the genes on .
and they all come and they fortify the house .
and that means that , maybe if we tweak it a little bit , we can increase the health and longevity of people .
a foxo is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people .
there are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging .
it is a drug for people , but the reason is it suppresses the immune system .
thank you .
so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .
and i think that 's much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
and also , there are other ways of activating foxo that do n't even involve insulin or igf-1 that might even be safer .
just move to one side for us , if you would .
and they grow to be about this size .
it 's more like , say , if you were a dog .
but now we 're the human looking out and imagining a different human .
( applause )
i want to talk to you about one of the biggest myths in medicine , and that is the idea that all we need are more medical breakthroughs and then all of our problems will be solved .
we need to shine light to see what we 're doing .
so nowadays in the operating room , we no longer need to use sunlight .
we have an opportunity to bring in other kinds of lights — lights that can allow us to see what we currently do n't see .
this is how we excise cancers .
we 've made a good job . we 've taken it out .
that 's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient 's on the table .
so would n't it be better if we could really tell , if the surgeon could really tell , whether or not there 's still cancer on the surgical field ?
the first one is a polyanionic segment , which basically acts as a non-stick backing like the back of a sticker .
i could n't when i was working on this .
the light that the fluorescence emits can go through tissue .
it does n't tell you whether or not the gas station has gas .
anesthesiologists , surgeons are waiting around .
well with our technology , the surgeon is able to tell immediately which nodes have cancer .
well you can see this on an mri .
but equally important is to preserve things that are important for function .
that 's a lot of people to have a lot of problems — and this is even in so-called nerve-sparing surgery , which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem , and they are trying to avoid the nerves .
they are traced just by their known anatomical path along vasculature .
and he brought his whole team with him .
we have been able to see nerves for facial expression , for facial movement , for breathing — every single nerve — nerves for urinary function around the prostate .
do you know where it 's going ?
`` they said , `` '' wow ! ''
the eventual goal is that we 'll get this into patients .
we know that this can be done and we 're committed to doing it .
and that is the light that i want to shine on health and medicine today .
and let 's look at another map .
now , doctors and nurses — they too get trained .
and the audience for such a long time was in a position where they did n't have any way of affecting news or making any change . they could n't really connect .
to give an example of how we rely on the audience , on the 5th of september in costa rica , an earthquake hit .
so it 's an interesting position to be in as a journalist , because we should have access to everything .
and nowhere was this brought home more than during hurricane sandy . so what you had in hurricane sandy was a superstorm , the likes of which we had n't seen for a long time , hitting the iphone capital of the universe — ( laughter ) — and you got volumes of media like we 'd never seen before .
and how do you build a list like that from scratch ?
you do n't know if it 's a scrape . you do n't know if it 's a re-upload .
but we started looking , and we used free internet tools to do so .
and we went back to google maps , and we looked a little bit closer , and sure enough , there 's the white lilo , there are the two trees , there 's the umbrella . it 's actually folded in this photo .
syria has been really interesting for us , because obviously a lot of the time you 're trying to debunk stuff that can be potentially war crime evidence , so this is where youtube actually becomes the most important repository of information about what 's going on in the world .
and we get to hama . we get all the way from the dam to hama and there 's no bridge .
so this could be our bridge . and we zoom right in .
they 're yes or no , they 're black or white .
my name is emiliano salinas and i 'm going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now .
it will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons .
corruption ? poverty ? or is it something else ?
and let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear — and this is the second level of civil response : fear .
so streets become more desolate and unsafe , so we stay home more — which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe , and we stay home even more .
we need to move mexican society , the members of society who are at this level , to the next level , which is action .
`` let 's do something about it . '' '' recently — this is a sensitive figure — 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in mexico . ''
usually it 's one or two a year .
and for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head .
they just have to raise their hands .
i 've traveled a lot and nowhere else have i found the passion mexicans have .
the passion with which we 've been singing the national anthem since we were kids .
a mother is the most sacred thing in life .
they can take a man 's life .
it 's the user reviews .
but what does that mean ?
the community came up with a solution , called multi-signature escrow payments .
just recently , the musician aphex twin released his album as a dark net site .
actually , for 10 years .
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
thank you .
you just have to find another term and look that up .
maybe it rains .
but now today , it 's no longer impractical .
we have the tools to do it .
to appreciate what we 're talking about and the tragedy of lost potential here , i 'd like to give a little bit of a thought experiment .
we 're exiting what you could call the industrial age and we 're going into this information revolution .
in the middle of the pyramid , you had an information processing , a bureaucracy class , and at the top of the pyramid , you had your owners of capital and your entrepreneurs and your creative class .
it 's made of silcon-coated glass fiber .
and so we could n't really touch its surfaces .
i could n't understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
and that was when i had the idea .
there was no starting point for peace .
so he was like my hero .
and we wrote to heads of state , their ambassadors , nobel peace laureates , ngos , faiths , various organizations — literally wrote to everybody .
and very quickly , some letters started coming back .
there were 114 people there — they were mostly my friends and family .
for me , it was really about the process .
i 'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry , their art , their literature , their music , their sport , whatever it might be .
and i was waiting for him to come down , and i knew that he was on his way .
it never happened .
it 's just symbolism .
`` i 'd spoken in somalia , burundi , gaza , the west bank , india , sri lanka , congo , wherever it was , and they 'd all tell me , `` '' if you can create a window of opportunity , we can move aid , we can vaccinate children . ''
we started moving around the corridors of the u.n. system , governments and ngos , trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it , see if we could make it possible .
`` and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it , and i was thinking , `` '' this is it . this is the possibility of it maybe working . ''
and maybe we 'd be helped financially a little bit more , which had been desperately difficult .
so these guys were absolutely crucial .
and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
and i got home , and i remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the taliban .
we went back to afghanistan , because the next year was coming , and we wanted to support .
obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
and that made me think that , if we can get 70 percent in afghanistan , then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere .
we have to go for a global truce .
and on the 21st of september this year , we 're going to launch that campaign at the o2 arena to go for that process , to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities .
by working together , we can create peace one day .
thanks a lot . ( applause )
you can see , actually that 's a fluoroscopy .
companies did n't feel it was their responsibility .
now , getting there is not easy .
for example , we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods .
you can end up saving money , and lives , and oil , all at the same time .
or wait to capture the second half of it .
and it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking .
i wanted to test this idea .
so we knew that we had some really solid science here .
we 'll license others to do that .
areca palm is a plant which removes co2 and converts it into oxygen .
because it 's not , the barbaria we have today , it 's perhaps not the barbaria we think .
but from aristotle , let 's move onto a more concrete example of complex systems .
these are scottish terriers .
the pinwheel is an emergent property of the interactions between puppies whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk and therefore to push in a random direction .
so it 's all about finding the simple rules from which complexity emerges .
bechstein 's bats are a common species of european bats .
there is one dominant pair , and many subordinates , some acting as sentinels , some acting as babysitters , some teaching pups , and so on .
what i did n't know , in fact , was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow for this change at the edge of the group to happen and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it .
they simply move together .
i would like to conclude on what this means for the whole species .
( applause ) dania gerhardt : thank you very much , nicolas , for this great start . little bit nervous ?
nicolas perony : i 'm okay , thanks .
so that 's it .
wk : this is my home . this is where i live .
ca : what , to power — for lighting and stuff ?
( applause ) ca : so you copied — you exactly copied the design in the book .
ca : so this one would have to be bigger ?
wk : yeah .
wk : yeah .
ca : and as you think of your life going forward , you 're 19 now , do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy ?
here 's felix , i think . he 's our alpha male ; he 's a kind of big guy .
so see what your intuition is here .
biohackers work alone .
and as he did , he told me how he had come to the city from his village .
there were broken shacks all around .
so when we said goodbye that night , i realized he had also shown me the secret point of travel , which is to take a plunge , to go inwardly as well as outwardly to places you would never go otherwise , to venture into uncertainty , ambiguity , even fear .
and it 's then , when you 're lost or uneasy or carried out of yourself , that you find out who you are .
but when a mathematician tells me that minus three times minus three makes nine , that 's a kind of logic that almost feels like trust .
it 's also the things i do n't know that have often brought me closer to everybody around me .
but the illusion of knowledge can be more dangerous than ignorance .
suddenly , we 're back in that trishaw again and we 're bumping off the broad , well-lit streets ; and we 're reminded , really , of the first law of travel and , therefore , of life : you 're only as strong as your readiness to surrender .
i mean , think about wall street .
but that does n't matter , because this is moving forward .
so we have a choice .
so now put yourself in a city center .
alice bows-larkin : yeah , it 's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees .
i did n't care for it ; it was too painful .
grave 9 , though , matched the family of sergio saul linares .
all put in that grave .
you do n't have to ask permission , as you do in a property-based system .
now , do n't , please , misunderstand me .
youtube , they 're putting this thing on youtube .
throughout the history of computers we 've been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild .
how can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
he can make it out of sheer nothingness , creation ex nihilo .
so what 's a resident to do to fit in ?
what i learned from north idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around .
the reality is that many white americans are affable and kind .
by 2042 , white people will no longer be the american majority .
as a photographer for national geographic , i 've portrayed it for many .
but five years ago , i went on a personal journey .
but there were also revelations .
stromatolites are the heroes in my story .
water froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the earth .
it arises around cracks in the earth .
circuit boards of the future .
and others fly today like echoes of the past .
in birds , life gained new mobility .
water lilies were among the first .
kiwis are , and so are these hawks trapped near antarctica .
extinction can come slowly , but sometimes it arrives fast .
walruses adapted with layers of fat . sea lions got sleek .
and where it does n't , as in greenland in winter , mars is still not very far .
but that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again .
this earth is alive , and it 's made its own membrane .
chris anderson : perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country .
no one . ok , that 's good actually .
there 's another tool that can do that , and we all have it , and that tool is the brain .
`` they use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise would n't have been able to understand at that depth , but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back together again and make a show like `` '' house of cards , '' '' that was nowhere in the data . ''
but that does not change the basic setup .
well , if people see the world in such a way that life sucks , then their behavior will follow automatically from that .
the story that i like to end with is this . it comes out of a place called the gallup organization .
i did not want to recap the crash with abed .
`` it 's just like this one , completely worthless , in which it allegedly worked by `` '' electrostatic magnetic ion attraction , '' '' which translates to `` '' pseudoscientific baloney '' '' — would be the nice word — in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good , but it does absolutely nothing . ''
in this case , at trespass points , allowing people to go through because your little tracker device said they were okay , actually cost lives .
we believe all sorts of things .
and that 's called superstition , and that , i 'm afraid , we will always have with us .
`` i call this process `` '' patternicity '' '' — that is , the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise . ''
when we do this process , we make two types of errors .
so for example , what do you see here ?
or is it more like a frog ?
for example , what do you see here ?
yes , of course , it 's a cow .
here is what you show subjects .
so what we 're trying to do is bore into the brain to see where all this happens .
an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine .
that is , you decrease the amount of dopamine , and their tendency to see patterns like that decreases .
dopamine , i think , changes our signal-to-noise ratio .
again , i 'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here , causing you conflicting pattern detections .
i 'm actually not even sure if this is — this might be photoshopped .
but anyway , the point is still made .
now which one of these looks odd to you ?
so you recognize obama immediately .
this is an idea that we got from a fellow tedster here , dan dennett , who talked about taking the intentional stance .
i think it 's the basis of animism and polytheism and monotheism .
because , let 's face it , some patterns are real .
because it worked .
our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these .
because we can imagine , in essence , continuing on .
we know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe , you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences , near-death experiences , which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there .
you can use — which i did , went out and did — michael persinger 's god helmet , that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves .
would you have any problem kissing our models to test it ?
woman : you would n't ? ( girl : no . ) woman : you 'd think that was fine .
pucker up big and lean in just a little bit , okay ?
i 'm here to spread the word about the magnificence of spiders and how much we can learn from them .
this is a rugged and barren landscape , yet there are quite a few spiders here .
spiders are not just everywhere , but they 're extremely diverse .
to put that number into perspective , here 's a graph comparing the 40,000 species of spiders to the 400 species of primates .
and this is what we see .
you can think of these short motifs that repeat over and over again as words , and these words occur in sentences .
now , it 's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body .
this makes testing spider silk really , really easy to do in the laboratory , because we 're actually , you know , testing it in air that 's exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins .
here are stress-strain curves generated by tensile testing five fibers made by the same spider .
so if the web was made entirely out of dragline silk , an insect is very likely to just bounce right off . but by having really , really stretchy capture spiral silk , the web is actually able to absorb the impact of that intercepted prey .
in fact , the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region , a non orb-web-weaving spider .
scytodes does n't use a web at all to catch prey . instead , scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it , and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect .
think of hunting with silly string .
spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti-ballistic capabilities .
silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today .
already , some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow .
caffeine , for example , works much better with extroverts than it does introverts .
and so , if you would like me to — yes , you would ?
and michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt .
but are there some distinctively elizabethan features of your behavior , or georgian of yours , that make us understand you better than just a bunch of traits ?
so what is it that makes us different ?
it relates to your kid — you 've been back three times to the hospital , and they still do n't know what 's wrong .
or it could be your mom .
and while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it , all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online .
it 's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video with content pulled live directly from the web .
so this is the timeline , and if you 've ever edited video , you 're familiar with this , but instead of clips in the timeline , what you 're looking at is web events pulled into the video .
popcorn immediately goes out onto the web , talks to google , grabs the map , and puts it in the display .
and it 's exactly the same for the people who watch your production .
but this is great fun for children .
and something very , very nice happens .
the company was brilliant .
the founder of the idea is jim march .
our heroes are people who have done exploration : madame curie , picasso , neil armstrong , sir edmund hillary , etc .
it 's about making good products faster and cheaper .
but if we only exploit , it 's very risky in the long term .
as we grow older , we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on .
and this is , of course , a big worry to ceos .
`` or , `` '' how can i make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis ? '' '' so , doing one well is difficult . ''
doing both well as the same time is art — pushing both exploration and exploitation .
so one thing we 've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time , in parallel .
we see this in the public sector as well .
we really do n't give them the chance .
the first lesson is : get ahead of the crisis .
move ahead , take a 10-year perspective on the same company — suddenly , innovation and ability to renew account for 70 percent .
in my case , yes .
let 's start with a story about this culture that lived in micronesia in the early 1900s , called the yap .
so the yap just keep track of who owns part of what stone .
there 's a story about these sailors that were transporting a stone across the ocean when they ran into some trouble and the stone actually fell in .
in 1932 , the bank of france asked the united states to convert their holdings from dollars into gold .
and everyone agreed that france owned the gold .
there 's not even anything physical , like a stone or a coin .
and a lot of times , they do n't .
money only moves at the speed of banks .
we 're about to enter a new phase of money .
in a programmable world , we remove humans and institutions from the loop .
cryptocurrencies are based on a special field of mathematics called cryptography .
anyone can become a bitcoin miner .
it 's the idea of permission-less innovation .
so what kind of world does programmable money create ?
we 're not at this world yet , but it 's coming .
but it also greatly increased productivity .
hi , kids .
( laughter ) i 'm 71 .
people , of course , places , and the boundless energy of my youth , and i 'm beginning to lose independence , and that scares me .
by the way , the dalai lama is someone who has aged beautifully , but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate ?
and it 's good to start early .
she wears red patent shoes , and her mantra is that one scarf is nice but two is better .
she has been a widow for nine years , but she 's not looking for another mate .
but how wrong it is .
his employees are inspired by the effort .
so here i was , the founding principal of a middle school that was a district public school , and i only had 45 kids to start .
thirty percent of them had special needs .
or to have a young woman say to me that she had a lifelong goal of working in a fast-food restaurant .
vidal embodies the story of so many of our underprivileged children who are struggling to survive , which is why we must make education a priority .
and they are our responsibility .
right now .
and that to me is sad .
chris emdin : so i can i get an amen ? audience : amen .
they watch the way that the rappers move and talk with their hands .
thank you .
imagine if i did that to you , came two inches from your face .
autism creates itself .
that 's a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
for me , the best way to be inspired to try
the eminent scientists of the global footprint network , for example , calculate that we need about 1.5 earths to sustain this economy .
in financial terms , this would be like always spending 50 percent more than you earn , going further into debt every year .
but of course , you ca n't borrow natural resources , so we 're burning through our capital , or stealing from the future .
we need it to develop technology .
it 's like the earth does n't care what we need .
it certainly is .
and that 's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for .
when does this breakdown begin ?
i want to talk to you about fear .
but when we think about the kind of possibilities i paint , we should feel a bit of fear .
you ca n't see the danger at your door .
that 's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on , because if we wait until the crisis takes hold , we may panic and hide .
yes , things will get ugly , and it will happen soon — certainly in our lifetime — but we are more than capable of getting through everything that 's coming .
after the bombing of pearl harbor , it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry , and from there to rationing of food and energy .
think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done .
we are smart , in fact , we really are quite amazing , but we do love a good crisis .
and the good news , this one 's a monster .
we can be more , we can be much more .
we 've built a powerful foundation of science , knowledge and technology — more than enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent , meaningful and satisfying lives .
you lose the institutional imperative .
and this is only mapping 10 percent of a mammalian neocortex .
wish us luck .
well , i have to tell you , from the bottom of our hearts , thank you so very , very much .
my family , my kids had all grown up .
`` i do n't feel this is my mission in life . '' '' and he said , `` '' you know , oh by the way , mom , i have to leave early from vacation because my inter-city league team that i play for made the playoffs , and i have to get back to boston because i ca n't let my team down . ''
we walked into the neurologist 's office , sat down , four doctors walk in , and the head neurologist sits down .
i avoided every science class i ever could .
it just does n't seem like there 's a whole lot of collaboration going on here .
we were supposed to have therapies overseas , and the rug was pulled out from under us .
two and a half years ago , pete was hitting home runs at baseball fields .
( laughter ) and those videos , the popular ones .
paul bissonnette 's glacier video , incredible .
`` because this misunderstood and underfunded `` '' rare '' '' disease , they just sat and watched people saying it over and over : `` '' als , als . '' '' it was unbelievable . ''
okay , so the als association , they think by year end , it 'll be 160 million dollars .
it 's coming out starting in two months .
bill gates .
now on to the treatment and cure .
because he wants them to see what the reality of this is , and how he 's never , ever going to give up .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
the game is rigged .
there used to be a time in american history when voting was fun , when it was much more than just a grim duty to show up at the polls .
in akron , it means political plays being performed in the bed of a flatbed truck that moves from neighborhood to neighborhood .
the wall of shame is something .
i have passion in my heart .
it 's about feeling and belief , and it is n't just our organization 's work .
but when politics is about us and our neighbors and other people in our community coming together to create experiences of collective voice and imagination , then we begin to remember that this stuff matters .
both of them bring the imagination to life in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end are imagined , and can be reimagined .
not voting is voting , for everything that you may detest and oppose .
in the 2014 midterm elections , turnout was 36 percent , which was a 70-year low .
i invite you to imagine 100 percent .
peter gabriel : so torture is not something that always happens on other soil .
my grandmother left school when she was 12 .
so look at this little picture .
we have to have a look at this ourselves .
but it 's not my question .
so let 's make a change .
and i want to ask you : do you believe that ?
they bury their dead . they educate the next of kin .
it 's called the blockchain . blockchain .
and overall , they do a pretty good job .
what if there were a native medium for value ?
so for the first time now in human history , people everywhere can trust each other and transact peer to peer .
these miners do a lot of work .
rube goldberg machine .
this is a very powerful idea , that peers can come together and create and share wealth .
she lives in toronto , and every month she goes to the western union office with some cash to send her remittances to her mom in manila .
and data is really a new asset class , maybe bigger than previous asset classes , like land under the agrarian economy , or an industrial plant , or even money .
you know , if you were a songwriter , 25 years ago , you wrote a hit song , it got a million singles , you could get royalties of around 45,000 dollars .
you want to listen to the song ?
this was vodka and solution , gin and solution .
but before i proceed , i should set you the context .
education is completely free .
today , our culture is flourishing .
he was all of 51 years at that time .
that is more co2 than what the entire city of new york generates in one year .
this time , we were heard .
over the next few years , our small economy wo n't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment .
this is why his majesty the king started bhutan for life .
so multiparty , single closing : an idea we borrowed from wall street .
but we are not here to tell stories , are we ?
after all , there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face .
do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them . i know they could .
why have n't we fixed this ?
and you know something about a lousy school ?
you know why ? because they did n't care .
it was about bankers . they created something that worked for them .
maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work .
and if you come up with a plan to change things , people consider you radical .
i said one day , well , look , if the science says — this is science , not me — that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime — you see where they are in june and say , okay , they 're there .
so this is not something that is ordained from the education gods .
because our business has refused to use science .
my wife , yvonne , and i , we have four kids , three grown ones and a 15-year-old .
but we know this is critical .
we know it 's important for kids .
`` people used to say when they 'd come fund us , `` geoff , why do you provide these health services ? '' ''
`` i 'd say , `` '' well , you know a child who has cavities is not going to , uh , be able to study as well . '' '' and i had to because i had to raise the money . ''
i mean , you 're educators . you work , you say , you think you 've got it , great , no ? and you find out they did n't get it .
i need that data in september .
and you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids were on grade level .
so we 're spending all of this money , but we 're getting what ?
let 's try something different . and here 's the rub .
some of it 's not going to work .
`` you know , people tell me , `` '' yeah , those charter schools , a lot of them do n't work . '' '' a lot of them do n't . they should be closed . ''
i was so disgusted i spent my money on this thing .
our job as educators , there 's some stuff we know that we can do .
how many trillions ? ( applause ) when the country cares about something , we 'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye .
`` and you 're not coming back here . '' '' so a bunch of my kids know you ca n't come back to harlem because geoff is looking for you . ''
but i 'm not kidding about some of this , and it gets a little bit to the grit issue .
`` we try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support , but also a set of encouragements that say to them , `` '' you can do it . it is going to be hard , but we refuse to let you fail . '' '' jl : well , thank you dr . canada . ''
( applause )
we get ever more vulnerable .
probably , like , none .
everybody can see the data .
it 's not about the robots .
that 's quite a lot .
and here you see just a selection .
insects are not only there in nature , but they also are involved in our economy , usually without us knowing .
and not only in the states , but in any country , in any economy .
they 're at the start of food chains .
and here you see me in a small , provincial town in china , lijiang — about two million inhabitants .
and here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars , locusts , bee pupae — delicacies .
well we 've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally , but i can tell you that every one of you is eating insects , without any exception .
what are you eating ?
some fruits get some insect damage .
those are the fruits , if they 're tomato , that go to the tomato soup .
cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti .
so it 's a very precious thing that we 're using to dye our foods .
in the developing world it 's much lower .
now to start with , i should say that we are eating way too much meat in the western world .
that means that pigs also share diseases with us .
one kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs , or six big macs .
it 's just very good food .
there are a few people who do n't like shrimp , but shrimp , or crabs , or crayfish , are very closely related .
we 're not used to it , and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us .
( laughter ) well in the netherlands , we have an innovative minister of agriculture , and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .
and when she got all the ministers of agriculture of the e.u .
it 's not something that is a hobby of mine .
( applause )
when the havasupai found out , they sued successfully for $ 700,000 , and they banned asu from conducting research on their reservation .
my vision is to make genetic research more native , to indigenize genome sequencing technology .
traditionally , genomes are sequenced in laboratories .
what if you could fit a genome sequencer in your pocket ?
it does n't have the same physical limitations , in that it 's not tethered to a lab bench with extraneous cords , large vats of chemicals or computer monitors .
and in my little corner of the world , these two things are actually related , and i want to tell you how tonight .
in particular , nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain , that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school , that leave a big scar .
this is the real thing . there 's no blood .
and eventually , if you 're lucky , you achieve mastery .
so we have a problem , and one of the problems is distance .
i work at the cambridge hospital .
they have to be able to teach us something as well .
and in that i need a surgery lexicon .
that 's a tall order . we have to work at it .
we get the words up in a window and then apply the magic .
if you remember what i told you about fls at the beginning , it 's knowledge and skills .
so we 're going to take it one step further ; we 've brought my friend allan back .
very good oscar . i 'll see you next week .
we want it to be bi-directional .
i can think of a million uses for a tool like this .
there is something different ; you can click on it , and if you click on it , you can zoom in on almost any place on the earth .
is that possible ?
and horizontally , the amount of digital information available .
i can extrapolate .
at the archivio di stato , you have 80 kilometers of archives documenting every aspect of the life of venice over more than 1,000 years .
you have every change that was made in the city .
of course , when you digitize , that 's not enough , because these documents , most of them are in latin , in tuscan , in venetian dialect , so you need to transcribe them , to translate them in some cases , to index them , and this is obviously not easy .
this is a domain of something that seems impossible , which can actually be done , simply by putting additional constraints .
`` you can ask questions like , `` who lived in this palazzo in 1323 ? '' ''
so the idea is also to document all the things that worked at the european level .
we can reconstruct also the journey of the venetian maritime empire , how it progressively controlled the adriatic sea , how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time , controlling most of the sea routes from the east to the south .
so how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies ?
maybe there 's not a single map .
imagine , horizontally you see the reconstructed map of a given year , and vertically , you see the document that served the reconstruction , paintings , for instance .
on the contrary , imagine actually that you start from a document , a venetian manuscript , and you show , actually , what you can construct out of it , how it is decoded , how the context of that document can be recreated .
i do n't understand why i felt so great doing it .
i felt great .
i mean , it should have been so blatantly obvious .
it 's so mysterious , and it 's so pervasive .
`` this year is the centennial of his masterpiece , `` '' in search of lost time , '' '' and it 's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness , my brand , that we can hope to have . ( laughter ) and we think about proust , we think about the sentimental bits , right ? ''
we forget how harsh his vision was .
we tell ourselves a story about other people 's lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they 're designed to make us feel terrible .
jealousy makes us all amateur novelists , and this is something proust understood .
it 's a hungry emotion . it must be fed .
jealousy likes details .
does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ?
for a year . a year .
so lestrade needs his help , resents him , and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries .
you know , one minute holmes is on the other side from lestrade .
now , i want to tell you a story about that .
kepler 's main scientific objective was to find planets outside of our solar system .
it was looking for what astronomers call a transit .
this is when the planet 's orbit is aligned in our line of sight , just so that the planet crosses in front of a star .
at the same time of the first data release , astronomers at yale were wondering an interesting thing : what if computers missed something ?
jupiter will make a one percent drop in a star 's brightness .
and so at this point , we set out to learn everything we could about the star to see if we could find any clues to what was going on .
scientists are meant to publish results , and this situation was far from that .
`` now i have to rewrite my paper . '' '' so yes , the natural explanations were weak , and we were curious now . ''
we wrote a proposal to observe the star with the world 's largest radio telescope at the green bank observatory .
and if you search google images , this is what you 'll find .
but if we 're already invoking aliens in this explanation , then who is to say they did n't efficiently clean up all this mess for recycling purposes ?
we 're in a situation that could unfold to be a natural phenomenon we do n't understand or an alien technology we do n't understand .
and what will it mean if we do n't find another star like this ?
so what i want to do is talk a little bit about a couple of strategies here , and these will be really important because you are now in an information target-rich environment for the next several days .
we also want to use imagery . we are built for images .
think about things in images , write things down that way .
we are meaning-making machines . it 's what we do .
but there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease , because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who do n't have diagnostic services , you end up creating a problem of drug resistance .
this was in the 90s during the peak of the hiv epidemic , before there were any arvs in sub-saharan africa .
i was very lucky to come to the us right after high school , and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices .
so this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the third world at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place .
number four : go with the flow .
you 're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place .
`` we listen with the intent to reply . '' '' one more rule , number 10 , and it 's this one : be brief . ''
because they have injected huge productivity improvement .
today in our factories , only 8 percent of the tasks are automated .
it will be 25 percent in 10 years .
these robots are working for us right now .
the new manufacturing revolution makes it possible .
because , when people heard that my son was a victim , i got immediate sympathy .
but when people learned what her son was accused of , she did n't get that sympathy .
and i asked the organization of human rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims .
so the story with zacarias was too much really .
but we were all so nervous .
before we knew each others ' names , or anything , we had embraced and wept .
because our time is up .
they are very happy with their balls-and-sticks models of molecules .
but in everyday life , we can forget about it .
but in the quantum world , this happens all the time .
the box on the left shows the wavelike , spread-out distribution of a quantum entity — a particle , like an electron , which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall .
zoom in a bit more .
now , quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart , and yet somehow remain in contact with each other .
i also think that in the coming decade or so , we 're going to start to see that actually , it pervades life — that life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world .
thank you .
it 's no longer valid or real .
so this whole interaction with self and identity was a very difficult one for me growing up .
but nature had its wicked way , and brown babies were born .
that confirms its existence and its importance .
and it is important .
but my skin color was n't right .
that nagging dread of self-hood did n't exist when i was dancing .
and i was a really good dancer .
on the one hand , result .
but what was credible , what is biological and scientific fact , is that we all stem from africa — in fact , from a woman called mitochondrial eve who lived 160,000 years ago .
and that can happen with awareness — awareness of the reality of oneness and the projection of self-hood .
for a start , we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .
all my senses are alert and alive in much the same way as an infant might feel — that feeling of oneness .
and when i 'm acting a role , i inhabit another self , and i give it life for awhile , because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment .
and i honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure .
i thought i lacked substance , and the fact that i could feel others ' meant that i had nothing of myself to feel .
i 've become very familiar with its dysfunctional behavior .
i was in congo in february , dancing and celebrating with women who 've survived the destruction of their selves in literally unthinkable ways — destroyed because other brutalized , psychopathic selves all over that beautiful land are fueling our selves ' addiction to ipods , pads , and bling , which further disconnect ourselves from ever feeling their pain , their suffering , their death .
and in that disconnected state , yeah , we can build factory farms with no windows , destroy marine life and use rape as a weapon of war .
simple awareness is where it begins .
because the mixing of those two media is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act .
and the idea was to have me record some of my poems and then they would find animators to animate them .
`` one of my students came up after class , an introductory class , and she said , `` '' you know , poetry is harder than writing , '' '' which i found both erroneous and profound . ''
`` ( video ) narration : `` '' some days . '' '' some days i put the people in their places at the table , bend their legs at the knees , if they come with that feature , and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs . ''
`` ( video ) narration : `` '' forgetfulness . '' '' the name of the author is the first to go , followed obediently by the title , the plot , the heartbreaking conclusion , the entire novel , which suddenly becomes one you have never read , never even heard of . ''
( laughter ) and in that way we traded lore with each other .
back in 1995 , we got a new wing next to the museum .
it was made of glass , and this building really helped me to do my job good .
the only thing i had to do was go out , pick them up , and have them stuffed for the collection .
but next to the dead duck is a live duck , and please pay attention .
dan , where are you ? dan ariely ?
please note it 's a museum specimen , but there 's no chance you 'll get the avian flu .
( laughter ) more importantly , people started to send me their observations of remarkable animal behavior , and believe me , if there 's an animal misbehaving on this planet , i know about it . ( laughter )
this is a moose .
barn swallows in hong kong , 2004 .
yet there 's something fascinating happening right now .
and this drive to not only teach but also to entertain resulted in some of the strangest anatomical illustrations .
but if you look closely , you 'll notice that it lacks a brain .
london-based shok-1 paints giant x-rays of pop culture icons .
all of the artists that i showed you here today referenced medical illustrations for their art .
so there seems to be a complete disconnect here .
you see , since the age of about five i 've always asked the question , but why ?
but why do i have to go to school ?
now , at this point you might be imagining one of those lovely tropical island tax havens but here 's the thing , shockingly , my own hometown , london , and indeed the u.k. , is one of the best places in the world to set up an anonymous company .
companies were created to limit financial risk , they were never intended to be used as a moral shield .
and so i come to my wish .
my wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good .
imagine if this data were open and free , accessible across borders for citizens and businesses and law enforcement alike .
there is such an opportunity right now .
this is n't just a dry policy issue .
this is a human issue which affects us all .
now , we can ask , what do we really mean by gratefulness ?
and it 's really given .
it is n't as bad as it might seem .
it may be to stand up for your opinion , to stand up for your conviction .
we rush through life . we do n't stop .
in africa where i was , i did n't have drinkable water .
we want to be the first to do it , for the geeks who appreciate that , we 'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger .
and these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be , and maybe how you can do something about it .
and what 's interesting here is that something else took off along with it : home-theater units .
netflix was right — the netflix model could capitalize on the dvd in a way that the video-rental stores could n't .
and then finally , dvds are approaching free .
as you probably know , gene sequencing — in a large part , because it 's built on computers — is falling in price at a kind of a moore 's law-like level .
now we 've switched to critical mass .
( laughter ) another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars .
at two percent , you start seeing them on the roads everywhere .
it 's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years .
and finally , free . free is really , really interesting .
free is something that comes with digital , because the reproduction costs are essentially free . it comes with ip , because it 's such an efficient protocol . it comes with fiber optics , because there 's so much bandwidth .
you know , there could be a film 's [ unclear ] there , but it 's basically , every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. it takes that entire element , the physical element , of songs off the table .
they 're facing a force that they have n't faced before .
and the consequence of cheap phone calling , free phone calling , to india , is the pissed-off programmer , is the outsourcing .
it 's not that i was fidel castro and i could talk for two hours , or bucky fuller .
and this is really where we were headed .
and then something for me changed pretty profoundly .
nicholas negroponte .
after sleeping in the mud at woodstock , i went off to mit to go to college , where to make money , i worked on the multics project .
multics was a trailblazing interactive time-sharing system .
and i could type some numbers in , and circle it , and press the sum button .
the first thing i thought was the programmer way of doing it .
i did five-year projections . i did all sorts of different scenarios .
and the rest , as they say , is history .
we the children had gathered at a friend 's house .
i wanted to blend in like a chameleon .
and i had become ashamed of the other , the african in me .
i mean , nor had ghana , even though we had been trying very hard .
so here i was , december 7th , 2008 .
and then the cliche came to haunt us .
inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control .
we witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets .
here is another proof that the african is not capable of governing himself .
so it could happen .
we in the west , we preach the values , the golden light of democracy , that we are the shining example of how it 's done .
and yes , we africans can .
while we were living in a community i fondly remember as called ribabad , which means community of the poor , my dad made sure that we also had a house in our rural homeland .
while going to school in karachi and hyderabad , a lot of my cousins and childhood friends were getting married off , some to older men , some in exchange , some even as second wives .
i got to see the beautiful tradition and its magic fade in front of me when i saw that the birth of a girl child was celebrated with sadness , when women were told to have patience as their main virtue .
my oldest brother ali got to be in charge of taking care of the computer , and all of us were given 10 to 15 minutes every day to use it .
as a teenager , i was blaming myself for everything that happened .
the women in the villages had no idea we were fighting for them in the streets .
so then we found out something which was very amazing for us .
it was devastating — like , oh , we ca n't actually do something about this ?
it was a beautiful day .
we soon called this project sughar .
and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
sturgeon may be correct .
`` he said , `` '' it could be a high spade or a low spade . '' '' and my answer was ... ''
hg : indeed ! it was a high spade .
did you feel i influenced you in any decision ?
he took the deck out of the box .
but he left his notebook that was there from the beginning .
sir , i 'm going to ask you , do you have , with you , a united states $ 1 bill ?
go ahead and take some cards and shuffle .
you can shuffle cards in a variety of ways .
`` i said , `` '' can i see some evidence for this ? '' '' so he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots — not very informative . ''
`` i said , `` '' what happens when i grow older and my hair becomes white ? ''
`` where was this guilt trip coming from ? '' '' and he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already , and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing . ''
and i remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
`` who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? '' '' but a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , `` '' what would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ? ''
when i was doing these experiments , in my mind , i was helping science .
we get as lost as mr. domingos .
no ! these are documents written for me , these are the public documents , the public documents i need to understand in my daily life , to govern myself , to live my life .
because if they knew what they were signing , they 'd know that as soon as the interest rate started to rise , the monthly payment would also increase , they would n't be able to pay anymore and they would end up without a house .
let 's , let 's ... of course we will , of course we will educate people .
so , besides increasing literacy [ rate ] , and for now , it 's much more important to reduce the complexity of documents and simplify the language .
it 's communicating in a simple and clear way , enabling our reader to understand it at first glance .
how does that work ? it 's like this : private companies change their language ; communicate in a clearer and simpler way , they make a big fuss about it , consumers love it , the sales rise , it works beautifully .
but it works for the private sector .
it 's not easy , and perhaps it 's even a bit embarrassing , is n't it ?
`` `` '' someone wrote them . '' '' hum ? ''
maybe , among this big group , some persons ...
`` `` '' we ca n't lower the level '' '' ; bla , bla , bla ... ''
and how do you do that ?
what do we do ?
another thing we will do is to grant prizes to the worse and best documents , because , indeed , there are people who are working to communicate in a clearer way , and that have to be rewarded , and there are lazy people that do nothing about it and need to be humiliated .
and write in order to be understood . write to your grandma .
talking about empowerment is odd , because when we talk about empowerment , what affects us most are the stories .
what is it really like to be a young woman in india ?
but yet , it was simple .
and if we did that , then google would back this .
the cities are shown shining bright .
we 've lived in cities for a very long time , but most of us did n't live in cities .
it changes by trial and error .
again , the underlying map is the map of world population , but over it , you 're seeing arrows showing how we spread out of africa with dates showing you where we think we arrived at particular times .
we worry about people .
there are a huge number of good news stories in the world .
you are shown those terrible things on the news every night of the week .
and that is , why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions can display radically different savings behavior ?
my language would force me to tell you whether or not this was an uncle on my mother 's side or my father 's side , whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth , and if this man was my father 's brother , whether he was older than or younger than my father .
all of this information is obligatory . chinese does n't let me ignore it .
and in fact , if i want to speak correctly , chinese forces me to constantly think about it .
`` so for example , if i 'm speaking in english , i have to speak grammatically differently if i 'm talking about past rain , `` '' it rained yesterday , '' '' current rain , `` '' it is raining now , '' '' or future rain , `` '' it will rain tomorrow . '' '' notice that english requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events . ''
`` why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modify what i 'm saying to say , `` '' it will rain , '' '' or `` '' it 's going to rain . '' '' it 's simply not permissible in english to say , `` '' it rain tomorrow . '' '' in contrast to that , that 's almost exactly what you would say in chinese . ''
a chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speaker 's ears .
what you may not have realized is that english is actually an outlier .
`` `` '' excuse me , would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio ? ''
`` how about blowing into this tube so i can measure your lung capacity ? '' '' the survey takes over a day . ''
and what i 'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure , and then i 'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels .
what are the characteristics we can control for ?
now effectively everything i 'm going to tell you from now on is only comparing these basically nearly identical families .
well , think about smoking , for example .
i could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find .
i built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the museum of science and industry in chicago , and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen .
think about which you find easier to use , a physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard like on a phone ?
so here 's an example of what i mean .
so here the left and right channel stay in sync , but if we want to , we can override that by grabbing both of them at the same time .
with this interface , we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and arcade games , where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different styles of play possible .
there 's no technology visible at all .
but when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next ted talk , the objects on the table come alive .
( laughter ) but the reason why is that they 're designed in a very clever way .
and this is a very useful , industrial kind of polymer .
now , our group at mit is trying to take a different point of view from the way neuroscience has been done over the last hundred years .
they 're connected by little junctions called synapses that exchange chemicals and allow the neurons to talk to each other .
the density of the brain is incredible .
so , if you could zoom in to a neuron , and , of course , this is just our artist 's rendition of it .
this could potentially be quite dramatic .
it 's much easier just to buy it off the internet than to extract the few grains that actually occur in these diapers .
and much like drawing a picture on a balloon , and then you blow up the balloon , the image is the same , but the ink particles have moved away from each other .
we have to bring in little tags , with glowing dyes that will distinguish them .
we 're not losing the configuration of the information .
we can start to actually look at how circuits are configured .
what if we could actually look into cells in the brain and figure out , wow , here are the 17 molecules that have altered in this brain tissue that has been undergoing epilepsy or changing in parkinson 's disease or otherwise being altered ?
this is an actual biopsy from a human breast cancer patient .
my hope is we can actually turn what might be a high-risk moon shot into something that 's more reliable .
we understood gravity ; we understood aerodynamics .
a mobile phone can change your life , and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom .
that 's a lot . almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
but today i will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
they said , we do n't want this data retention .
and some even said , this would be stasi 2.0 .
because you can see where i am , where i sleep at night , what i am doing .
and you can even see how i go from frankfurt by train to cologne , and how often i call in between .
you can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
and in the aftermath , also not the fall of the iron curtain .
when you go home , tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they do n't have to do it .
and if you do n't believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
so i could have anything i wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com .
maybe i should register a few extras just in case .
so the fact is that there 's a lot of bad guys on the internet these days , and so we dealt with that by making walled communities , secure subnetworks , vpns , little things that are n't really the internet but are made out of the same building blocks , but we 're still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust .
another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is , you may remember a couple of years ago , all the planes west of the mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in salt lake city had a bug in it .
i 'll come back to that later .
now , china telecom says it was just an honest mistake , and it is actually possible that it was , the way things work , but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to , and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes .
now , of course you could n't do that today .
so all of our systems , more and more , are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology .
there is no plan b right now .
but people wo n't decide to do it until they recognize the need for it , and that 's the problem that we have right now .
`` so i think that , if people understand how much we 're starting to depend on the internet , and how vulnerable it is , we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist , and i think if enough people say , `` '' yeah , i would like to use it , i 'd like to have such a system , '' '' then it will get built . ''
america 's public energy conversation boils down to this question : would you rather die of a ) oil wars , or b ) climate change , or c ) nuclear holocaust , or d ) all of the above ?
four-fifths of the world 's energy still comes from burning each year four cubic miles of the rotted remains of primeval swamp goo .
so it needs refurbishment .
this could cost , by 2050 , five trillion dollars less in net present value , that is expressed as a lump sum today , than business as usual — assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero — a conservatively low estimate .
in other words , we 're going to use our most effective institutions — private enterprise co-evolving with civil society and sped by military innovation to go around our least effective institutions .
so let 's start by making autos oil free .
unfortunately , over the past quarter century , epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars gain weight twice as fast as we have .
indeed , that sort of vehicle fitness then makes electric propulsion affordable because the batteries or fuel cells also get smaller and lighter and cheaper .
and we can use smart it to make traffic free-flowing .
so to get mobility without oil , to phase out the oil , we can get efficient and then switch fuels .
the trucks and planes can realistically use hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
and industry can accelerate too , doubling its energy productivity with a 21 percent internal rate of return .
but industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars of energy still to save .
this is not about new technology , it 's just rearranging our metal furniture .
china leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost .
we 're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on , because they 're 24/7 , whereas wind and solar power are variable , and hence supposedly unreliable .
actually no generator is 24/7 . they all break .
hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they 're forecasted , integrated and diversified by both type and location .
portugal was 45 percent renewable powered , denmark 36 .
in 1976 , for example , government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of gdp could never go down .
well that 's what 's actually happened so far .
but with today 's much better technologies , more mature delivery channels and integrative design , we can do far more and even cheaper .
so focusing on outcomes , not motives , can turn gridlock and conflict into a unifying solution to america 's energy challenge .
he dreamt of acquiring land , riches and power through military conquest .
and the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their spoils , they needed to attack their enemies so brutally that they would surrender on sight .
he grew the bushy black beard that obscured his face .
he slung braces of pistols on either shoulder .
he posted the idea on facebook , where a cameroonian government official saw it and managed to secure a government grant for him .
and i 've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long .
those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals .
an organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years .
and here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system , and we put it into a sampling container .
some of these organisms live even longer .
it 's just one year of data , but you can see how dynamic the southern ocean is .
it 's just a beautiful place .
there are fossils in amongst , and now i 've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals that are down there .
we were wrong then , and we are wrong again .
we have never understood it .
it 's a noisy material , and if we produce roads like in the netherlands , very close to cities , then we would like a silent road .
porous asphalt , a material that we use now in most of the highways in the netherlands , it has pores and water can just rain through it , so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides , and you have a road that 's easy to drive on , so no splash water anymore .
induction can heat , especially steel ; it 's very good at that .
so that 's what we did here . you see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . that 's what we know from practice .
several times we can repeat that .
public space . this is a good public space .
more than 14,000 people died in an instant .
and so i wonder if we should just take a leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things .
it 's a universe based on causality .
double click on an icon , that 's a cause .
open an application , that 's an effect .
you can see how these two worlds collide .
what if we could have these same digital powers in our world ?
and i can think of three ways .
thank you .
but then this changed suddenly .
and i started playing with it more like a puzzle .
the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground .
that is another 25 million barrels a day .
that 's an enormous amount of cars .
all this stuff that happens around .
in denmark , we will drive all the cars in denmark from windmills , not from oil .
in israel , we 've asked to put a solar farm in the south of israel .
and how fast do you think we are moving ?
a simple wooden notice board .
what i 'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater .
you learn that the balloons are possible because there 's some material that will work for them .
i think of somebody you knew and read about , tesla .
how does this work ? well , two ways .
first of all , ambience . i have a whole tedtalk about this .
there 's a second way though , as well .
spaces tend to include noise and acoustics .
hospital sound is getting worse all the time .
( inaudible echoing voice ) not so good , is it ?
in the u.k. , that 's more than 10 percent of the school population .
two and a half thousand pounds .
out of that conference , incidentally , also came a free app which is designed to help children study if they 're having to work at home , for example , in a noisy kitchen .
so we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store .
`` they start with the phrase , `` a friend told me , '' and then they end with the phrase , `` is this true ? '' ''
`` and most of the time i 'm glad to say that i can answer them , but sometimes i have to say , `` '' i 'm really sorry , but i do n't know because i 'm not that kind of a doctor . '' '' that is , i 'm not a clinician , i 'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy . ''
but then one day i started thinking about the mammalian penis .
when you look at a penis in cross section , it has a lot of the hallmarks of a hydrostatic skeleton .
but at the time when i started this project , the best explanation i could find for penal erection was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues , and the spongy tissues filled with blood and pressure rose and voila ! it became erect .
so i thought , wall tissue 's important in skeletons .
and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements .
so the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross helical skeletons cut so that you 're looking at the surface of the wall .
that 's because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton , and that was with fibers at zero degrees and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure .
so it 'll be made of the same cotton cloth , same balloon , same internal pressure .
i really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies .
so i 'll be sharing some of these noes with you .
one month after mubarak stepped down , this was his reward .
no to burning books . the institute of egypt was burned on december 17th , a huge cultural loss .
now , an economy is only as healthy as the entities that make it up .
we had our work cut out for us .
so we met with hundreds of individuals who worked at government agencies , from the tax agency , the lands office , utilities company , the agency that 's responsible for registering companies , and with each of them , we observed them as they served customers , we documented their processes — most of them were manual .
what did we find ?
well , in kenya it was taking 72 days for a business owner to register their property , compared to just one day in new zealand , which was ranked second on the world bank list .
in korea it took 18 days .
god forbid you had to go to court to get help in being able to settle a dispute to enforce a contract , because that process alone would take you 465 days .
now imagine with me , if you had a process you had to go through — had no other alternative — and this process was inefficient , complex and very , very slow .
not out of malice or greed , just trying to make sure that you get something to work for you so you can move on .
thank you .
it is really something .
here 's one .
we 're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect — one cause , one effect .
it 's an enormous burden .
subprime carbon .
the projections for the future are even more dramatic , even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate 40 times larger than renewables .
first , the cost came down much faster than anybody expected , even as the quality went up .
they will likely link up with the european union .
as i said before , we are going to win this .
we now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced .
thank you very much .
but one of the things i 've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent , or cheaper than .
( laughter ) and so she went and formed an alliance with the sierra club and they formed a new organization called the green tea party . ( laughter )
`` i 've got no plans . '' '' it was an exercise in democratic schooling , and i am all for democratic schooling , but we were only seven . ''
we knew it was like six , but we did n't know what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together to give us that massive number .
and at a gathering of prestigious american mathematicians , he walked to the board , took up a piece of chalk , and started writing out the powers of two : two , four , eight , 16 — come on , join in with me , you know how it goes — 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , 512 , 1,024 , 2,048 .
the room went berserk — ( laughter ) — as frank nelson cole sat down , having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics with no words .
it took focus . it took dedication .
it was the year i left university .
in a roomful of maths ph.ds , i 'm as dumb as a box of hammers .
it is in telling the story of the mathematics .
we 're not talking sport today .
it 's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer , and just requires phenomenal grunt .
my laptop at home was looking through four potential candidate primes myself as part of a networked computer hunt around the world for these large numbers .
we 've heard a lot about robots in this ted .
how lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together ?
then they often hear that they 'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test .
but would n't it be great if every once in a while we did mathematics simply because it was fun or beautiful or because it excited the mind ?
from the standpoint of calculation , they 're as easy to understand as one plus one , which is two .
but check this out .
well , on the one hand , it 's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it , right ?
that 's the area .
so the area is also eight times 13 .
now , if we continue this process , we 'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21 , 21 by 34 , and so on .
now , i show all this to you because , like so much of mathematics , there 's a beautiful side to it that i fear does not get enough attention in our schools .
( applause )
two years ago , i have to say there was no problem .
he shows us , i think , the human soul .
to see a vision of the universe that 's more perfect than our own .
and then it was made worse — there were two of them .
leonardo himself had preached against the use of gold , so it was absolutely anathema at that moment .
i mean , it 's a color that i ca n't think of anything that you actually see in nature , that looks that shade .
the label had told me that these pieces were made by the sèvres manufactory , made of porcelain in the late 1750s , and designed by a designer called jean-claude duplessis , actually somebody of extraordinary distinction as i later learned .
where i could n't stop looking .
so what you would have had were candles on either side .
we 've allowed ourselves to lead our fantasy lives in front of screens .
he 's a staffordshire figure made in the middle of the 19th century .
and before that leonardo , i understood that this object could become part of a journey for me every day , sitting in my office .
we call it charter , on the right .
first , we have the fast rise in uganda and zimbabwe .
southeast asia , and so on .
and that with a little bit of help , the brain is able to help itself .
what do i mean by that ?
why ?
the adult brain has stem cells , but they 're very rare and they 're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain .
and they never die , they 're immortal cells .
they have a very important role during the development stage .
but there is one clear thing — that from these cells , we got our stem cell culture .
and we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion ?
so on the left side , you see the monkey that has spontaneously recovered .
since that time , we 've understood much more about these cells .
and then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial .
to illustrate these mindsets in action , i 'm going to take you back to 19th-century france , where this innocuous-looking piece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals in history .
but dreyfus was the only jewish officer at that rank in the army , and unfortunately at this time , the french army was highly anti-semitic .
and this is ubiquitous .
`` but dreyfus is still guilty . '' '' eventually , picquart managed to get dreyfus exonerated . ''
this mindset is what i 'm personally passionate about .
for example , scouts are curious .
they 're more likely to say they feel pleasure when they learn new information or an itch to solve a puzzle .
( aquatic noises ) so this video was taken at aquarius undersea laboratory four miles off the coast of key largo , about 60 feet below the surface .
so rovs are n't new .
scientists use rovs to explore the oceans .
what we 've built is n't unique .
so i want to give you a quick story of how it got started .
well , we did n't find any gold , but we decided that what we found was much more valuable .
it 's an underwater world we 're all exploring together .
now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society , because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage : in politics and economics , in religion and tradition , in gender and generations .
now while those in power , old and new , continue to cling to business as usual , millions are still pushing back , and pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life .
you know , as for that third red line , that off-limits subject , what do you think it might be ?
audience : sex .
if you do n't tie the knot , you ca n't move out of your parents ' place , and you 're not supposed to be having sex , and you 're definitely not supposed to be having children .
this is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the arab region .
and so when faiza eventually fetched up at a hospital in casablanca , the man who offered to help her , instead tried to rape her .
they are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life , but they ca n't find jobs .
now , it 's not as if it 's all rosy in the marital bed either .
now raise your hand if any of this is sounding familiar to you , from your part of the world .
`` and it might sound that these handy hints come from `` '' the joy of sex '' '' or youporn . ''
but while the west has opened on sex , what we found is that arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction .
but what 's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of control : sex wrapped up in religion .
but history shows us that even as recently as our fathers ' and grandfathers ' day , there have been times of greater pragmatism , and tolerance , and a willingness to consider other interpretations : be it abortion , or masturbation , or even the incendiary topic of homosexuality .
the right to express our ideas freely , to marry whom we choose , to choose our own partners , to be sexually active or not , to decide whether to have children and when , all this without violence or force or discrimination .
now given the turmoil in many countries in the arab region , talking about sex , challenging the taboos , seeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury .
behavioral psychology tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above all else .
experts predict ice-free arctic summers as early as 2020 .
i have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections with an accessible medium , one that moves us in a way that statistics may not .
we rode camels in northern africa and mushed on dog sleds near the north pole .
my mother was originally supposed to lead this trip .
my work spirals from the micro to the macro level , excavating hidden histories .
my story is a little bit about war .
and this is n't just tom friedman , it 's actually provable in case after case after case .
`` this is also how ibm was successful in getting watson to beat the two world champions at `` '' jeopardy , '' '' answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one . ''
so we now know that computers can learn , and computers can learn to do things that we actually sometimes do n't know how to do ourselves , or maybe can do them better than us .
how did they do this ?
deep learning is an algorithm inspired by how the human brain works , and as a result it 's an algorithm which has no theoretical limitations on what it can do .
the more data you give it and the more computation time you give it , the better it gets .
as of 2014 , we 're now down to a six percent error rate in image recognition .
for example , google announced last year that they had mapped every single location in france in two hours , and the way they did it was that they fed street view images into a deep learning algorithm to recognize and read street numbers .
so what does it mean now that computers can see ?
this is very different from actually understanding the images .
it 's seen a man before , it 's seen black before , it 's seen a guitar before , but it has independently generated this novel description of this picture .
i want to give you an example .
so the nice thing is that the human and the computer can now work together .
it 's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects that 's separated out these together .
you can see we now have 62 percent of our 1.5 million images classified correctly .
these are services .
i know that when i often tell people about this situation , people can be quite dismissive .
( applause )
but i went to work at an architecture firm , and eventually talked to my coworkers about it , and they loved the idea .
and as we started talking to more people about it , more people wanted to hear about it .
it was a radical transformation , but it was built by a cultural momentum .
good for us !
now the students and i enjoyed the class , but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern , the teaching technology is n't .
note the textbook , the sage on the stage , and the sleeping guy in the back . ( laughter ) just like today .
we announced the class on july 29th , and within two weeks , 50,000 people had signed up for it .
`` a student said , `` '' this class felt like sitting in a bar with a really smart friend who 's explaining something you have n't grasped , but are about to . '' '' and that 's exactly what we were aiming for . ''
now , from khan academy , we saw that short 10-minute videos worked much better than trying to record an hour-long lecture and put it on the small-format screen .
but if you can do it any time , that means you can do it tomorrow , and if you can do it tomorrow , well , you may not ever get around to it . ( laughter ) so we brought back the innovation of having due dates . ( laughter ) you could watch the videos any time you wanted during the week , but at the end of the week , you had to get the homework done .
from eric mazur , i learned about peer instruction , that peers can be the best teachers , because they 're the ones that remember what it 's like to not understand .
sebastian and i have forgotten some of that .
of course , we could n't have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students , so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums .
they got this statement of accomplishment .
we 're gathering thousands of interactions per student per class , billions of interactions altogether , and now we can start analyzing that , and when we learn from that , do experimentations , that 's when the real revolution will come .
this actually forms a large part of our decision-making process .
well , it sounds like a pretty good idea , but this task , as bruno mentioned , is n't an easy one for two main reasons : first , the detection algorithms .
the majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain , and to increase the area that 's available for mental capacity , the brain surface is highly folded .
now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses .
now this is quite time consuming and is n't the most comfortable process .
so evan , choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind .
so once we accept this , the cube is live .
`` and the great thing about it is that we 've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about `` '' disappear . '' '' as there is a machine learning algorithm in this — ( applause ) thank you . ''
in games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character .
the technology can also be applied to real world applications — in this example , a smart home .
now smile to go straight .
i 'm going to talk about how they 're useful when we reflect , learn , remember and want to improve .
a few years ago , kevin kelly , my partner , and i noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary , familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day .
this tracks your activity and also your sleep .
i just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor .
this is a beautiful , new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data , not just whether you 're asleep or awake , but also your phase of sleep — deep sleep , light sleep , rem sleep .
but we think of these tools as pointing outward , as windows and i 'd just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors .
some people will say it 's for biometric security .
because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium .
here 's what had to happen .
the next thing is , that virus dna made stuff that chopped up the bacteria dna .
here , this cloaked , secret agent virus is slipping his dna into the bacterial cell , but here 's the kicker : it does n't do anything harmful — not at first .
so this stuff is not that hard , right ?
so we have this field of science that 's all about slime , and color changes . check this out .
and then we have , of course , as any good scientist has to have , explosions !
then it would be accurate , but it would be completely impossible to understand .
but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across .
now , finally , i am often so disappointed when people think that i 'm advocating a dumbing down of science .
that 's not true at all .
make me laugh . make me care .
how should you start ?
but about 10 percent of the time , after the patient has recovered from one of those events , pain persists .
imagine i were to stroke your child 's arm with this feather , and their brain [ was ] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch .
the worst part was that she had allodynia , the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch .
the lightest touch of her arm — the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on — caused excruciating , burning pain .
these cells , called glial cells , were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together , like the nerves .
it 's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch , the toilet flushed three doors down , or your dishwasher went on , or your computer monitor turned off .
so , physics and marketing .
`` we 'll start with something very simple — newton 's law : `` the force equals mass times acceleration . '' ''
it explains why hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners , and why companies like unilever and p & g keep brands separate , like ariel and pringles and dove rather than having one giant parent brand .
so next , the scientific method — an axiom of physics , of all science — says you can not prove a hypothesis through observation , you can only disprove it .
the message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed .
( applause )
everything else is mandated .
and we 've got to end up with a smaller government .
and then they 'll be able to see shape .
i 'm driven by pure passion to create photographs that tell stories .
the boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then .
i am a relentless collector of magical moments .
the entire concept came about in 1996 .
i see time as a fabric as well , except i take that fabric and flatten it , compress it into single plane .
former un secretary kofi annan has spoken candidly about his personal failure leading to the rwandan genocide .
our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change .
we do n't have to have all the answers to call for change .
i 'm ellen , and i 'm totally obsessed with food .
i think about eating a lot , and i really love it .
here we have a story .
seven different salts .
right now , talking to you , i 'm not even really a guy .
`` [ `` '' i do n't need 2 write it down . '' '' ] ( applause ) ''
loved to fight , lost his arm in one of these battles .
that 's where the concept of ruling with an iron fist comes from .
so these external prosthetics have now become artificial knees .
you can record , and oh , by the way , they also put a phone into this .
and one of the things that we 've been doing is trying to figure out how to reprogram cells .
and once you can insert an entire human genome into a cell , then you begin to ask the question , would you want to enhance any of that genome ?
the answer lies in part with lord rees , astronomer royal of great britain .
right ?
we do n't know , if you change the gravity substantially , if the same thing will happen to create your body .
you alter your looks , and i 'm told that not all of those alterations take place for medical reasons .
the second experiment , or the other implication of this experiment , is that all of you , all life is based on 20 amino acids .
two possible outcomes to this experiment .
if you can get a mouse that is functional , then you can see , is the new brain a blank slate ?
and boy , does that have implications .
( laughter ) this is taken from six billion miles away , and that 's earth .
today , some 25 , 30 years later , we 're talking about a mortality rate that 's reduced by 85 percent .
today , we 've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality from heart disease — remarkably , 1.1 million deaths averted every year .
these are just remarkable , remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers .
unfortunately , the news is not all good .
what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is .
and maybe at this point , when you know what i do , or maybe what i 've failed to do , you 'll think that i probably ought to be fired , and i could certainly understand that .
it depends , of course , on what scale or what scope you want to think about , but this is an organ of surreal complexity , and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it , whether you 're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections .
it 's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like huntington 's or parkinson 's or alzheimer 's disease where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex .
they 've crossed a brain threshold much earlier , that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 , but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain , not at the level of behavior .
thanks very much .
how about this word ?
you know , we have victorian design with an engine on it . that 's all !
and when you improve searchability , you actually take away the one advantage of print , which is serendipity .
that 's 500,000 more words . so that 's a lot .
we just do n't know enough , and we do n't even know that we 're missing california .
what newspaper was it in ? what book ?
no job felt more perfect for me .
and most of us , when we see someone in uniform going through our neighborhoods feel curiosity , if not concern .
people in my family were experiencing it .
we have come for economic and educational opportunity .
her mother is part italian , part mexican and part german .
immigrants ' votes , voices and vantage points are what we all need to work to include in american democracy .
and i would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point , that the bridge that t. boone pickens talked about will get us to .
so this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that 's going on inside the sun .
i developed a detector that replaces the current detectors that homeland security has .
in 2010 , i had the chance to be considered for promotion from my job as director of policy planning at the u.s. state department .
but i had been commuting for two years between washington and princeton , new jersey , where my husband and my two teenage sons lived , and it was not going well .
i tried on the idea of eking out another two years in washington , or maybe uprooting my sons from their school and my husband from his work and asking them to join me .
but that 's only half of real equality , and i now think we 're never going to get there unless we recognize the other half .
and to get there , we have to change our workplaces , our policies and our culture .
and a 2012 study of employers showed that deep , flexible practices actually lowered operating costs and increased adaptability in a global service economy .
and what criteria should they use to make that decision ?
the governments that get it — no surprises here — the governments that get it , norway , sweden , denmark , the netherlands , provide universal child care , support for caregivers at home , school and early childhood education , protections for pregnant women , and care for the elderly and the disabled .
those societies also show you that breadwinning and caregiving reinforce each other .
when a man , on the other hand , decides to be a caregiver , he puts his manhood on the line .
for a man , that 's a risky proposition .
at least in the united states , lots of men take pride in cooking , and frankly obsess over stoves .
thank you .
not that we could have afforded i drive , but to give me the dream of driving .
and on my seventeenth birthday , i accompanied my little sister in complete innocence , as i always had all my life — my visually impaired sister — to go to see an eye specialist .
but more importantly , let me tell you — i 'm going to come up really close here . do n't freak out , pat .
the really strange part is that , at three and a half , just before i was going to school , my parents made a bizarre , unusual and incredibly brave decision .
and then i went to business school .
and you know , disabled people are hugely educated .
i had built a persona all around what i could and could n't do .
`` i ca n't see , and i need help . '' '' asking for help can be incredibly difficult . ''
god no , it was therapy .
why are you fighting so hard not to be yourself ?
`` and i went home , and , because the pain in my chest ached so much , i thought , `` '' i 'll go out for a run . '' '' really not a very sensible thing to do . ''
and i was floored , and i was broken , and i was angry .
and i sprinted home , and i did n't fall , and i did n't crash .
i had no idea how . i had no idea how you hire an elephant , get an elephant .
i did n't speak hindi . i 'd never been to india . had n't a clue .
when i came home off that elephant , do you know what the most amazing part was ?
i left , and i became a social entrepreneur , and i set up an organization with mark shand called elephant family , which deals with asian elephant conservation .
and you know , the oddest part is , when i was on my way traveling here to ted , i 'll be honest , i was petrified .
being absolutely true to yourself is freedom .
thank you .
( applause )
he actually was the first person to clone a dog , which is a very difficult thing to do , because dog genomes are very plastic .
but if you can clone that horse , you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud .
and that changed my mindset forever .
and they were catching up indeed .
you see this enormous inequity in china , in the midst of fast economic growth .
recently , i showed this to my students , and i just asked them to try and explain why it happened .
and third , through intense reflection , he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure , and then , with a steady hand , he saved my life .
now i absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom , and before i went back into the classroom that fall , i wrote down three rules of my own that i bring to my lesson planning still today .
questions can be windows to great instruction , but not the other way around .
can we be the surgeons of our classrooms ?
so these are my daughters .
on the right we have little emmalou — southern family .
i could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything .
we all were at that age .
thank you very much .
but by 1949 , the soviet union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power , and they began to match what the united states had developed .
`` it 's a very difficult number to deal with , because what we 've done is we 've quote unquote `` '' decommissioned '' '' some of the warheads . ''
we were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym , which is mad .
it was absolutely incredible .
so what we offered ourselves was a collection of things . i 'm just going to go skim through a few things , just to jog your memories .
now , the bomb shelters at that point — let 's say you bought a prefab one — it would be a few hundred dollars , maybe up to 500 , if you got a fancy one .
they would propose — actually there were about six volumes written on this — a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the united states having three to four days warning that the soviets were going to attack us .
it was just completely off the wall .
turns out that they had another idea behind it , even though this was — they were telling the public it was to save us .
the main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality .
they 're acquirable , let me put it that way .
so , what i 'd like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly enriched uranium .
the third element of the nuclear terror threat is that , who would actually do such a thing ?
well , what we 're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized .
`` he wrote many , many times statements to this effect : `` '' we have the right to kill four million americans , two million of whom should be children . '' '' and we do n't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm , for whatever their reasons . ''
you ca n't get an exact number for that kind of probability , but what i 'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening .
`` this is a 10-kiloton bomb , slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima . and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information . i think — `` '' news you could use '' '' kind of concept here . ''
this is the ultimate .
the thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is — first of all , tens of millions of degrees fahrenheit at the core here , where it goes off , and an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat , acute radiation and blast effects .
well , if we 're talking about the old days of an all-out nuclear attack , you , up here , are as dead as the people here . so it was a moot point .
but in 2008 , there is n't one single american city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster .
the key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out , and not going into harm 's way .
you want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud , i said , in just a few minutes .
and jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything , whether it 's war or terrorism , is abolition of nuclear weapons .
now , this is my favorite civil defense slide , and i — ( laughter ) — i do n't want to be indelicate , but this — he 's no longer in office . we do n't really care , ok .
but , as i grew up , i had this sinking realization , that i was n't gon na get to live any more than one life .
there 's a time you had to get your hands dirty .
made it her home .
maybe we are learning the art of embracing .
i have six older brothers and a sister .
rule number one : do n't let your big brother see you do anything stupid .
that was my private world .
by 14 , i knew i really wanted to be an artist .
i made about 200 of these paintings , some of them six to eight feet , like this one .
she had this huge mug she made she loved to drink her coffee out of , and she loved irish soda bread for breakfast .
i 'd blow-dry her hair .
this was the most important thing .
so i packed up my car and i drove back to brooklyn , and painting is what i 've always done , so that 's what i did .
it 's like a release of everything that was unraveling in me .
when the idea hit me of how to do this , i got kind of nauseous and dizzy , which is really just adrenaline , probably , but for me it 's a really good sign .
expansive space instead of the isolated bathtub .
thank you .
sometimes the conversation even bled into real life .
they treated us like family .
and finally ...
this is the core mystical moment of islam , and as such , of course , it defies empirical analysis .
( laughter ) and i plead guilty as charged , because all exploration , physical or intellectual , is inevitably in some sense an act of transgression , of crossing boundaries .
in fact , he was so sure that he could only be majnun , possessed by a jinn , that when he found himself still alive , his first impulse was to finish the job himself , to leap off the highest cliff and escape the terror of what he 'd experienced by putting an end to all experience .
we close the doors and hunker down , convinced that we 're in control , or , at least , hoping for control .
fear was the only sane response , the only human response .
i have faith , for instance , that peace in the middle east is possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence to the contrary .
i can hardly say i believe it .
we insist on faith in the future and in each other .
and he 'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process of making peace .
then i started to panic .
i 've had one of my assistants run the numbers .
also you can cut up carrots , and you can dip them .
i 'm doing time here . this is not my home .
our machines increasingly do our work for us .
there 's a general principle here .
does that mean there 's nothing to worry about ?
norway has invested to build a society with opportunity and economic mobility .
i was born premature by about 10 weeks , which resulted in my blindness , some 64 years ago .
it 's an interaction between volunteers , passionate inventors and technology , and it 's a story that many other blind people could tell .
i do n't know where julian morrow got that from .
i gave them a tape recorder , and they read into it .
but sadly , her health has n't permitted her to come today .
it 's a keynote gold 84k , and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory . ( laughter )
sadly , he died in a light plane crash in 2005 , but his memory lives on in my heart .
he then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier .
it 's called jaws , job access with speech , and it sounds like this .
( jaws speaking ) ron mccallum : is n't that slow ?
can we play that one ?
of course , talking books for the blind predated all this technology .
in no other latin american country are there more than a couple of thousand .
i want to thank her too .
thank you very much .
last i heard , there are two dozen universities in china right now teaching all in english .
the reason i 'm reciting those things to you is because i can tell that we 're getting to the point where a question is going to start being asked , which is : why should we learn foreign languages — other than if english happens to be foreign to one ?
i think there are a lot of reasons , but i first want to address the one that you 're probably most likely to have heard of , because actually it 's more dangerous than you might think .
`` so , `` '' la table , '' '' `` '' la mesa , '' '' you just have to deal with it . ''
it 's hard not to love data like that , and many people will tell you that that means that there 's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages .
what worldview is shaped through the english language that unites them ?
bilingualism is healthy .
imagine being able to do that for years and years at a time .
me either , but if i did , i would get to roll around in my mouth not some baker 's dozen of vowels like english has , but a good 30 different vowels scooching and oozing around in the cambodian mouth like bees in a hive .
we never owned a home , a car , a washing machine , and for most of my childhood , we did n't even have a telephone .
a remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered , which scientists call post traumatic growth .
take this resume .
you know , i 've always wanted one of these .
and advancing retes became cultural emblems .
and third , layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed .
here 's a picture that i took in southern patagonia .
every pebble that you see on the ground there is a piece of dinosaur bone .
this is a femur , a thigh bone , of a giant , plant-eating dinosaur .
so can you imagine a big bull , 65-ton dreadnoughtus in the breeding season , defending a territory ?
sea monsters like the mosasaur were real .
we , on the other hand , do have a choice .
and the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet is both precarious and potentially fleeting .
i also learn early on that costuming can play a key role in this storytelling .
and about 15 minutes in something happens .
thank you .
first , you encrypt the connection between your computer and the email server .
well , it 's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server .
so here we have bob and alice , who want to communicate privately .
number three , a boy .
thank you very much .
of course , they have a carport .
you want to laugh , but you do n't know — you 're that politically corrected , have you noticed ?
`` `` '' que ? '' '' which means `` '' what , '' '' and so much more . ''
cancer is a very clever disease .
and guess what ? our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object .
they look like they 're about to get into a cage match , right ?
angela merkel has — she always does — that look , she always does that .
goods and services and people and capital are moving across borders faster and faster than ever before , but americanization is not .
i 'll go around it .
well , we 're here because the united states , we spent two trillion dollars on wars in iraq and afghanistan that were failed .
look , there are three reasons why the middle east has had stability such as it is . right ?
number two , it was easy to take a lot of cheap money out of the ground because oil was expensive .
those are the three most important economies in asia .
we see that in argentina .
those countries can fall off the map .
so you 're really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the winners and the losers across africa .
those are awesome neighbors .
we can still be that cheerleader on values .
are we prepared to truly lead by example ?
what would we have to do to fix this after november , after the next president comes in ?
i want to talk about sex for money .
i 'm not an academic , a journalist or a politician .
every month my wages would just replenish my overdraft .
i was exhausted and my life was going nowhere .
but it was n't going to happen anytime soon , and my rent needed paying .
the first approach is full criminalization .
imagine knowing if you 're busted carrying condoms , it 'll be used against you .
would you pack condoms to go to work ?
how do you pay that fine without going back to the streets ?
i do n't think this is an accident .
if someone needs to sell sex because they 're poor or because they 're homeless or because they 're undocumented and they ca n't find legal work , taking away that option does n't make them any less poor or house them or change their immigration status .
people have all kinds of complicated feelings when it comes to sex .
we 're supported in our demands by global bodies like unaids , the world health organization and amnesty international .
but we need more allies .
i explained who i was , and i asked if they could tell me why they requested infant retinas in march of 2010 , and i asked if my family could visit their lab .
they said that they had never done this before , and they could n't guarantee a response , but they would n't be an obstacle , and they would deliver it .
two days later , i got a response from dr. arupa ganguly of the university of pennsylvania .
she also explained that thomas had a secret code name .
this shipping label is like an heirloom to us now .
so there are up to a million people there everyday .
maybe you had a direct line .
`` when you hear the word `` '' forger , '' '' you often understand `` '' mercenary . '' '' you understand `` '' forged currency , '' '' `` '' forged pictures . '' '' my father is no such man . ''
for 30 years of his life , he made false papers — never for himself , always for other people , and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed .
i grew up in the paris suburbs and i was the youngest of three children .
i was in high school and got a bad grade , a rare event for me , so i decided to hide it from my parents .
i was born in algeria .
`` there i would hear people say my father was a `` '' moudjahid '' '' and that means `` '' fighter . '' '' later on , in france , i loved eavesdropping on grownups ' conversations , and i would hear all sorts of stories about my father 's previous life , especially that he had `` '' done '' '' world war ii , that he had `` '' done '' '' the algerian war . ''
but knowing my father , and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent , i found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun .
but the document i happened to see that would help us build a case for the authorities was a document from the army that thanked my father for his work on behalf of the secret services .
the whole family came to settle in france in the '30s .
during that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was 15 .
this coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness .
it was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .
of course he knew .
and my father immediately replied that he knew exactly how to bleach it .
if he slept one hour , 30 people would die .
to him , being paid would have meant being a mercenary .
`` then as time passed , at the end of almost two years , they thought , `` well , perhaps our father has died . '' ''
and then my father connected with nelson mandela 's anti-apartheid party .
my father made false papers for the american deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the vietnamese .
his name is adolfo kaminsky and i 'm going to ask him to stand up .
i attended boarding school and college in new england , studied abroad in chile and returned to the bronx to be a middle school teacher .
or , i am exceptional , which means i 've had to leave the people i love behind .
so when we look at why it is that pixar is able to do what it does , we have to ask ourselves , what 's going on here ?
it 's about design thinking where you have that interesting combination of the scientific method and the artistic process .
`` bill said , `` '' i lead a volunteer organization . ''
why do we cheat ?
and why do happy people cheat ?
so this talk is for anyone who has ever loved .
today , monogamy is one person at a time .
so it 's never been easier to cheat , and it 's never been more difficult to keep a secret .
we have a romantic ideal in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs : to be my greatest lover , my best friend , the best parent , my trusted confidant , my emotional companion , my intellectual equal .
strange , she thinks , we just saw each other .
and , partners who were sexually indifferent find themselves suddenly so lustfully voracious , they do n't know where it 's coming from .
something about the fear of loss will rekindle desire , and make way for an entirely new kind of truth .
but affairs are here to stay , and they 're not going away .
sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner .
but he knew about the cheap and simple one .
she hemmed and hawed .
young women have lots of reasons for participating .
who is entitled to enjoy it ?
but absence of pain — that 's a very low bar for your own sexual fulfillment .
she finally decided that she was n't a virgin anymore after she 'd had her first orgasm with a partner .
i want them to be safe from unwanted pregnancy , disease , cruelty , dehumanization , violence .
here 's an example of a cat named gizmo .
we are all different .
we were missing the stories about iraq , the people who live there , and what was happening to them under the weight of the war .
i felt like we could n't let that become another one of the stories we left behind .
our local journalists are our mentors .
the second thing they assume is that i have lots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there .
that way , you save eight minutes every half hour , so in the course of two hours of watching tv , you find 32 minutes to exercise .
and what this shows us is that time is highly elastic .
or maybe you want to run a 5k .
we do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them .
i find a really good time to do this is friday afternoons .
but anyway , just a short list , two to three items in each .
i mean , some people 's lives are just harder than others .
that is a lot of time .
( laughter ) you can guess in which direction , right ?
but small moments can have great power .
but it does n't really tell us who we are .
and i looked at word analysis .
now , there 's a blank , so there 's no bullet .
that 's 17,000 a day , and i have them all .
jf : well , there 's all kinds of friends .
the planet needs women .
we do n't want iran to get the bomb .
stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that did n't like our cheese — sniffed , but did n't want to eat .
the dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it 's trying to infect is actually running on that target .
they knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
they probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
it is generic .
thanks .
so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
there is only one , and that 's the united states — fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
and you know what ?
isabel and i were serious about doing this .
iw : so to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world : go for it !
and i guess what 's interesting is , is that i am now obsessed with the technology of the body .
so we 're experts in physical thinking already .
we only think about them when they go wrong , so , when there 's a broken arm , or when you have a heart attack , then you become really very aware of your bodies .
usually , dance has a stimulus or stimuli , and i thought i 'd take something simple , ted logo , we can all see it , it 's quite easy to work with , and i 'm going to do something very simply , where you take one idea from a body , and it happens to be my body , and translate that into somebody else 's body , so it 's a direct transfer , transformation of energy .
`` so all i 'm doing is exploring this space of `` '' t '' '' and flashing through it with some action . ''
i 'm not remembering what i 'm doing .
i 'm not asking them to copy exactly .
i can watch that and that can tell me something about how it is that they 're moving .
yeah , they 're super quick , right ?
some work very much in specific detail .
i want you to think about them as architectural objects , so what they are , are just pure lines .
so what i 'm thinking about is taking a few physical extensions from the body as i move , and i move them , and i do that by suggesting things to them : if , then ; if , then . okay , so here we go .
whoa , underneath , whoo-um . yeah ? underneath . jump .
underneath . jump . paolo , kick . do n't care where . kick .
whoaa . just after it , maybe . whoaa , whaaay , ooh .
grab her waist , come up back into her first , whoom , spin , turn her , whoo-aa . ( snaps ) great .
and we 're going to build something now , organize it , the phrases . here we go . nice and slow ?
okay , you can open your eyes if you had them closed .
i know , i think we should keep them as a surprise .
ted dance . okay . here it comes . i 'm going to organize it quickly .
breaking celery or frozen lettuce .
( water splashes at lower octave ) and then they removed a lot of the high frequencies .
( water splashes at lower octave ) and then they added a little bit of the splash from the overhead microphone .
reverberation , or reverb , is the persistence of the sound after the original sound has ended .
( glass breaks ) scientists believe that dissonant sounds , for example , brass or wind instruments played very loud , may remind us of animal howls in nature and therefore create a sense of irritation or fear .
also , it can minimize certain visual restrictions that directors have and can show something that was n't there during filming .
so thanks for listening .
we chart it , we 've described it , we 've drawn it , we 've mapped it .
scientists , sort of at the end of the 20th century , learned that they could track blood flow to map non-invasively where activity was going on in the human brain .
on the side here , this is temporal cortex .
they 're probably less cell dense .
and as you can see , they 're very non-uniformly distributed .
and how they 're distributed really contributes to their underlying function .
they 're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement .
and on these chromosomes are roughly 25,000 genes .
and so our project is seeking to look at this readout , understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on .
one side note on the collection of brains : because of the way that we collect , and because we require consent , we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains .
and those are frozen solid , and they 're shipped to seattle .
this is 20 microns thin , so this is about a baby hair 's width .
and remember , it 's frozen .
so again this is what they can see under the microscope .
this is a more detailed map .
now we do this over and over again , this process for any given brain .
so each sample gets us about 50,000 data points with repeat measurements , a thousand samples .
so roughly , we have 50 million data points for a given human brain .
so here 's the modalities that we put together .
you 'll start to recognize these things from what we 've collected before .
and remember that we 've assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome and have all of that data available .
these are two genes that we found as good examples .
we 're certainly going to be looking at more .
i 'm here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psychological trap disguised as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
my dog is a black lab , and i drive a honda odyssey minivan .
he told me two things .
one of the smartest things conor did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that i was the dominant partner in the relationship .
i also did n't know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
and he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he 'd experienced as a young boy .
the first time , i was driving to find a secret beach and i got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver 's side window .
i did n't know he was abusing me .
we tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods .
`` right now , maybe you 're thinking , `` wow , this is fascinating , '' or , `` '' wow , how stupid was she , '' '' but this whole time , i 've actually been talking about you . ''
you have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
we victims need everyone .
it 's about two meters by three , and you are all welcome any time .
so that 's what those great meditators have been doing .
our most recent move is the paris treaty , and the resulting climate agreements that are being ratified by nations around the world .
the second thing you should notice is that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries , from china , from india , from the rest of the world , which includes south africa and indonesia and brazil , as most of these countries move their people into the lower range of lifestyles that we literally take for granted in the developed world .
the oecd europe has a choice .
it urbanized .
in fact , in 2040 , it 's still estimated that 200 million people in china will not have access to clean cooking fuels .
it 's not because they do n't know the alternatives ; it 's because rich countries can do what they choose , poor countries do what they must .
that 's what the eia forecast tells us .
right now , we 're basically waiting for a miracle .
the second thing is the sense of smell .
the date was february 2000 .
and among all this biodiversity that they had never seen before , they found one species that caught their attention very quickly .
first , because 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation , so it 's a big part of the problem .
they are standing dead trees because of the larvae of the beetle .
two ways , two tons .
i 'll tell you .
first , they took me to the offices of farrar , straus and giroux .
next , they took me to the offices of w.w. norton , where i was pretty sure i 'd be escorted from the building just for wearing doc martens .
misfit people — we do n't always know how to hope or say yes or choose the big thing , even when it 's right in front of us .
it 's a shame we carry .
all i had to do was give voice to the story .
you can even lose your marbles .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
science , we generally are told , is a very well-ordered mechanism for understanding the world , for gaining facts , for gaining data , that it 's rule-based , that scientists use this thing called the scientific method and we 've been doing this for 14 generations or so now , and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard , cold facts out of the data .
`` well , the course i was and am teaching is called cellular and molecular neuroscience - i . ( laughs ) it 's 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts , it uses this giant book called `` '' principles of neural science '' '' by three famous neuroscientists . ''
we talk about what still has to get done , what 's so critical to get done in the lab .
`` now i use this word `` '' ignorance , '' '' of course , to be at least in part intentionally provocative , because ignorance has a lot of bad connotations and i clearly do n't mean any of those . ''
so that 's the kind of ignorance that i want to talk about today , but of course the first thing we have to clear up is what are we going to do with all those facts ?
so it is true that science piles up at an alarming rate .
how can you ever know all of this ?
this is really well said , i thought , by george bernard shaw .
what are we using this collection of facts for ?
sometimes we call them bull sessions .
so how do we think about these questions ?
so let 's put a point on the graph . there 's an undergraduate .
does n't know much but they have a lot of interest .
now you look at a master 's student , a little further along in their education , and you see they know a bit more , but it 's been narrowed somewhat .
and finally you get your ph.d. , where it turns out you know a tremendous amount about almost nothing . ( laughter ) what 's really disturbing is the trend line that goes through that because , of course , when it dips below the zero axis , there , it gets into a negative area .
let me give you a quick idea of a couple of these sorts of questions .
a hundred years of robotics , and we ca n't get a robot that can move more than a couple steps one way or the other .
but here 's a diagram of five molecules and sort of a chemical notation .
and secondly , how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom ?
and it 's this abiding by ignorance that i think we have to learn how to do .
i guess it comes down to our education system , so i 'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education , because i think that 's where it really has to play out .
so what do we have to do ? we have to give our students a taste for the boundaries , for what 's outside that circumference , for what 's outside the facts , what 's just beyond the facts .
well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
is this what we want ?
well , first , we need data .
we started our media lab , sounds like a real great story .
this is no hypothetical question .
given that it was such a vast civilization , you might expect to find really powerful rulers , kings , and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings .
in fact , what archeologists have found is none of that .
so that was pretty exciting .
but does this prove that these seals contain dravidian names based on planets and star constellations ?
( applause )
why not have a real robot and real physics ?
three years ago , i was standing about a hundred yards from chernobyl nuclear reactor number four .
i just wanted to get the job done and get out of there fast .
i mean , after all , chernobyl 's soil , water and air , are among the most highly contaminated on earth , and the reactor sits at the the center of a tightly regulated exclusion zone , or dead zone , and it 's a nuclear police state , complete with border guards .
i mean , were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them , or both ?
the thing is , they see their lives and the risks they run decidedly differently .
another village might have six or seven residents .
wild boar , lynx , moose , they 've all returned to the region in force , the very real , very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans .
the dead zone , it turns out , is full of life .
i mean , what about their health ?
thank you .
( applause )
red circle .
josh .
i 'm going to talk about growing older in traditional societies .
at the worst extreme , many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways : by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die , or by abandoning them when the group moves , or by encouraging older people to commit suicide , or by killing older people .
still a third reason is our american cult of youth , which shows up even in our advertisements .
big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives , much better health in our old age , and much better recreational opportunities .
when we want some information , we look it up in a book or we google it instead of finding some old person to ask .
conversely , i at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life .
what can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the u.s. , and to make better use of their value ?
in my remaining four minutes today , i can offer just a few suggestions .
most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things , but millions of older americans do .
older people have that experience .
a challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing .
( applause )
billion-dollar industries thrive because of the fear of it , and those of us who undeniably are it are left to navigate a relentless storm surrounding it .
these judgments are insidious .
so when i was six years old , my sister used to teach ballet to a bunch of little girls in our garage .
i 've spent the last 20 years unpacking and deprogramming these messages , and it 's been quite the roller coaster .
i 've been openly laughed at , abused from passing cars and been told that i 'm delusional .
instead , we value mental health , self-worth and how we feel in our bodies as vital aspects to our overall well-being .
`` this was so true of `` '' aquaporko ! '' '' — ( laughter ) the fat fem synchronized swim team i started with a group of friends in sydney . ''
it actually also does this with incredible prudence , detecting and reacting to every tiny threat , and furthermore , remembering every previous threat , in case they are ever encountered again .
the product is embedded in the larger system of the human body , and it works in complete harmony with that system , to create this unprecedented level of biological protection .
as a lapsed biologist , i decided to immediately call a real biologist , my friend simon levin , professor of biology and mathematics at princeton university .
in fact , we saw these principles not only in biologically enduring systems , we also found them being very characteristic of long-lived social systems , like the roman empire and the catholic church , believe it or not .
because it lacks the resources to shape its environment through brute force .
and essentially these seven manuscripts disappeared for 700 years , and we have a prayer book .
and with just a magnifying glass , he transcribed as much of the text as he could .
but it 's not in an institution , it was bought by a private owner in 1998 .
and they came from all sorts of different backgrounds .
and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with : there was glue on the spine of the book .
now that 's a before and after image , but you do n't read the image on the screen like that .
with this kind of imaging — this kind of infrared , ultraviolet , invisible light imaging — we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries .
this is called synchrotron radiation , and it 's normally used to look at things like proteins and that sort of thing .
so what did we discover ?
now hyperides was an athenian orator from the fourth century b.c .
`` and this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial — and it 's a great speech : `` '' best of all , '' '' he says , `` '' is to win . ''
he lived for another 10 years , then the macedonian faction caught up with him .
and we found three .
( applause ) why did the owner of the manuscript do this ?
and if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the web , at the moment you have to go to the national library of y 's site or the university library of x 's site , which is about the most boring way in which you can deal with digital data .
what 's in it for the institution ?
why do they go to see the mona lisa ?
( applause )
now , i mention squeak because sebastian 's first guest happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen , and she promised that she would refrain from leaving a bad review on one condition : he got a cat .
it 's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption , and , through it , people like sebastian are becoming micro-entrepreneurs .
they 're empowered to make money and save money from their existing assets .
it 's using the power of technology to build trust between strangers .
it 's about empowering people to make meaningful connections , connections that are enabling us to rediscover a humanness that we 've lost somewhere along the way , by engaging in marketplaces like airbnb , like kickstarter , like etsy , that are built on personal relationships versus empty transactions .
now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back to old market principles and collaborative behaviors that are hard-wired in all of us .
they 're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant for the facebook age .
meet 46-year-old chris mok , who has , i bet , the best job title here of superrabbit .
now the way taskrabbit works is , people outsource the tasks that they want doing , name the price they 're willing to pay , and then vetted rabbits bid to run the errand .
i actually came across this fascinating study by the pew center this week that revealed that an active facebook user is three times as likely as a non-internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy .
now , with all of my optimism , and i am an optimist , comes a healthy dose of caution , or rather , an urgent need to address some pressing , complex questions .
how do we stop people who 've behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise ?
but the most important thing that we have to keep in mind is that reputation is largely contextual .
now the interesting thing is , reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .
but the bigger principle of what 's happening behind stack overflow , i think , is incredibly exciting .
in the 20th century , the invention of traditional credit transformed our consumer system , and in many ways controlled who had access to what .
thank you .
you can burst bubbles .
shake it , and you have a lesbian couple .
`` you know the hindus are killing us muslims . be careful . '' '' i 'm like , `` '' dude , i 'm hindu . '' '' ( laughter ) he 's like , `` '' huh ! '' '' you know , my work is inspired by events such as this . ''
( applause ) you have to separate fact from bias , right .
i 'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .
hi . i 'm kevin allocca , i 'm the trends manager at youtube , and i professionally watch youtube videos .
it 's true .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
and if you 're wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
there were remixes .
an entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
( video ) casey niestat : so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
no one has to green-light your idea .
jm : now a little piece of career advice .
1920s — the charleston .
the charleston was all about improvisation and musicality , making its way into lindy hop , swing dancing and even the kid n play , originally called the funky charleston .
now , social dance is about community and connection ; if you knew the steps , it meant you belonged to a group .
so , this simple narrative equating western demand and chinese suffering is appealing , especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world , but it 's also inaccurate and disrespectful .
everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances , and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural china .
karl marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism , the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor .
but like so many theories that marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the british museum , he got this one wrong .
journalistic coverage of chinese factories , on the other hand , plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make .
the workers i got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor .
once , when min 's older sister 's friend got married , she brought a handbag along as a wedding present .
six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair .
`` they were fresh , functional , and women everywhere adored them . a new american classic was born . '' '' i wonder what karl marx would have made of min and her sisters . ''
very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be .
they usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade .
lc : oh definitely , definitely . i mean , you know , it was interesting , because i spent basically two years hanging out in this city , dongguan , and over that time , you could see immense change in every person 's life : upward , downward , sideways , but generally upward .
ca : thanks so much for your talk .
`` i can not tell you the hundreds of people who have said , `` if you do n't like religion , just leave . '' ''
why would you try to change it ?
in fact , my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation .
how many lives did that affect ?
a button , two guitar picks and lots of hot glue .
yes , macy ?
i 'm freezing .
yes , oh the cold is for the machines , the new technology . okay .
do i offer to host this guy ?
did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent ?
now , when you 're faced with a problem , you fall back on what you know , and all we really knew was design .
could design make that happen ?
the right design can actually help us overcome one of our most deeply rooted biases .
`` if you share too little , like , `` '' yo , '' '' acceptance rates go down . ''
this is a graph that shows our rate of adoption .
how do sharing and transactions go together ?
or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant ?
what if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up ?
so , why did ours eventually take off ?
it blows my mind .
it 's given to you . it 's a gift .
we so rarely look at the sky .
we so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment , with clouds coming and going .
and i plucked the hair off the fly 's head .
and that 's 24-karat gold . and it 's constructed . i built it .
( applause )
it works really well , as you can see .
the government calls these units communications management units or cmus .
there are 2 cmus .
that came as quite a shock .
journalists are not allowed here .
some are just givers who got burned one too many times .
and i found that most people are right in the middle between giving and taking .
ok , it would have been more before we talked about these data .
she 's not a high-powered political staffer , nor a lobbyist .
we were a really enthusiastic group of kids , and we raised more money than any other school in australia .
we were taken into a slum in the outskirts of manila .
`` `` '' smoky mountain '' '' was what they called it . ''
we needed a sustainable movement , not one that is susceptible to the fluctuating moods of a politician or the hint of an economic downturn .
it had to be part of their identity .
it 's not that people do n't want to act .
we 're already everywhere .
that 's when she got active on social media and started to collect pennies — a lot of pennies .
there was no social media .
so in the months and years ahead , global citizens will hold world leaders accountable to ensure that the new global goals for sustainable development are tracked and implemented .
are you ?
thank you .
and the desalination process is one where we take out salts .
removing the salts from water — particularly seawater — through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe .
and singapore proposes by 2060 to produce [ 900 ] million liters per day of desalinated water .
so what we 're doing at the moment is we 're accumulating metals like calcium , potassium and magnesium from out of desalination brine .
so , cells are happily functioning in our bodies .
guess what . they do n't .
what about animal testing ?
well , animals do and can provide extremely useful information .
they 're in dynamic environments in our body .
there 's been many people trying to grow cells in the lab .
they 've tried many different approaches .
in the center , we have a porous , flexible membrane on which we can add human cells from , say , our lungs , and then underneath , they had capillary cells , the cells in our blood vessels .
there 's air flowing through the top channel , and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients through the blood channel .
now the chip is really beautiful , but what can we do with it ?
we can get incredible functionality inside these little chips .
and you can see here , we can actually visualize a single white blood cell .
in that tiny chip , you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection .
it 's pretty exciting .
when they get damaged , say , by cigarette smoke for example , they do n't work properly , and they ca n't clear that mucus out .
now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome .
now , the true power of this technology , however , really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them .
we 're not going to ever recreate a whole human in these chips , but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what 's going to happen in humans .
we could test the safety of chemicals that we are exposed to on a daily basis in our environment , such as chemicals in regular household cleaners .
they may not respond in the same way adults do .
this could really change the way we do clinical trials .
it creates an easy user interface .
so a cell biologist like me can come in , take a chip , put it in a cartridge like the prototype you see there , put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a c.d. , and away you go .
plug and play . easy .
it would be a personalized chip just for you .
well , we could imagine one day having geraldine on a chip , having danielle on a chip , having you on a chip .
a face without a name might help them feel just a little less attached .
2.6 million .
and the tools we did have could n't differentiate between the cancer cells that we wanted to hit hard and those healthy cells that we wanted to preserve .
it 's a drug called herceptin .
and that precision let us hit hard the cancer cells , while sparing and being more gentle on the normal cells .
it was a terrible time .
so ...
now , put yourself in the shoes of that mom .
and why would we stop there ?
or as a philanthropist that 's now given away serious money ?
we pioneered the concept of women going back into the workforce after a career break .
indeed , i could n't open a bank account without my husband 's permission .
and i 've just started a three-year think tank for autism .
giles died unexpectedly 17 years ago now .
philanthropy is all that i do now .
and i looked to my left and saw this very arresting image .
i made contact with a child from swat who studied in a madrassa like this .
hazrat ali : they first call us to the mosque and preach to us .
then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the koran .
ha : they teach us to use machine guns , kalashnikov , rocket launchers , grenades , bombs .
effectively , this is the brainwashing process that has begun .
he blew himself up , killing six .
soc : what blessing would you get from carrying out a suicide attack ?
`` ( music : `` '' a clean break ( let 's work ) '' '' by talking heads ) so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood . ''
and there was n't a lot of reverberation in the room .
so the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
this is tootsie 's orchid lounge in nashville .
do i have a place , a venue , in mind when i write ?
do we all make things with a venue , a context , in mind ?
there 's no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
the instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc. , etc .
and it would be a mess in a context like this . this is a gothic cathedral .
this is the kind of rooms that mozart wrote in .
people in the audience in these opera houses , when they were built , they used to yell out to one another .
obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
`` ( music : `` '' symphony no . 8 in e flat major '' '' by gustav mahler ) this is mahler . ''
[ live music ] does n't really change that much .
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music .
`` ( music : `` '' my funny valentine '' '' by chet baker ) this is chet baker . ''
it 's more a social situation than a musical situation .
and in some ways , the music that they 're writing for this place works perfectly .
but now that 's evolved into something else .
presumably , this is just for christian music .
in other ways , it 's more like the west african music because if the music in an mp3 player gets too quiet , you turn it up , and the next minute , your ears are blasted out by a louder passage .
so that does n't really work .
and the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls , so that they do n't get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor .
i 'm saying the two , the passion , the joy , are not mutually exclusive .
and then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety and made sure i was going to be all right , he drove off again .
and the answer may be that the brains of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways .
maybe .
thank you .
it 's done by geologists , engineers , biologists , all sorts of different people — modeling and simulation .
lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world , except if you 're learning it .
see , crucial point here : math is not equal to calculating .
now it 's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years .
calculating was typically the limiting step , and now often it is n't .
it 's still quicker to do that and more practical .
`` so my usual question is , what do you mean by `` '' basics ? '' '' basics of what ? ''
are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill ?
when they 're out of education , they do it on a computer .
why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway ?
you can make it a quartic equation . make it kind of harder , calculating-wise .
they 've got hair all over them .
i do n't think so — quite the opposite .
i ca n't think of any other subject where that 's recently been possible .
well , it 's damn hard doing the calculations , that 's the problem .
and one of the reasons it 's so important — so it 's very important to get computers in exams .
this is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens .
we have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward , and also our societies , based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics .
we can engage so many more students with this , and they can have a better time doing it .
and let 's understand : this is not an incremental sort of change .
but the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity .
i felt like i could n't just reject my neurologist 's diagnosis .
the cure was marriage and motherhood .
when i began investigating the history of my own disease , i was amazed to find how deep these ideas still run .
this was not just lightning .
the ignorance surrounding my disease has been a choice , a choice made by the institutions that were supposed to protect us .
so many diseases were once thought of as psychological until science uncovered their biological mechanisms .
me has never benefited from the kind of science that other diseases have had , but that 's starting to change .
online we came together , and we shared our stories .
i had a sick body ; that was all .
`` we need to listen to patients ' stories , and we need to be willing to say , `` '' i do n't know . '' '' `` `` i do n't know '' '' is a beautiful thing . ''
matt mills : now , what 's great about this is , there 's no trickery here .
again , the thing that 's incredible about this is this is how advanced these devices have become .
all the processing to do that was actually done on the device itself .
now , this has applications everywhere , whether in things like art in museums , like you just saw , or in the world of , say , advertising , or print journalism .
voice : ... to the grass , and it 's very important that you adapt and you , you have to be flexible , you have to be willing to change direction at a split second , and she does all that . she 's won this title .
they 're not very animated . ( laughter ) this was the fourth take , i 'm told . ( laughter ) okay . so , as we 're talking about cambridge , let 's now move on to technical advancements , because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago , the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate , and that means that i can now take cinema-quality 3d models and place them in the world around me , so i have one over here .
child : tv . ( children react ) child : oh my god .
child : oh , that is so cool .
okay , so are you all ready ?
we 're all very , very familiar with the internet .
oh , there we are . we can save it now .
the only difference is that you 've got the ability to add in links and slightly more content . are you now ready ?
tamara roukaerts : we 're ready to go .
now some of you will be wondering what marmite is .
he very carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book .
cochrane , he starts ranting at these germans in this scottish accent — in fluent german , by the way , but in a scottish accent — and explains to them how german culture was the culture that gave schiller and goethe to the world .
`` but a young german doctor picks up archie cochrane 's exercise book and says to his colleagues , `` '' this evidence is incontrovertible . ''
he called it the god complex .
and doctors suffer from the god complex a lot .
so it 'll show you gdp per capita , population , longevity , that 's about it .
this is produced by the physicist cesar hidalgo .
cesar has trolled the database of over 5,000 different products , and he 's used techniques of network analysis to interrogate this database and to graph relationships between the different products .
in about the length of this session , you would have counted all 5,000 .
now imagine doing the same thing for every different type of product on sale in walmart .
it 's even more difficult in edinburgh because you have to count all the whisky and the tartan .
this perhaps is why we find the god complex so tempting .
but the way we solve them is with humility — to abandon the god complex and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works .
this baby was produced through trial and error .
how do you do it ?
now this process of trial and error is actually far more common in successful institutions than we care to recognize .
ten percent of americans do n't disappear every year .
when schools stop doing that all the time , i will admit that , yes , it 's obvious that trial and error is a good thing .
there 's this one trial he ran many years after world war ii .
should they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital , or should they recover at home ?
all the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down .
`` and then he says , `` '' well that 's very interesting , gentlemen , because when i gave you the table of results , i swapped the two columns around . ''
cochrane understood that uncertainty , that fallibility , that being challenged , they hurt .
and you sometimes need to be shocked out of that .
none of the women i had grown up with in maryland had graduated from college , let alone considered business school .
but they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent .
business , she said , was critical to her country 's future .
and that was actually an excellent business , because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood .
`` i went on to bosnia , and early on in my interviews i met with an imf official who said , `` '' you know , gayle , i do n't think we actually have women in business in bosnia , but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road . ''
by the time we met , she had 20 employees , most of them women , who were sending their boys and their girls to school .
i met women running essential oils businesses , wineries and even the country 's largest advertising agency .
first of all , for exceptions , there are a lot of them and they 're important .
and finally , there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional .
this topic of resilience is very personal to me and in many ways has shaped my life .
`` and when i complained to my grandmother , a world war ii veteran who worked in film for 50 years and who supported me from the age of 13 , that i was terrified that if i turned down a plum assignment at abc for a fellowship overseas , i would never ever , ever find another job , she said , `` '' kiddo , i 'm going to tell you two things . ''
the women in this room and watching in l.a .
we are not a special interest group .
we are the majority .
( applause )
and , in a way , it was buckminster fuller who coined that phrase .
so what 's worldchanging ?
they live in the emerging megacities of the developing world .
so i rather like this picture here .
i call it the golden circle .
it 's all grounded in the tenets of biology .
they 've never made money .
how many of them showed up for him ?
and in that moment , i feel like a millionaire .
everyone 's upset .
and one time , when he finally got his box of frosted flakes back , it was crawling with roaches .
two hundred years ago , the united states was less than a few percent urbanized .
it 's now more than 82 percent .
china 's building 300 new cities in the next 20 years .
because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people , creating ideas , innovation , wealth and so on .
this work has been done with an extraordinary group of people , and they 've done all the work , and i 'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together .
the 10 billion people on the planet in 2050 want to live in places like this , having things like this , doing things like this , with economies that are growing like this , not realizing that entropy produces things like this , this , this and this .
and you see , you 're very familiar with this .
you grow very quickly and then you stop .
it 's particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms , each subsystem , each cell type , each gene , has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history .
there is a scaling .
there is an economy of scale .
this is just european countries , but you do it in japan or china or colombia , always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree .
and any infrastructure you look at — whether it 's the length of roads , length of electrical lines — anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way .
it 's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on .
but most important in this , the exponent , the analog to that three-quarters for the metabolic rate , is bigger than one — it 's about 1.15 to 1.2 .
and here , they 're all plotted together .
just to show you what we plotted , here is income , gdp — gdp of the city — crime and patents all on one graph .
this 15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet — japan , chile , portugal , scotland , does n't matter .
the universality , to repeat , is us — that we are the city .
if it 's social networks with super-linear scaling — more per capita — then the theory says that you increase the pace of life .
economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior .
so the image is that we 're not only on a treadmill that 's going faster , but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster .
this happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees .
that 's what we like , hockey sticks .
blah blah blah , blah .
so what the hell was that ?
it was n't clear .
so clarity .
this led me to graffiti .
kind of a fun thing to do .
and we struggled with the image .
if any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
so that was n't going to work .
i 'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36 , which was only four percent of the population , so now i 'm dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men .
so that basically meant there were 35 men for me that i could possibly date in the entire city of philadelphia .
so i decided to sign on .
i talked a lot about javascript .
who are all of the other women on these dating sites ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) and as it turns out , lots and lots of men wanted to date me .
he made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
it 's just not the ones that we 're being presented with online .
how is that possible ? many people just think it is n't possible at all .
in my childhood , i played around in my father 's university lab .
so it was taken for granted that i attend some of the best universities , which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity .
let 's talk about what 's suddenly possible .
ezekiel emanuel : fifty million people are uninsured .
scott klemmer : so bush imagined that in the future , you 'd wear a camera right in the center of your head .
and these would be real homework assignments for a real grade , with a real deadline .
some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit .
let 's talk a little bit about some of the components that go into these courses .
the answer is , you need to use technology to do it for you .
in addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video , we can also grade math , mathematical expressions as well as mathematical derivations .
and so , the student tries again , and now they got it right , and they 're told that , and they can move on to the next assignment .
specifically , what 's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work that is so essential in such disciplines as the humanities , the social sciences , business and others .
around each one of our courses , a community of students had formed , a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor .
you can use these data to understand fundamental questions like , what are good learning strategies that are effective versus ones that are not ?
but when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer , it 's kind of hard to miss .
so andrew and his students went in , looked at some of those assignments , understood the root cause of the misconception , and then they produced a targeted error message that would be provided to every student whose answer fell into that bucket , which means that students who made that same mistake would now get personalized feedback telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively .
so how do we do that ?
think about your week so far .
if you look at the far end of this graph , you can see the netherlands and korea are in single figures .
and i think as social animals , we share this fascination about how we as individuals relate to our groups , to our peers .
and statistics in this way are at their most powerful when they surprise us .
( laughter ) so again , a big variation .
so extraordinary variations , and surprising to some , but not surprising to people who have read the work of daniel kahneman , for example , the nobel-winning economist .
and there are many reasons for this .
not very well , it turns out . i ca n't do that .
i wanted everyone to engage with it .
how about the next question ?
and it sparked an enormous discussion online , on social media , which was largely dominated by people having fun with their misconceptions , which is something that i could n't have hoped for any better , in some respects .
although for two years , we were like prisoners at home .
the economy is completely broken , and people are still fighting .
allow me an aside .
our built environment matters .
we can learn from this .
thank you for listening .
that looks like a coastline .
i mean , this is something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go .
this uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car , which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build , but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation .
thank you .
well , it turns out that we do have something just like that : our gut , or rather , its microbes .
they help educate our immune system .
and what it turns out to be is that those , as the different regions of the body , have very different microbes in them .
you 're 99.99 percent identical in terms of your human dna to the person sitting next to you .
so i 'm just going to start this going and we 'll see how that happens .
and then in mice , we can do a lot more .
so you might be wondering whether we can also do this sort of thing across species , and it turns out that if you take microbes from an obese person and transplant them into mice you 've raised germ-free , those mice will also become fatter than if they received the microbes from a lean person , but we can design a microbial community that we inoculate them with that prevents them from gaining this weight .
he was saving lives with this machine .
with that guy 's data ?
but that 's not a usual case in history .
he wanted to be a chef really badly .
change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks , through facebook , through twitter , through youtube , through reddit , through tumblr , through whatever you can think of .
people online , and sometimes even in real life , were disrespectful to me and my family , and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time , and it really discouraged me .
it hurt me , and it made me think , what 's the point of making change in the future ?
but then i started to realize something .
and that spark that you 've been hearing about all day today , you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire .
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .
color without pigments : this peacock is creating color with shape .
this is a huge and important one , number 11 .
the british association for the advancement of science is holding its third meeting at the university of cambridge .
the members of the association are shocked to realize that it 's the poet samuel taylor coleridge , who had n't even left his house in years until that day .
they 're even more shocked by what he says .
charles babbage , i think known to most tedsters , invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer .
richard jones became an important economist who later influenced karl marx .
it was time for a new revolution , which they pledged to bring about , and what 's so amazing about these guys is , not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams , but they actually carried them out , even beyond their wildest dreams .
the members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed .
the philosophical breakfast club changed that , working together .
this is the one now at the computer history museum in california , and it calculates accurately . it actually works .
these grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research , but they also encouraged thinking outside the box , rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question .
and then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle .
and that comes down right way to the present with the dollar bill in the united states , which has on it an eye of providence .
because it 's the first thing we draw ; we surround ourselves with images of it ; it 's probably the most common image on the planet .
but we do n't . we take our consciousness for granted .
and the reason i 'm so honored to be here to talk today in india is because india has the sad distinction of being the head injury capital of the world .
and here are some of the other categories , if you look at the whole planet .
we find that the number two source of disability is depression in the age group of 15 to 44 .
so what you 'd be wondering , watching the human show , is are we going to confront and address the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way by growing our consciousness , or are we going to continue to retreat ?
it 's the what our minds do every night to digest the day and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we 're asleep to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning .
but if you look into the eye of consciousness , that single eye you can see , i 'm looking down , but let me tell you how i felt at that point .
so from this experience of my recovery , i want to share four particular aspects — i call them the four c 's of consciousness — that helped me grow my potential mind back towards the actual mind that i work with every day .
i 'm not a doctor , so i 'm not going to talk about the various subtests .
then i underwent cognitive training .
the answer is yes , and for the first time , it 's my pleasure to be able to share two examples .
but that person could be identified as having a learning disability .
two elements that worked for me here are — the first is 90 percent , i learned , of head and neck pain is through muscular-skeletal imbalance .
he then held my jaw in the right position while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment .
this affected my entire body .
i still had migraine headaches .
communication , the next c. this is critical .
it has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free for over 80 years .
is this science fiction ? no , because i 'm wearing the first application of this technology .
in my coma , one of the presences i sensed was someone i felt was a protector .
and i whispered the good news through my broken jaw , which was wired shut , to my night nurse .
you know , when i heard simon 's — please sit down ; i just want to talk to him for a second — when i read his book , i went to la to meet him .
that little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on .
and that 's my friend . i mean , i charge it every night .
and it works . it works .
what does it do ? well actually , i 'll show you down here .
when i was a kid , the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war .
if anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades , it 's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war .
i 'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper , lots of tough challenges .
we did n't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go , who would have gone , seen what the disease was , seen how far it had spread .
and a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers .
you can have a virus where people feel well enough while they 're infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market .
the source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like ebola , or it could be bioterrorism .
so they are absolutely ready to go .
that 's where mothers can give birth safely , kids can get all their vaccines .
finally , we need lots of advanced r & d in areas of vaccines and diagnostics .
there 's no need to panic .
but we need to get going , because time is not on our side .
now , when you 're in the middle of that scene and you hear those sounds , and you see the injured around you , it 's an incredibly scary and real feeling .
`` things like , `` '' it 's so real , '' '' `` '' absolutely believable , '' '' or , of course , the one that i was excited about , `` '' a real feeling as if you were in the middle of something that you normally see on the tv news . '' '' so , it works , right ? this stuff works . ''
now , do n't get me wrong — i 'm not saying that when you 're in a piece you forget that you 're here .
we can have what i call this duality of presence , and i think that 's what allows me to tap into these feelings of empathy .
we put other sounds in there to distract them , and all they 're doing is lying listening to sounds .
you can see physically , people become more stressed .
ice .
( laughter ) he 's starting to go now .
it was a very basic reaction to find some reason we can do this .
yes , 11 .
we were information sharing . we were crucial .
`` `` do not let your brother oppress another . '' ''
policies were changed .
so really , the united nations just copied us .
conservatives will call you a lot of colorful things .
they did n't teach it before then .
`` `` '' why is this so hard ? '' '' you may ask . ''
in fact , it took mother nature 540 million years of hard work to do this task , and much of that effort went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains , not the eyes themselves .
so vision begins with the eyes , but it truly takes place in the brain .
that 's a lot of training examples .
once we know this , we knew we needed to collect a data set that has far more images than we have ever had before , perhaps thousands of times more , and together with professor kai li at princeton university , we launched the imagenet project in 2007 .
we were thrilled to have put together imagenet , and we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it , so in the ted fashion , we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free .
it 's an incredible accomplishment , but it 's only the first step .
soon , another developmental milestone will be hit , and children begin to communicate in sentences .
( video ) computer : a young boy is holding a baseball bat .
what the computer does n't see is that this is a special italian cake that 's only served during easter time .
four years ago today , exactly , actually , i started a fashion blog called style rookie .
what makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses , who has flaws , who is maybe not immediately likable , but eventually relatable .
and this is an excerpt from my first editor 's letter , where i say that rookie , we do n't have all the answers , we 're still figuring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and rookie , i think we 've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
so what i you to take away from my talk , the lesson of all of this , is to just be stevie nicks .
like , that 's all you have to do . ( laughter ) because my favorite thing about her , other than , like , everything , is that she is very — has always been unapologetically present on stage , and unapologetic about her flaws and about reconciling all of her contradictory feelings and she makes you listen to them and think about them , and yeah , so please be stevie nicks .
and this makes for a very short mission life .
and this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity .
and what they 're doing is essentially building a map of the orchard .
but there is a new , technological institution that will fundamentally change how we exchange value , and it 's called the blockchain .
these institutions are really the grease that allow our economic wheels to function , and we can see this play out over the course of human history .
i think it 's closest in description to something like wikipedia .
we can see everything on wikipedia .
there are of course other technical details to the blockchain , but at its core , that 's how it works .
blockchains allow for us to create an open , global platform on which to store any attestation about any individual from any source .
it 's a shared database , and even though it has multiple readers and multiple writers at the same time , it has one single truth .
( applause )
now , i think this is a really cool story in and of itself , but it gets more awesome .
they actually love it .
( applause )
this would let us turn visible objects into visual microphones from a distance .
but there 's another important way that we learn about the world : that 's by interacting with it .
and that 's something that video still wo n't let us do , at least not traditionally .
what about full knee replacements , from your data , made to measure , where all of the tools and guides are 3d printed ?
google is taking on this very audacious project of making the block phone , the ara .
and that gets me to one of the biggest deals about 3d printing .
last year , i went on my first book tour .
what makes america home for me is not my passport or accent , but these very particular experiences and the places they occur .
my question really is , where is all the female superhero stuff ?
for my little sister , she ended up being pregnant .
it was very hard , but we pushed .
in the center of this cloud , our sun formed and ignited .
so it 's a very fresh comet .
here you see in white the trajectory , and the way this works .
we had to do eight maneuvers , and you see here , some of them were really big .
at that time , we had seen the comet at all kinds of angles , and we could use this technique to map the whole thing .
now , this led to a selection of landing sites .
we had 60 days , and that was it .
i wo n't bore you with all the details of all the instruments , but it 's got everything .
this is a comet day .
that was discarded because it was way too expensive .
for a month and a half , i could n't think about landing day without crying , and i still have the emotion in me .
and well , of course , the dutch ca n't eat all these pigs .
they eat about one-third , and the rest is exported to all kinds of countries in europe and the rest of the world .
a lot goes to the u.k. , germany .
you probably start the day with a shower .
then , at breakfast , the pig that i followed , the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an improver of dough .
well , when you 're off to work , under the road or under the buildings that you see , there might very well be cellular concrete , which is a very light kind of concrete that 's actually got proteins from bones inside and it 's also fully reusable .
in sandpaper , bone glue is actually the glue between the sand and the paper .
this is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the united states .
`` but they answered and they said , `` '' why , thank you for your email . what an interesting story . ''
it 's actually a very low-tech and very high-tech product at the same time .
and what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery .
well it is , because everything that ca n't be used for anything else is made into a fuel that can be used as renewable energy source .
nonviolent campaigns are also less likely to cause physical harm to those waging the campaign , as well as their opponents .
the proposed route would require the destruction of this community 's olive groves , their cemeteries and would ultimately close the village from all sides .
i 've been talking a lot about my experiences in the middle east , and some of you might be thinking now that the solution then is for us to educate muslim and arab societies to be more inclusive of their women .
in the late 1980s , an uprising started in gaza , and quickly spread to the west bank and east jerusalem .
it came to be known as the first intifada , and people who have any visual memory of it generally conjure up something like this : palestinian men throwing rocks at israeli tanks .
that 's why we look different .
but it 's not just skin-deep .
( cheering ) sebastian seung : what am i ?
and in the 1970s and '80s , a team of scientists mapped all 7,000 connections between the neurons .
we do n't know for sure , but there are theories .
since the 19th century , neuroscientists have speculated that maybe your memories — the information that makes you , you — maybe your memories are stored in the connections between your brain 's neurons .
in order to find connectomes , we have to see all the neurons at the same time .
so let 's meet bobby kasthuri , who works in the laboratory of jeff lichtman at harvard university .
well , we take this three-dimensional stack of images and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book .
( laughter ) according to this self-help book , guys brains are like waffles ; they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes .
just as one strand of spaghetti contacts many other strands on your plate , one neuron touches many other neurons through their entangled branches .
and so let 's do a series of comparisons to show you .
for now , let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis , that it 's actually worth taking seriously .
and synapses can grow larger , and they can grow smaller .
and as i told you just now , neural activity can change the connectome .
and if you 'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights , i will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis — or so neuroscientists think — of thoughts , feelings and perceptions .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
neural activity is its water , and the connectome is its bed .
according to a theory that dates back to the 19th century , such memories are stored as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain .
( laughter ) i estimate , millions of miles , all packed in your skull .
i propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain .
connectomes will mark a turning point in human history .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?
and they could use those for practice balls .
so i sold lots and lots of sunglasses .
that 's wrong , for me , if you want to raise entrepreneurs .
i 've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk .
we ca n't pick the future , but we can steer the future .
the first tunnels date back to 60 b.c .
i was 13 months when they removed my left eye .
think for a moment about your own impressions of blindness .
dk : yes ! sm : that 's amazing .
j. louchart : i love being blind .
if i had the opportunity , honestly , i would n't go back to being sighted .
as i know you can see , it 's a spectacular standing ovation at ted .
one of my students , who has now become an instructor , when he lost his vision , after a few months he was sitting in his three story house and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house : conversations , people in the kitchen , people in the bathroom , several floors away , several walls away .
how do you picture this theater ?
i hear every little movement that every single person makes .
none of it really escapes my attention , and then , from a sonar perspective , the size of the room , the curvature of the audience around the stage , it 's the height of the room .
so momentum is good . do n't stop .
sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction .
we 've met a lot of people .
imagine if we also considered the front end of this prison pipeline .
the talent is abundant behind prison walls .
wo n't you help to sing these songs of freedom ?
have no fear for atomic energy 'cause none of them can stop the time .
but when i was little , i remember , he would kill flies in our house with my bb gun .
and what was amazing to me — well it was pretty kickass ; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun — but what was so amazing to me was that he knew just enough how to pump it .
i love contemporary art , but i 'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world and the contemporary art scene .
but two of the main things : one of it , i was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public , that was accessible .
and what that is is i imagine explaining a work of art to my grandmother in five minutes , and if i ca n't explain it in five minutes , then it 's too obtuse or esoteric and it has n't been refined enough yet .
`` it would have `` '' heart '' '' in that it would have passion and heart and soul . ''
i 'm just going to make the whole thing myself .
and i 'm going to create this in two years , and i have .
i know i should mention : i 'm making all these things .
this is nell remmel .
nell is interested in agricultural processes , and her work is based in these practices .
one of these is scratch-off masterpieces .
he had to break off a piece to get out of egypt recently .
`` so they came up with `` '' dig jigs . '' '' and a dig jig — a dig jig is where , for a milestone anniversary or a birthday , you gather all your friends and family together and you dance on where you 're going to be buried . ''
i talked my family into doing this , and they did n't know what i was doing .
`` and i was like , `` '' get dressed for a funeral . we 're going to go do some work . '' '' and so we got to the grave and made this , which was hilarious — the attention that we got . ''
and you in essence have a funeral that you get to be present for .
and he pairs these up with paintings .
this is one of their founders , gert schaeffer .
`` next is an australian artist , janeen jackson , and this is from a project of hers called `` '' what an artwork does when we 're not watching . '' '' ( laughter ) next is by a lithuanian fortune teller , jurgi petrauskas . ''
and i have to say , vera kind of scares me .
( laughter ) and she 's an optometrist in st. petersburg , and she plays with optics .
and through all of this , i had to hold a torch between my teeth .
i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points .
i think there 's nothing like a crisis to tell you what 's really important and what 's not , and sandy made me realize that our devices and their connectivity matter to us right up there with food and shelter .
a novel needs scene after scene to build , and the story of our life needs an arc as well .
it needs months and years .
now the self that experiences directly can only exist in the moment , but the one that narrates needs several moments , a whole sequence of them , and that 's why our full sense of self needs both immersive experience and the flow of time .
you and i answer only to nature 's rhythm and flow , to the sun , the moon and the seasons , and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past , the present and the future to see things for what they are , to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations .
this is because time does n't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one .
news from india is a stream on my smartphone app whether i 'm in new york or new delhi .
your last job , your dinner reservations from last year , your former friends , lie on a flat plain with today 's friends , because the internet also archives , and it warps the past .
every digital landmark is an invitation to leave what you are doing now to go somewhere else and do something else .
are you reading an interview by an author ?
and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror .
there were those with power and water , and those without .
now if this rift , which is already so great in many parts of the world , between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology , is n't somehow bridged , there will be ruptures between the digital and the real .
if i were a child today , i could easily learn this information with apps and hyperlinks , but it really would n't be the same , because much later , i went to vienna , and i went to the spanish riding school , and i could feel my grandfather right beside me .
they 're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them .
it can not be stored .
the present joins a flow of time from before and after .
i wanted to learn to skip , and she found an old rope and she tucked up her sari and she jumped over it .
my grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take , that time ca n't be fought , and because it will pass and it will move , we owe the present moment our full attention .
but we do n't need to let it .
i 'm going to be talking to you about how we can tap a really underutilized resource in health care , which is the patient , or , as i like to use the scientific term , people .
you 're looking at things where people are actually given information , and they 're not following through with it .
we talk about it in terms of engagement , or non-compliance .
but they have really taken this problem of behavior change and solved it .
that was the message . that was the experiment .
they wanted to capture one other variable , which was the patients ' sense of efficacy .
it was the sense of efficacy .
in health care terms , you could characterize this as whether or not somebody feels that they see a path towards better health , that they can actually see their way towards getting better health , and that 's a very important notion .
so let me just spool it out a little bit .
there 's an emotional connection to information because it 's from us .
so i 'm going to give you an example , a very simple example of how this works .
we always are . we 're always going above the speed limit .
we either keep going fast , or we slow down .
so i want to talk about , i want to shift now to think about how we deliver health information in this country , how we actually get information .
because we know .
god forbid we should use that same standard that we make cap'n crunch live by and bring it to drug companies .
it says very clearly what the drug is for , specifically who it is good for , so you can start to personalize your understanding of whether the information is relevant to you or whether the drug is relevant to you .
every time you take a drug , you 're walking into a possible side effect .
and so i was thinking about , what 's an opportunity that i could have to help people understand information ?
they 're packed with information .
this is our one-page summary .
then you can drill down and understand how actually we put your level in context , and we use color to illustrate exactly where your value falls .
and then we do two other very important things that kind of help fill in this feedback loop : we help people understand in a little more detail what these values are and what they might indicate .
we give them some insight into what choices they can make , what actions they can take .
so we take the bold step of putting the cholesterol information on the same page , which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it .
so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well .
we again personalized the risks .
it works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today .
the rest , we all share it .
we started from the beginning , from common traits .
too dark .
the prediction will get better , the model will get more precise .
and it 's a revolution that can not be confined in the domain of science or technology .
thank you .
now what could this mean ?
so how are we doing this in the lab ?
well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
when paul also graduated from colorado state university , he paid for his english degree by working part-time .
getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off with the increased income that you earned from it .
so ...
tuition costs up , public funding down , family incomes diminished , personal incomes weak .
i want to speak of three of them today .
that 's not just cynical marketing , that 's cruel .
that is manifestly unfair , and should change .
my students and i work on very tiny robots .
so one of the big contributions from my lab has been to combine rigid and soft materials in very , very small mechanisms .
so this is aaron , the graduate student in question , with the tweezers , and what you see is this four-millimeter-sized mechanism jumping almost 40 centimeters high .
everything is onboard , and it jumped in response to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it .
i do n't think so . i do n't think it 's going to get to that extreme .
we 're at a park , and our kid is swinging on the swing .
but i also had noticed that it was n't working .
and i said — very last minute — you know , you really should share that story .
pm : and in the book , you not only found your voice , which is clear and strong in the book , but you also share what you 've learned — the experiences of other people in the lessons .
so i do n't know if i 'm an expert , or if anyone is an expert . i certainly have done a lot of research .
all over the world , no matter what our cultures are , we think men should be strong , assertive , aggressive , have voice ; we think women should speak when spoken to , help others .
people have actually been working on this for decades .
speaking of kitchens , here 's some asparagus .
so here 's the question : can we grow axons and neurons down these channels ?
so , the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking .
why this crisis ?
but to do that , you have to put energy in your arm .
many times i go around the world to speak , and people ask me questions about the challenges , my moments , some of my regrets .
i went to northern liberia .
`` the night before i left , she came to the room and said , `` '' leymah , do n't leave me here . ''
every night i 'd come from work and lie on the cold floor .
in one community , we 're told , you wake up in the morning and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper .
it 's disheartening , it 's sad .
today , we 've worked with over 300 .
juanita is her name .
i wish for a better life .
this girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry .
this young woman wished also to go to school .
this young woman wished for other things to happen , it happened for her .
right now in liberia , what do you see as the main issue that troubles you ?
rape is not barbaric , but the law , he said , was barbaric .
he 's out of office today .
but even though i had this newfound joy and freedom , people 's reaction completely changed towards me .
i realized i 'd internalized these responses and it had changed who i was on a core level .
i was seeing myself not from my perspective , but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people 's responses to me .
i literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom .
( applause )
we did that .
well , the possibilities are practically endless .
thank you .
we felt helpless .
i 'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine , a bosnian friend , about what happened to her , because i think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like .
and then war and chaos descend .
rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot .
and that was just a small percentage of the dead .
and all i can really do is hope , not to policymakers or politicians , because as much as i 'd like to have faith that they read my words and do something , i do n't delude myself .
this is the skyline of my hometown , new orleans .
half the city is already below sea level .
one thousand , eight hundred and thirty-six people died . nearly 300,000 homes were lost .
in new orleans , the i-10 twin spans , with sections knocked out in katrina , have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge .
now these are examples of new orleans rebuilding in this way , but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind .
for example , in galveston , here 's a resilient home that survived hurricane ike , when others on neighboring lots clearly did not .
imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue .
`` fortunately in 2006 , congress passed the pet evacuation and transportation standards act ( laughter ) — it spells `` '' pets '' '' — to change that . ''
second , preparing for heat and drought .
beyond these technical solutions , our work at the georgetown climate center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change .
again , we start by designing the human into the process .
perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they cheating would-be jihadists .
because what i saw , i 'm convinced , is the future of cooking .
i 'm talking a little too aggressively , whatever , so you know , i slowed down .
i figured it out .
and he stopped doing this .
i 've never seen it . have you ?
and the geese love the lupin bush .
not for the bush , but for the seeds .
think about that for a minute .
but it truly was the best foie gras of my life .
most of what we eat today .
that 's also an insult to history .
jonas salk has a great quote .
do n't you ?
but that 's fascinating , right ?
and i will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria .
in that pool of water , these larvae are concentrated .
so the problem that we face with this is that , throughout the landscape , all these pools of water with the larvae , they are scattered all over the place , which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides .
he 's examining these holes , and now he 's got it already .
in fact , people have told me that now they will enjoy being bitten by mosquitos .
and the question of course is , what would make someone enjoy being bitten by mosquitos ?
thank you .
now , on the video , on the video here , i 'm going to show you exactly the same thing , except that what i 'm showing you on the video happened one hour after i took the tablet .
suggest female sources to reporters and editors .
`` `` '' what do you think of my doublet ? '' '' i asked . ''
so in a sense , she will take away your free will and you will no longer have any control over this hand .
i grew up in a very small village in canada , and i 'm an undiagnosed dyslexic .
i ran away .
`` it ruined my life — ( laughter ) `` '' the inconvenient truth '' '' and mr . gore . ''
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar .
when the turbine drops in , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
there 's nowhere to flush .
and they work . people use them . people are okay .
it 's something you should think about doing .
we manage to keep the garden that was there running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms .
we made space for these guys who are bali 's last black pigs .
this young man is picking organic vegetables .
but you also learn other things .
the yellow box was called the administration complex .
is this doable in your community ?
green school is a model we built for the world .
you ruined my life , but you gave me an incredible future .
i will show you that they know what matters most in a family , even though their family looks a little different .
we included heterosexual couples , where the man for some reason did not have good-quality sperm , and lesbian couples who obviously needed to find sperm elsewhere .
and these stories were highly diverse , but they all had one thing in common : it was a tale of longing for a child and a quest for that child .
now , the boy soon felt sorry , and they made up .
they , above all , wanted to do what 's best for their child .
and their uncertainties were present long before they even were parents .
even 10 years later , they still remember the advice they were given .
so when they thought about the counselor and the advice they were given , we discussed that .
`` like , `` '' milk — is that made in a factory ? '' '' we will say , `` '' no , it comes from cows , '' '' and we will talk about the farmer , and the way the milk ends up in the shop . ''
in that case , bear in mind three things .
work with advice that works for your family .
there 's just one of them .
the rest of the land can be used for something else .
that 's plato , descartes , nietzsche and bill clinton .
( applause )
thank you !
`` `` '' paradise is in this body . ''
it increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease .
when you change your mind about stress , you can change your body 's response to stress .
it 's getting more oxygen to your brain .
the whole night , i was angry .
they gathered . food was cooked .
and suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder .
somehow they agreed to punish only me , and the punishment was purification .
does anybody know ?
no .
thank you so much .
and in the life that everyone sees , who i am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .
see , some people might fear girls not liking them back .
that 's what keeps you from getting help .
sacrifice your ego .
you 're not meant to be static characters .
and here 's what that means for us .
eventually i got an interview .
every monday and thursday , i 'm going use my terminal days .
it 's a very crowded thing that we do .
and more , even when we had thousands of people , 5,000 people , we had two people in the h.r . department , and thankfully one of them has retired .
and in the process , of course , we wanted people to know everything , and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things .
it is one thing to say , we need to recycle the teachers , we need the directors to do more .
so we have violinists teaching math .
things like , how do we measure ourselves as humans ?
it 's something where we keep the brazilian curriculum with 600 tiles of a mosaic , which we want to expose these kids to by the time they 're 17 .
and so the courses are world cup soccer , or building a bicycle .
you ca n't .
i 've spent 59 days on the back of a camel from chad to timbuktu .
and so i 'm writing a new book .
i 'm now working on getting this school system for free out into the world , and i 've found , very interestingly enough , that nobody wants it for free .
but for free , nobody wants it .
you 're running a company with a 90-day mandate .
no one thinks that we 've caught up yet to a world where there 's google and all these technological options .
we put it out there .
this will find its own place .
stop everything . let me do something else .
rs : thank you so much .
there 's another one coming out , she also has a number on her .
in all cases , the life support was removed , and the infants had died .
governments are still incentivized to give .
everybody was blaming everybody else .
it 's about globalization .
this illustration from the financial times post-brexit is really striking .
only then will we truly reconcile democracy and globalization .
and they also used hydrogen from water .
but the thing is , that research did n't really go anywhere .
that 's what we 're doing today .
we believe that this type of technology can actually help us address an issue with agriculture and allow us to create a type of agriculture that 's sustainable , that will allow us to scale to meet the demands of tomorrow .
so how will we scale to meet that demand ?
so let me make this real for you .
ten thousand times over a period of a year .
it was in the books ; it was inside the teacher 's head ; and she needed to go there to get the information , because that 's how you learned .
when i was a kid , we had a set of encyclopedias at my house .
the information was inside my house and it was awesome .
my first year — super gung-ho — going to teach american government , loved the political system .
they produced flyers . they called offices .
`` the older teachers — more experienced — looked at me and went , `` oh , there she is . that 's so cute . she 's trying to get that done . '' ''
but i knew that the kids would show up , and i believed it , and i told them every week what i expected out of them .
from kansas , i moved on to lovely arizona , where i taught in flagstaff for a number of years , this time with middle school students .
could teach them the more exciting topic of geography .
nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer , but they were into it . and i asked them to put their own voice over it .
and they had certain criteria to do it .
they were a little uncomfortable with it , because we 'd never done this before , and they did n't know exactly how to do it .
they can talk — they 're very smooth , and they can write very , very well , but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them .
`` and i said , `` '' go read it . '' '' and they 're like , `` '' oh , that one was n't so awesome . '' '' and then we went to another one — it did n't have great visuals , but it had great information — and spent an hour talking about the learning process , because it was n't about whether or not it was perfect , or whether or not it was what i could create . ''
this is one of my favorite photos , because this was taken on tuesday , when i asked the students to go to the polls .
( applause )
and one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own mris .
they live inside the skeleton .
and it raises a series of , i think , some of the most interesting questions about how we think about medicine in the future .
i 've talked a lot about models . i began this talk with models .
the former is a scale shift . the latter is a perceptual shift .
most people would say for a lot , a lot of money .
but i would have no idea , until later , that he was actually a slave , held by violence in that rice mill since i was in high school .
experts tell us that there 's about 35 million people in slavery today .
but notice the violence that they fear is not the violence of genocide or the wars , it 's everyday violence .
so for me , as a lawyer , of course , my first reaction was to think , well , of course we 've got to change all the laws .
but then i found out , it already is .
but what if there was no law enforcement to protect you ?
in south asia , if you enslave a poor person , you 're at greater risk of being struck by lightning than ever being sent to jail for that crime .
end of story .
but see , the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer , but the poor ca n't pay for it and they 're left totally unprotected and they keep getting thrown to the ground .
while many believe it , few know it .
what you see there is the years passing in seconds .
what you see there is an extraordinary resurgence in the amazon .
but we have something that plays the same role , with much more elegance though : the trees , our good old friends that , like geysers , can transfer an enormous amount of water from the ground into the atmosphere .
you can see the river covering that region which , otherwise , would be a desert . and it is not .
the sprinkler of the garden of eden .
this benefits the very way plants work , which is another ingenious cycle .
`` once , about four years ago , i attended a declamation , of a text by davi kopenawa , a wise representative of the yanomami people , and it went more or less like this : `` '' does n't the white man know that , if he destroys the forest , there will be no more rain ? ''
`` some months later , i met him at another event and said , `` davi , how did you know that if the forest was destroyed , there 'd be no more rain ? '' ''
`` why am i doing all this science to get to a conclusion that he already knows ? '' '' then , something absolutely critical hit me , which is , seeing is believing . ''
out of sight , out of mind .
let 's dive , let 's reach out the reality we live in every day , and look carefully at it , since that 's what we need .
it is a live carpet .
we are tech-arrogant .
imagine what is out there in the amazon forest : 100 trillion . this is greater than the number of stars in the sky .
but when i got there , i found lots of plastic garbage and other debris .
and that same year , 10 years ago , i headed north to the phoenix islands .
and you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up around the 1960s and '70s , and it 's on kind of a nice trajectory right now .
the peaks that do n't come out of the water are the seamounts .
they 're also a country that is in dire danger .
we as a world are faced with a problem .
the president of the maldives conducted a mock cabinet meeting underwater recently to highlight the dire straits of these countries .
and , you know , it did n't seem like a very good deal to me .
and it was primarily because kiribati realized that this was in their own self-interest to do this .
two days after that , he spiked a fever .
he was in the hospital for a week , shaking with chills , dehydrated and delirious , sinking into a coma as his organs failed .
all of that changed when antibiotics arrived .
after all , the first person to receive penicillin , a british policeman named albert alexander , who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye , was infected by doing something very simple .
he walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn .
we all know how hard it is to change a habit .
in just 70 years , we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster .
the past was about delivered wisdom in education .
in the front of her is a table .
the audience and the performer make the piece together .
i study the brain .
i 'm not a pollyanna ; there 's a great deal to cry about .
thank you .
esther ?
but i was intrigued .
because there are n't very many of them , the pictures that we see on a daily basis tend to be old .
why do these things have to be so expensive ?
so instead , we turned to a new generation of video sensors , originally created for use in night vision goggles .
so we were pretty reassured by this .
just imagine , if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit , to input to print out a document , but the printer does n't have the right drives , so the same is for mario .
i mean , the only real product of our life , at the end , was a failure .
now , the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains , exactly now , as you watch me doing this , you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions .
but one day we found that mario was not looking at our hand .
we were his mirror .
and that day really changed our perspective .
we stopped looking at him as a problem , and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve .
and we thank you so much , all of you .
ff : thank you . rd : thank you . bye .
environmental and health crises are global .
so it seems staggering that journalism has been so late to cover stories in a truly global way .
and this has plunged journalism into crisis , forcing those institutions to reexamine how they function .
panama papers actually allowed the reporters to look at the world through a different lens from everybody else .
but they did n't .
this is the scene in iceland the day after we published .
and there were some unintended consequences .
we put all-important context around what was given to us by john doe .
i guess you 're going to send that applause to the 350 journalists who worked with you , right ?
she could n't wait to get out of her parents ' house , to prove to them that she 's an adult , and to prove to her new friends that she belongs .
she can only remember the night in flashes .
we could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaults just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on .
i have a lighter in my pocket if you need one .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page .
it 's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
i 'm just showing the new york times website here .
and from these , i can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
it 's one metaphor repurposed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
we 'd been on our bikes for around five and half hours when we got to the part of the ride that i loved , and that was the hills , because i loved the hills .
i had extensive and life-threatening injuries .
my whole right side was ripped open , filled with gravel .
why would i want to go back to a body that was so broken ?
after 10 days , i made the decision to return to my body , and the internal bleeding stopped .
`` but then the doctor came over to me , and she said , `` '' janine , the operation was a success , and we 've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could , but the damage is permanent . ''
i shared the ward with five other people , and the amazing thing is that because we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward , we did n't know what each other looked like .
you 're in a wheelchair . that 's normal .
`` but you 're going to get home and realize how different life is . '' '' and i got home and something happened . ''
i did get depressed .
i wanted my old life back . i wanted my body back .
maria was in a car accident , and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic , had no movement from the neck down , had damage to her vocal chords , and she could n't talk .
i had never before thought of myself as a creative person .
i was an athlete . my body was a machine .
`` if i ca n't walk , then i might as well fly . '' '' i said , `` '' mom , i 'm going to learn how to fly . '' '' she said , `` '' that 's nice , dear . '' '' ( laughter ) i said , `` '' pass me the yellow pages . '' '' she passed me the phone book , i rang up the flying school , i made a booking , said i 'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight . ''
`` i 'm going , `` '' wow , how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do ? '' '' andrew the instructor got in the front , started the airplane up . ''
`` he said , `` '' would you like to have a go at taxiing ? '' '' that 's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals to control the airplane on the ground . ''
`` and andrew said to me , as we got over the training area , `` you see that mountain over there ? '' ''
and i took the controls , and i was flying .
and i practiced my walking as much as i could , and i went from the point of two people holding me up to one person holding me up to the point where i could walk around the furniture as long as it was n't too far apart .
the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us .
so we 've got to figure out how they 're living their lives .
they were constantly short of cash .
they were constantly searching for cash .
we are able to see which are the urban scenes that make people happy .
well , if you think that adventure is dangerous , try routine . it 's deadly .
let me introduce you to something i 've been working on .
it was science fiction made true , robotic engineering in a pre-electronic age , machines far in advance of anything that victorian technology could create , a machine we would later know as the robot .
they were illusions , a clever combination of mechanical engineering and the deceptiveness of the conjurer 's art .
mt : which is why humans and robots find it difficult to work in close proximity .
technology can do the same .
i 'd like to reimagine education .
many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world , in the millions , for free .
now , 155,000 is a big number .
but our kids are really different .
in fact , i believe — and i have two fat thumbs , i ca n't text very well — but i 'm willing to bet that with evolution , our kids and their grandchildren will develop really , really little , itty-bitty thumbs to text much better , that evolution will fix all of that stuff .
and the only way we discovered this was they wrote a blog and we happened to stumble upon that blog .
i was n't all that smart , and i would be scrambling , taking notes , and then i would lose the lecture for the rest of the hour .
so with instant feedback , students can try to apply answers .
how do you teach creativity ? how do you teach design ?
fifth is peer learning .
when we did our circuits course for the 155,000 students , i did n't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course .
i would like us to really reimagine education .
otherwise , how else do we tell our grandchildren that your grandparents sat in that room in neat little rows like cornstalks and watched this professor at the end talk about content and , you know , you did n't even have a rewind button ?
but it 's applicable , again , to every organ system .
again , if you 're squeamish , you do n't want to watch .
clearly the images kind of get that across .
to me , words are more like instincts and language .
doctor : how many are these ?
patient : a square and a circle .
but i also know that he was ; for all of us — you , me , the subject of his book , age more or less in step , proceed from birth along the same great sequence : through the wonders and confinements of childhood ; the emancipations and frustrations of adolescence ; the empowerments and millstones of adulthood ; the recognitions and resignations of old age .
and indeed , when i shared the list with my grandfather , he nodded in recognition .
`` `` give me liberty or give me death . '' ''
in the united states over the past hundred years , incomes have increased 30 times , and hundreds of thousands of people have been moved out of poverty .
and they have also decided to prioritize economic rights over political rights .
thirdly , people in the emerging markets look at china 's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout .
in a recent study , the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last .
the evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing .
the question that is left for us in general is , what then should the west be doing ?
and i suggest that they have two options .
the other option is for the west to cooperate , and by cooperating i mean giving the emerging market countries the flexibility to figure out in an organic way what political and economic system works best for them .
now i 'm sure some of you in the room will be thinking , well , this is like ceding to china , and this is a way , in other words , for the west to take a back seat .
the fact of the matter is that instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with china , the west should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions .
and instead of shoehorning democracy around the world , perhaps the west should take a leaf out of its own history book and remember that it takes a lot of patience in order to develop the models and the systems that you have today .
in fact , there are groups who would argue that they still do not have equal rights under the law .
awww . ( laughter ) i was born and raised in zambia in 1969 .
i bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years , i 've gone from not being recognized as a human being to standing in front of the illustrious ted crowd today to talk to you about my views .
pm : gabby , what did make you want to marry mark ?
actually , you did n't even live together .
`` you 've got to find a replacement for me . '' '' so i did n't actually resign from being an astronaut , but i gave up my job and they found a replacement . ''
gg : the debt ceiling . the debt ceiling .
get involved with your community .
it actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis .
there are three principles on which human life flourishes , and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure .
the role of a teacher is to facilitate learning .
i mean , you may have a dog .
they may find it boring .
they 're very personalized .
seven inches of rain fell over a very short period .
anyone in the room thought about sex today ?
( laughter ) yeah , you did .
now , when humans think about sex , male and female forms are generally what come to mind , but for many millions of years , such specific categories did n't even exist .
it leaves the [ body of the male ] , finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water , attaches itself to her body and deposits the sperm .
for many decades , biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether .
and it uses this dexterity to bypass the vagina altogether and deposit sperm directly into the female 's uterus , not to mention it 's a pretty good size .
we have to think about function as well , and when it comes to sex , function relates to the contributions made by the gametes , or the sperm and the eggs .
this is bedbug sex , and it 's aptly termed traumatic insemination .
a little guppy porn for you right there .
now unfortunately , in the animal kingdom , it 's the coercion strategy that we see time and time again .
it 's simply not going to happen unless the female is on board with the action .
so what are my take-home messages from my talk today ?
i mean who would put themselves through that ?
and we need that knowledge .
i wish this were different . we really need it now .
and on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid .
they use mobutu as metaphor .
even more problematic , they 're not listening to poor people themselves .
after 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation , it 's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people .
it 's money that 's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare , water , housing , alternative energy , thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity , but as individual customers , consumers , clients , people who want to make decisions in their own lives .
now , entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons .
and so many low-income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time , takes a lot of patience .
and he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether , despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in india make under a dollar a day .
it was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant .
and so we needed grants . and he used significant grants to research , to experiment , to fail , to innovate and try again .
they 've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances , and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in india .
and tasneem siddiqui , who developed a way called incremental housing , where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe , affordable community housing .
that there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall .
and he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he had n't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day .
`` and he said , `` '' of course i will . ''
because that is where dignity really starts .
i know it works .
after all , you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end , and the end depends on the reasoner 's passions .
you need two conditions : the first is that reasoners all care about their own well-being .
we all care passionately about our own well-being .
but all on its own , it 's a feeble instrument for making moral progress .
for one thing , it 's innately biased toward blood relations , babies and warm , fuzzy animals .
they demonstrated that the way people treated some particular group of others was logically inconsistent with the way they insisted on being treated themselves .
one man 's safety is owing to the destruction of another .
whatever is unfortunate in war , is severely so indeed , and whatever , on the contrary , is called good fortune , is a savage and a cruel good fortune , an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another 's woe .
on the contrary , it produces pleasure .
rng : the appeal to religion to justify the otherwise unjustifiable , such as the ban on contraception .
i 'm an introvert .
i 'm a wannabe fitness fanatic .
my relationship with god — it was not love at first sight .
what was this ?
i get it that people were angry at the terrorists .
hw : thank you so much . dalia mogahed .
it is , by far and away , the largest print library in the world .
in india , they 've got another couple bookmobiles running around .
and actually , it turns out to , you know , pay a living wage .
and the changes associated with that are changing the very nature of every aspect of governance and life on the planet in ways that our leaders ought to be thinking about , when they 're thinking about these immediate threats .
and an ipad .
and the weapon was the ipad .
we are seeing these changes everywhere we look .
we are seeing the advent of mobile money .
these are fundamental issues . where are the philosophers ?
`` they just thought , `` '' well , we 'll give a course of 10 . ''
this is actually very powerful .
they live in me somehow , their memories giving me meaning every day .
i did n't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little .
footsteps , confusion , people running .
he was young , he was shy .
every life matters , or every life should matter .
you 've heard about that concept : responsibility to protect .
i also know that i 'm very lucky compared to other hostages .
until quite recently , we simply did n't know how many brazilians were killed by guns .
what i 've learned over the last years is that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change .
again , this is no mere hypothetical .
we created public education .
we created public health care .
now , i love penguin documentaries , but that was n't the news of the day .
now , i believe so .
`` `` '' five minutes , '' '' he said . five minutes . ''
today 's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base that can see them through the challenges .
`` but then i stopped because i figured , `` '' hey , i 'm good enough . ''
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you ca n't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk .
and it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
and shortly thereafter , on january 19th , they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions .
all parties , all factions in society , backed this .
on february 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one .
the other place that 's very interested in city building is singapore .
they 're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in , and also an external legal system .
around the world , there 's 700 million people who say they 'd like to move permanently someplace else right now .
this is the boat we were on , by the way .
it 's still working its way up the food chain .
but even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed — the carelessness , the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean-up .
then , it is years of deadly damage control , frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter-insurgencies , and once again , no exit strategy .
`` can we put this off till 2020 , 2030 , 2050 ? '' '' or we ask , `` '' how much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive ? ''
another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris .
and greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness .
now i 'm not going to belabor this point , but studies do show that , as investors , women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men , precisely because , as we 've already heard , women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do .
we slapped mother nature around and won , and we always win , because dominating nature is our destiny .
they were just beyond our sights .
i believe that we know this , yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop .
`` now on the one hand , exhorting us to `` '' drill , baby , drill , '' '' because god put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them , and on the other , glorying in the wilderness of alaska 's untouched beauty on her hit reality tv show . ''
ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall .
now , would that this were just about sarah palin and her reality tv show .
so this is where the tar sands live , under one of the last magnificent boreal forests .
the process requires a huge amount of water , which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds .
but the truth is that , on average , turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in canada .
how else to describe this , but as a form of mass insanity ?
this is where our story of endless growth has taken us , to this black hole at the center of my country — a place of such planetary pain that , like the bp gusher , one can only stand to look at it for so long .
at the very last minute , we are going to get saved just like in every hollywood movie , just like in the rapture .
nevertheless , the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles , particularly media circles , with a relief tinged with euphoria .
we need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks — risks that confront recklessness head on , that put the precautionary principle into practice , even if that means through direct action — like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested , blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining . we need stories
there is no escape hatch .
first , let me introduce my husband , raoul .
he asked if i would be willing to help them isolate this gene .
kenong spent 10 years looking for this gene .
i 'm going to give you three examples .
but now , look at this papaya .
there 's no organic method . there 's no conventional method .
let 's look at the evidence .
one , complexity and unintended consequence .
it 's different in the less developed world .
maharaja : nothing to worry about , not a thing .
`` [ `` '' cg destruction '' '' ] [ `` '' 'lord of the rings : the return of the king ' ( 2003 ) '' '' ] [ `` '' massive software - crowd generation '' '' ] [ `` '' academy award winner for visual effects '' '' ] [ `` '' 'ben hur : a tale of the christ ' ( 1925 ) '' '' ] [ `` '' miniatures and puppets bring the crowd to life '' '' ] [ `` '' 'gladiator ' ( 2000 ) '' '' ] [ `` '' cg coliseum and digital crowds '' '' ] [ `` '' academy award winner for visual effects '' '' ] [ `` '' 'harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 ' ( 2011 ) '' '' ] [ `` '' academy award nominee for visual effects '' '' ] [ `` '' produced in conjunction with the academy 's science and technology council .

can we , as adults , grow new nerve cells ?
first , we know that they 're important for learning and memory .
thank you .
sheryl shade : hi , aimee . aimee mullins : hi .
ss : so , then aimee makes it to the 1996 paralympics , and she 's all excited . her family 's coming down — it 's a big deal .
and we 're at the trainee warm-up track , which is a few blocks away from the olympic stadium .
that 's another leg i have for , like , tennis and softball .
am : in these ?

they 're also silicon .
it 's like a barbie foot under this .
ss : that 's aimee mullins .
( applause )
ms : ... meaning not so optimistic .
there are some drug treatments , but they 're only effective on a small fraction of the population . and so , for the vast majority of patients , their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices .
so it consists of two parts , what we call an encoder and a transducer .
now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output , and what the implications of this are .
so what about with our approach , adding the code ? and you can see that it 's much better . not only can you tell that it 's a baby 's face , but you can tell that it 's this baby 's face , which is a really challenging task .
we are fighting against this .
before we started , there were , as usual , more than 80 percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases .
and boys , about 30 percent .
in the 18th century , it became a verb , and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone .
`` and unfortunately , the press tends to reinforce this norm when they 're reporting on a doodling scene — of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like — they typically use words like `` '' discovered '' '' or `` '' caught '' '' or `` '' found out , '' '' as if there 's some sort of criminal act being committed . ''
now it turned out to be bill gates ' doodle .
so here 's a new definition for doodling .
in other words , they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order .
so over the past year , our work on machine perception has also unexpectedly connected with the world of machine creativity and machine art .
you multiply two times three and you 're done .
how would we ever learn such a model ?
in other words , if we 've solved for w the right way , then the error will be zero .
so remember that what 's been going on here is that we 've been taking a lot of known x 's and known y 's and solving for the w in the middle through an iterative process .
here he and alex together have tried reducing the y 's to a space of only two dimensions , thereby making a map out of the space of all things recognized by this network .
that 's what this little demonstration is .
the number of beavers started to increase , because beavers like to eat the trees .
ravens and bald eagles came down to feed on the carrion that the wolves had left .
it lets nature decide , and nature , by and large , is pretty good at deciding .
the other one is the rewilding of human life .
why is it that they can withstand the loss of so much of their bark ?
why should n't all of us have a serengeti on our doorsteps ?
i think of it as sort of a cathedral .
giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
`` without hesitation , little dorothy responded , `` yes , daddy , and fish swim backwards by wagging their heads . '' ''
we fear the worst .
yeah . they 're all true .
it 's immediate and passive .
seeing is believing . sight is truth .
objects appeared , morphed and disappeared in my reality .
i pieced together fragmented , transitory images , consciously analyzed the clues , searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope , until i saw nothing at all .
that 's compared to approximately eight percent for touch and two to three percent for hearing .
when you face a compelling opportunity to take action , fear lulls you into inaction , enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves .
blindness was a death sentence for my independence .
it was the end of achievement for me .
it can be taught . it can be practiced .
choose to see through them .
i urge you to search them out .
and this willingness to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity , which is naturally rewarding .
seven to one is the ratio , they tend to say .
and our next dog speaks in something called the revenant , which means a spirit that comes back to visit you .
his name was mcdow , major mcdow .
that morning , we left at about 5 a.m .
she kind of looked at them . no one said anything .
i have master 's , ph.d. , undergrad , one in medical school .
how do i keep them safe ? how do i keep them alive ?
i love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in los angeles , aziza hasan and malka fenyvesi .
he 's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13 , in a car crash that killed his father and his sister .
we spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive , and i spend a lot of time being those things too .
and at the same time that we are doing that , i think we are rediscovering the power of story — that as human beings , we need stories to survive , to flourish , to change .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us .
this is going to change science , i believe , and it will change religion .
he liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages .
`` and when i look at the second , i ask , what kind of person was he ? what kind of man is this ? '' '' well , he was complicated . ''
but compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious .
we know now that that is not the case because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces .
and these arguments are getting stronger , not weaker , with time .
this was not done in isolation .
but here — here 's the intriguing part .
we know how to fix hunger .
`` it says `` '' bon appetit '' '' in arabic . ''
actually , i love sports and i can play many sports , like swimming , skiing , skating , scuba diving , running and so on .
and this is gdp per capita on this axis .
and i want to look at sweden and the united states .
but why were confident to leave that day ?
( applause )
these laws treat people touched by hiv with compassion and acceptance .
and the trend ? well the trend is clear .
but changing the law is n't .
we were making what was invisible visible .
i 've been doing this for 30 years .
i 've been part of a social movement that has been working on ending violence against women and children .
i was probably 30 and naive .
he called it the take the fun out of marriage act .
i 'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here .
woman : well , i thought you 'd be home a couple hours ago , and i put everything away , so— man : what is this ? pizza . woman : if you had just called me , i would have known— man : dinner ? dinner ready is a pizza ? woman : honey , please do n't be so loud .
man : you want to see what hurts ? ( slaps woman ) that 's what hurts ! that 's what hurts ! ( breaking glass ) woman : help me !
movements are about moments , and we seized this moment .
so , step four : we needed to engage men .
and i already told you i 'm a data nerd .
`` they talk to their kids as parents , as coaches . '' '' and that 's what we did . ''
`` he gave her this big hug , and he said , `` '' people ask me why i do this work . ''
we 've got to do a better job for our kids .
but i did n't know how .
his name was john j. bonica .
it was a summer day in 1941 .
after that , he hit the books .
he wrote what would later be known as the bible of pain .
hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world .
but as they did — a tragic twist .
`` `` '' if i was n't as busy as i am , '' '' he told a reporter at the time , `` i would be a completely disabled guy . '' ''
but still , i love imagining it .
he felt it . he lived it .
sometimes i get stuck seeing her that same way .
i gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise .
but what does that look like ?
we 've known how to cure malaria since the 1600s .
so we 've known how to cure malaria for centuries .
we 've known how to prevent malaria since 1897 .
i grew up as the daughter of indian immigrants visiting my cousins in india every summer , and because i had no immunity to the local malarias , i was made to sleep under this hot , sweaty mosquito net every night while my cousins , they were allowed to sleep out on the terrace and have this nice , cool night breeze wafting over them .
and i really hated the mosquitos for that .
and i think there 's three main reasons why .
it lives half its life inside the cold-blooded mosquito and half its life inside the warm-blooded human .
it 's a shape-shifter , for one thing .
so the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle , but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite .
so it 's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects .
we 've been able to take malaria out of a society .
but just if you take malaria out , deaths from everything else go down .
but along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge , there 's also a cultural challenge , and this is probably the part about malaria that people do n't like to talk about .
`` they ask people in malarious parts of the world , `` what do you think about malaria ? '' ''
when i told my relatives in india that i was writing a book about malaria , they kind of looked at me like i told them i was writing a book about warts or something .
they had so much faith in their tools that they stopped doing malaria research .
but now , i think , the dilemma is the cultural challenge .
we can do more education , we can try to convince these people to use the nets .
we 're throwing a lot more time and money into workshops and trainings and musicals and plays and school meetings , all these things to convince people to use the nets we gave you .
we attacked the malarious way of life , and by doing that , we slowly built malaria out .
i believe that the greatest failure of the human race is the fact that we 've left more than one billion of our members behind .
lever number one : most of the world 's poor are farmers .
when farmers become more productive , they earn more income , they climb out of poverty , they feed their communities and they reduce environmental land pressure .
farmers stand at the center of the world .
they then get their individual orders and walk it home to their farms .
look at the pride on her face .
that 's a remarkably small area overall .
if we are willing , every one of us has a role to play .
but we also need a lot of support roles .
we 've invented supercomputers that fit into our pockets and connect us with anybody on the planet .
and we really , we really loved this machine .
the empire is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?
well , that 's today , but we do n't even know what the jobs of the future are going to look like .
and he 's teaching her how to browse .
i started experimenting with other subjects , among them , for example , pronunciation .
i found a village . it was called kallikuppam in southern india .
they 'd got a zero . i gave them a test .
it took nature 100 million years to make the ape stand up and become homo sapiens .
but we have to integrate that into our own future .
when you 're standing in a trench all alone , if you could have survived , you 're okay , you 've passed .
but the age of empires is gone .
she does it with only one age-old gesture .
if you allow the educational process to self-organize , then learning emerges .
i think that 's what all this is pointing at .
sm : a decade ahead of her time .
you already heard about that . you know what that means .
first of all , we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism .
but also we 've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs .
my fundamental message to you is this : we can not continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological .
thank you .
dm : i 'm suggesting we have to be open-minded .
the chinese zodiac is different .
for example , if you were born in 1975 , you are a rabbit .
chinese people believe some animals are natural enemies .
raise your hand if you are a snake .
you may not realize this , but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy .
and i 'm not even talking about the american presidential race . ( laughter ) we have a high-profile journalist caught for plagiarism , a young superstar writer whose book involves so many made up quotes that they 've pulled it from the shelves ; a new york times exposé on fake book reviews .
does anybody know what he was looking for ?
let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions we 've been tracking and documenting .
`` my battery was dead . '' '' your battery was n't dead . ''
those are the conversations that really matter .
the phone , in contrast , the most lies .
you know , we always think that hey , there are these idealized versions , people are just showing the best things that happened in their lives . i 've thought that many times .
well , we were really interested in it , and so what we did is we brought people , online daters , into the lab , and then we measured them . we got their height up against the wall , we put them on a scale , got their weight — ladies loved that — and then we actually got their driver 's license to get their age .
and what we found was very , very interesting .
well it has to do with pinocchio 's nose .
the eyes do not tell us whether somebody 's lying or not .
now , as i said , as a social scientist , this is wonderful .
it 's transformational . we 're going to be able to learn so much more about human thought and expression , about everything from love to attitudes , because everything is being recorded now , but what does it mean for the average citizen ?
and i think we 're going to see a lot more of that , where we can reflect on who we are by looking at what we wrote , what we said , what we did .
not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine , but you 're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to , and you 're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms .
because in the digital age we live in now , in the networked age , we are all leaving a record .
i 've always written primarily about architecture , about buildings , and writing about architecture is based on certain assumptions .
`` and then he saw a squirrel running along the wire , and he said , `` '' there 's your problem . ''
and then they connect to the continent somewhere .
because once a country gets plugged in by one cable , they realize that it 's not enough . if they 're going to build an industry around it , they need to know that their connection is n't tenuous but permanent , because if a cable breaks , you have to send a ship out into the water , throw a grappling hook over the side , pick it up , find the other end , and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over .
but what amazes me is simon 's incredible geographic imagination .
it seemed like there was a moment when the continent was being plugged in , and i wanted to see that .
and simon was working on a new cable , wacs , the west africa cable system , that stretched from lisbon down the west coast of africa , to cote d'ivoire , to ghana , to nigeria , to cameroon .
and first they got it with a hacksaw , and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a — sort of working like chefs , and then finally they 're working like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down , and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together .
and when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw , you stop thinking about the internet as a cloud .
and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology , as much as this is an incredibly new thing , the physical process itself has been around for a long time , and the culture is the same .
and this is the world your children will live in .
and it goes down the sides and goes into the critter 's mouth .
and much of what i do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form .
everybody 's got one — all of you .
i can guarantee , everyone in this room , all of you over there , the people in the cushy seats , the people up top with the laptops — we all have bodies .
( laughter ) and so when i make these things , it 's really not so much about the object itself , but rather the negative space around the object .
and once again , it 's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug .
but there 's more than you can do with these magic boxes .
and this was an inspiration to me .
( applause )
actually you do n't .
this is a sculpture i made , which is a way of , kind of , freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom .
and the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction .
and then there was a second level to this object , which is that it — i wanted it to convey some proportions that i was interested in , which is the diameter of the moon and the diameter of the earth in proportion to each other .
i was exploring , really early on , wanting to make things float in the air .
so here is the earth . it 's a little less than a millimeter that was turned of solid bronze .
as you can see the little tether , that it 's also magnetically levitated .
this is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist .
it was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure .
primarily i would be interested in how it would interact with , say , going to a college campus , and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences , the world , the situation of the globe .
so there has been a lot of change .
but i say it has to be under the conditions i 've always worked : no credit , no logos , no sponsoring .
actually , that photo was pasted in a police station , and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police .
here they even got the help of the firemen .
but maybe we should change the question .
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
initially , all we did was autograph it .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
and it 's just standard selection : we can select for viability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
we 're focusing on now fourth-generation fuels .
it takes co2 to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
but also , we 're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
you 've seen this year with flu ; we 're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by building combinatorial vaccines in advance .
it 's one of the things that we do n't like to think about , but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true .
this guy is stopping , dead stop , dead stop on the highway .
it was just going 65 — to zero ?
but the technology exists now that can help us improve that .
in the future , with cars exchanging data with each other , we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind , to the right and left , all at the same time , bird 's eye view , we will actually be able to see into those cars .
it 's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions about where a car 's going to be in the near future .
if your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories , you do n't pay as much attention to those packets .
fundamentally , these technologies exist today .
i think it 's a very disconcerting notion , this idea that our cars will be watching us , talking about us to other cars , that we 'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip .
i call a name that could be his .
the crispr technology allows scientists to make changes to the dna in cells that could allow us to cure genetic disease .
the opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider , because this technology can be employed not only in adult cells , but also in the embryos of organisms , including our own species .
the reason we envisioned using the crispr system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken dna and repair it .
the technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell 's dna affect either a tissue or , in this case , an entire organism .
this raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider , and this is why i and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the crispr technology in human embryos , to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of doing so .
thank you .
jennifer doudna : my colleagues were actually , i think , delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this openly .
is there a possible split happening in the science community about this ?
and when we get access to them , we are blown away , we fall in love .
what might the connections be when we start exploring our heritage , the beautiful locations and the art in this world ?
you can obviously look at objects in the guggenheim museum , you can obviously get into them and so on and so forth .
there 's a lot of information here .
it certainly is not clever , and it 's not original .
but sometimes , habituation is n't good .
and then he 'd turn it the other way , and it was 100 degrees too cold .
when he opened the window , though , he let all this cold , wet air inside , making all the passengers miserable .
that was n't the case for me .
he called it staying beginners , and wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details to make them faster , easier and seamless for the new customers .
people understood them .
and we designed a special screw , a custom screw , much to the chagrin of our investors .
every day , i 'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids .
`` picasso once said , `` '' every child is an artist . ''
and because it 's a three-dimensional world , we can move a camera around inside that world .
lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world .
we use science to create something wonderful .
this guy , wall-e , is a great example of that .
we got so geeked-out on making wall-e this convincing robot , that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect .
in the next scene , wall-e comes back to life .
but it had become about using our brain without our eyes , the science without the art .
and then he started clapping .
but i know where she was .
hello .
what does it do ?
in this repair pathway , it takes a homologous piece of dna .
so , how cheap is it ?
this is n't going to be settled for years .
so , is it really cheap ?
there was a great story of some little girl who they saved from leukemia by taking the blood out , editing it , and putting it back with a precursor of crispr .
so : is it really easy ?
that would be kind of cool , right ?
but what is happening is that crispr is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists to do really , really important work , like making better models of diseases in animals , for example , or for taking pathways that produce valuable chemicals and getting them into industrial production in fermentation vats , or even doing really basic research on what genes do .
lots of scientists did a lot of work to make crispr happen , and what 's interesting to me is that these scientists are being supported by our society .
we all have a responsibility .
the only thing that they ca n't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel .
( laughter ) well , yeah .
unlike their creative brothers and sisters , who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians , fashion designers can sample from all their peers ' designs .
and that 's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration , so it 's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry .
now , the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry .
here 's what he had to say .
tom ford : and we found after much research that — actually not much research , quite simple research — that the counterfeit customer was not our customer .
he has complained a lot about people copying him , but in one interview i read , he said it has really forced him to up his game .
they 're trying to put together a signature look , an aesthetic that reflects who they are .
they knock themselves off .
a person can come in and take somebody else 's gown , cut off three inches from the bottom , go to the e.u . and register it as a new , original design .
so , that does not stop the knock-off artists .
but this has not stopped diane von furstenberg .
that is a very difficult question to answer .
you can not copyright a recipe because it 's a set of instructions , it 's fact , and you can not copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish .
or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea : something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it ?
it is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds .
i 'm with one . he 's my boyfriend , he 's okay .
and my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future .
abortion is common .
it 's political and polarizing .
there are two main ways to get started .
one way is to listen closely .
the catholic who is grateful for hers .
it 's not easy . it 's very hard .
it creates a culture and a society that values what make us special and unique .
and more to the point : with all of this creative talent , what more could we do ?
and what about the patients ' experience ?
i have learned that architecture can be a transformative engine for change .
about a year ago , i read an article about a tireless and intrepid civil rights leader named bryan stevenson .
the act of collecting soil itself has lead to a type of spiritual healing .
we live in a galaxy , the milky way galaxy .
every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our milky way — a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs .
( laughter ) which tells you something about our place in the universe .
but we would also like to understand it .
because if there had been , they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole .
keeping the universe very , very smooth at early times is not easy ; it 's a delicate arrangement .
we would like to know what .
we 'd like to understand that .
`` he gave the popular lectures that became `` '' the character of physical law . '' '' he gave lectures to caltech undergrads that became `` '' the feynman lectures on physics . '' '' he gave lectures to caltech graduate students that became `` '' the feynman lectures on gravitation . '' '' in every one of these books , every one of these sets of lectures , he emphasized this puzzle : why did the early universe have such a small entropy ? ''
if you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be moving away faster .
it is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other .
for one thing , the universe will expand forever .
but if there 's dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever .
there 's a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon .
he thought that space and time were explained by isaac newton — they were absolute ; they just stuck there forever .
well if that 's true , boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern-sounding ideas — the multiverse and the anthropic principle .
that universe will last 10 to the 100 years — a lot longer than our little universe has lived .
that empty space lasts essentially forever .
so here 's two questions for you .
you could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness .
so like i said , i do n't actually know the answer .
i 'm going to give you my favorite scenario .
or maybe the big bang is not the beginning of the universe .
maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken .
if that 's true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bigger multiverse .
what is creativity ?
i want to talk about what we learn from conservatives .
they hold potluck dinners .
indeed , they sell books about potluck dinners .
indeed , they , like all of us , celebrate this kind of relationship .
so here 's exhibit number one .
js : there 's obviously also something really deeply great about this .
the creator does n't have any rights .
it is outrageous .
we need to speak of those values .
they went out into the field to answer a particular question .
is there life beyond earth in our solar system ?
mars — dry and arid .
and so about 15 years ago , we started a series of missions to go to mars and see if water existed on mars in its past that changed its geology .
curiosity has also drilled in that red soil and brought up other material .
these craters are weeping during the summer .
oceanographers were completely surprised .
well , we believe because it has water and has had it for a significant period of time , and we believe it has hydrothermal vents with perhaps the right organic material , it is a place where life could exist .
titan is a huge moon of saturn .
it perhaps is much larger than the planet mercury .
and on the surface , cassini has found liquid .
actually almost the size of our black sea in some places .
and this area is not liquid water ; it 's methane .
all right , so let 's take four subjects that obviously go together : big data , tattoos , immortality and the greeks .
now , the issue about tattoos is that , without a word , tattoos really do shout .
what if you 're only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes ? ( laughter ) well , then , because of electronic tattoos , maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality , because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will .
if you lost , you died .
and that , of course , is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos .
( applause )
and that 's actually what i 'd like to talk about today .
we lived in ethiopia for a month , working at an orphanage .
the right to live like a human .
and what we 're facing in africa is an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality .
this is about justice . really .
look at the response to the tsunami — it 's inspiring .
because there is no way we can look at what 's happening in africa , and if we 're honest , conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else .
our values : do we have any ?
actually , i come from punk rock .
there are moments in history when civilization redefines itself .
the ones that ted has offered to grant .
you ca n't take anything for granted .
`` travel , for me , is a little bit like being in love , because suddenly all your senses are at the setting marked `` '' on . '' '' suddenly you 're alert to the secret patterns of the world . ''
certainly when i 'm traveling , especially to the major cities of the world , the typical person i meet today will be , let 's say , a half-korean , half-german young woman living in paris .
they move to new york city .
all around me were 800 acres of wild dry brush .
we just put a blind person in it and we 're done , right ?
so it measures acceleration , angular acceleration — like a human ear , inner ear .
the lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles — a car approaching from the front , the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads , any obstacles around the vehicle .
but the problem is this : how do we convey this information and instructions to a person who can not see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive ?
so these are a pair of gloves , and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer — the direction and the intensity .
so this is a chair — as a matter of fact , it 's actually a massage chair .
so this is not really freedom , right ?
the computer tells you how to drive — turn left , turn right , speed up , stop .
so here you can see the left camera , the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the airpix .
for this , we 're showing a simulator , a blind person driving using the airpix .
so just a month ago , on january 29th , we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public at the world-famous daytona international speedway during the rolex 24 racing event .
( applause ) dh : so since we started this project , we 've been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
and it 's really a conflux of urban population rising , biodiversity plummeting and also , of course , sea levels rising and climate changing .
we need new tools and new approaches .
it can grow ; you can grow it ; and — did i mention ? — it 's quite tasty .
and what 's circled is the site that i 'm going to talk about , the gowanus canal and governors island .
and here 's a map of that condition , showing the contaminants in yellow and green , exacerbated by this new flow of storm-surge and sea-level rise .
and you can see from this map , there 's this incredible geographical signature of a series of islands that were out in the harbor and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches that served as natural wave attenuation for the upland settlement .
so the project really addresses these three core issues in a new and exciting way , i think .
this image is an image of an oyster cart , which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today .
( laughter ) finally , oysters can attenuate and agglomerate onto each other and form these amazing natural reef structures .
so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project .
you can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space .
it also creates this incredibly interesting , i think , new amphibious public space , where you can imagine working , you can imagine recreating in a new way .
you can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them .
and also showing oyster gardening for the community along its edges .
and the second one is : when can we eat the oysters ?
now , i popped some pills earlier .
it 's the bottom line , the dollar line .
on the dig , surrounded by emerald green rice paddies , i discovered an intact pot .
i did n't know where i was .
never are we so present as when we are in the midst of the great past .
good science , imagination and a leap of faith are the trifecta we use to raise the dead .
that 's 10 inches .
( applause ) i believe we have barely scratched the surface in terms of what 's left to discover .
but we have a challenge .
they 've destroyed the tomb of jonah .
sometimes when you travel , you end up finding long-lost family — not those with whom you share genes , but a shared entry in the book of life .
( arabic ) omer by brother , i will always love you .
and off to the side are always going to be rich examples of exactly what you 're seeing , to help guide you .
what is it that we find so sexy in math ?
it is about imagination , the talent which we most praise .
who do you want to interview first ?
not so clear .
around 4 a.m. , i go to bed in low spirits .
`` as in this cryptic sentence i found in the guardian recently : `` '' the marriage suffered a setback in 1965 , when the husband was killed by the wife . '' '' ( laughter ) there 's a world of invisibility there , is n't there ? ( laughter ) ''
with matter , as with people , we see only the skin of things .
so , one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we ca n't see we also ca n't understand .
but we can touch each other , taste each other perhaps , if we get close enough .
but we ca n't read each other 's minds . i find that quite astonishing .
i refuse to be drawn on the question of whether god exists , until somebody properly defines the terms .
i do n't know if you know this . modern physics , there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time does n't really exist , because it 's too inconvenient for the figures .
`` one of the interesting things about the past is you particularly ca n't see . my son asked me this the other day , he said , `` '' dad , can you remember what i was like when i was two ? '' '' and i said , `` '' yes . '' '' and he said , `` '' why ca n't i ? '' '' is n't that extraordinary ? you can not remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three , which is great news for psychoanalysts , because otherwise they 'd be out of a job . ''
what are we ? what is this thing that we hang on , that is actually us ?
they do n't . nobody knows what it is .
heinrich hertz , when he discovered radio waves in 1887 , he called them radio waves because they radiated .
and to help you , i 've got two things to leave you with , from two great philosophers , perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century , one a mathematician and an engineer , and the other a poet .
`` the first is ludwig wittgenstein who said , `` '' i do n't know why we are here . ''
this is the machine below geneva .
this was the result .
we designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes .
there was no responsibility .
so i took to my bed for about a month , and when i woke up i found i was institutionalized , and when i saw the other inmates , i realized that i had found my people , my tribe . ( laughter ) because they became my only friends , they became my friends , because very few people that i knew — well , i was n't sent a lot of cards or flowers . i mean , if i had had a broken leg or i was with child i would have been inundated , but all i got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up .
`` because i did n't think of that . ( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) because , you know , the one thing , one thing that you get with this disease , this one comes with a package , is you get a real sense of shame , because your friends go , `` '' oh come on , show me the lump , show me the x-rays , '' '' and of course you 've got nothing to show , so you 're , like , really disgusted with yourself because you 're thinking , `` i 'm not being carpet-bombed . i do n't live in a township . '' ''
when we were ancient man — ( laughter ) — millions of years ago , and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator , okay ? — ( laughter ) — we would — thank you . i drew these myself . ( laughter ) thank you very much . thank you . thank you . ( applause ) thank you . anyway , we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol , and then we 'd kill or be killed , we 'd eat or we 'd be eaten , and then suddenly we 'd de-fuel , and we 'd go back to normal . okay .
look at these two highly distinguished gentlemen : we have kanzi — he 's mastered 200 lexical tokens , an incredible feat .
artificial intelligence used to be about putting commands in a box .
a biological neuron fires , maybe , at 200 hertz , 200 times a second .
there are also size limitations , like a human brain has to fit inside a cranium , but a computer can be the size of a warehouse or larger .
now , a superintelligence with such technological maturity would be extremely powerful , and at least in some scenarios , it would be able to get what it wants .
a superintelligence is a really strong optimization process .
this is a lesson that 's also taught in many a myth .
but so could a superintelligent agent , and it would be much better at that than we are .
i believe that with a social pan-africanist thinking and using the internet as a tool , we can begin to rescue each other , and ultimately , to rescue ourselves .
if you put too much cold water in , it will shatter .
but one of the more wonky things about me is that i am an animal behaviorist , and i use those skills not to study animal behavior but to study how people in cities use city public spaces .
people would come in , find their own seat , move it a bit , actually , and then stay a while , and then interestingly , people themselves attracted other people , and ironically , i felt more peaceful if there were other people around .
but architects love them .
they might tolerate a sculpture or two , but that 's about it .
how were we going to find housing for that many new new yorkers ?
it 's not something you can just fake .
so in the areas where we zoned for significant development , i was determined to create places that would make a difference in people 's lives .
here you see what was two miles of abandoned , degraded waterfront in the neighborhoods of greenpoint and williamsburg in brooklyn , impossible to get to and impossible to use .
honestly , i had no idea how it would turn out .
and then it opened , and i have to tell you , it was incredible .
but i thought if we went to the lower manhattan development corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower manhattan .
how do you turn a park into a place that people want to be ?
where broadway traffic used to run , there are now tables and chairs .
`` you might say , `` '' how wonderful it is that more than four million people come from all over the world to visit the high line . '' '' well , a developer sees just one thing : customers . ''
if there is any one lesson that i have learned in my life as a city planner , it is that public spaces have power .
people stay because they are having a great time .
thank you .
it was a beautiful day .
the forest was sparkling .
the campers who were too lazy to take out what they had brought in , who did they think would clean up after them ?
according to the bureau of labor statistics , sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country , and i learned why .
we use them , we throw them out , we forget about them , because we know there 's a workforce on the other side that 's going to take it all away .
and their work lets us do our work .
and i tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days , but i started to cry .
just imagine wembley stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees .
`` a human can say , `` '' look , there is a god above the clouds ! ''
yet , what is money ?
now , we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people .
now fast forward to 1900 : half the world 's people — more than half — still live in asia , but they 're now making only a fifth of the world 's product .
what happened ? the industrial revolution , which meant that all of a sudden , europe and america became the dominant center of the world .
now when the price of any technology declines that dramatically , the barriers to entry go down .
some of it 's bad : al qaeda , another non-governmental actor .
now the problem is that we 're not thinking about it in very innovative ways .
and that ability to get others to want what you want , to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment , is what i call soft power .
for example , the great oxford historian who taught here at this university , a.j.p . taylor , defined a great power as a country able to prevail in war .
in the 1980s , as america went through a transition in the reagan period , between the rust belt economy of the midwest to the silicon valley economy of california , that was the end of america .
so we 've got , what , 17 more years to go or so before china 's bigger .
does n't tell you much about military power , does n't tell you very much about soft power .
is this just a game that diplomats and academics play ?
and as i said earlier , china has not passed the united states .
if china develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with its problems of carbon emissions , that 's good for us as well as good for china as well as good for everybody else .
so empowering china to deal with its own problems of carbon is good for everybody , and it 's not a zero sum , i win , you lose .
it 's one in which we can all gain .
all this still persists .
just like many of them , i was completely apolitical until 2009 .
in june 2010 , internet changed my life forever .
`` i thought , `` '' i could be khaled . '' '' i could not sleep that night , and i decided to do something . ''
the 25th of january is police day .
it helped a decentralized movement arise .
at the time , they did n't even understand it .
and three days later , mubarak was forced to step down .
it was a moment of defeat .
and also , make it socially acceptable that we change our minds , or probably even reward that ?
so , i am a jungian psychoanalyst , and i went to afghanistan in january 2004 , by chance , on an assignment for medica mondiale .
you may know this from the media , but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is 17 years old , which means they grow up in such an environment and — i repeat myself — in 30 years of war .
yet , there is hope .
and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context .
to compensate this loss of inner control , they try to control the outside , very understandably — mostly the family — and unfortunately , this fits very well into the traditional side , regressive side , repressive side , restrictive side of the cultural context .
so everybody needs a sense for the future , and the afghan sense of the future is shattered .
`` so everybody must be able to say , `` '' this happened to me , and it did this with me , but i 'm able to live with it , to cope with it , and to learn from it . ''
this was our sign — it 's hand-painted , and we had 45 all over kabul .
but for that , we already have the training manuals , which are approved by the ministry and moreover , this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan .
and here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression , moderate and severe .
and the red line is the treatment as usual — medication with a medical doctor .
and i realized something interesting : avaz helps children with autism learn words .
it 's also the way in which these words are arranged , the way these words are modified and arranged .
so there is another hidden abstraction here which children with autism find a lot of difficulty coping with , and that 's the fact that you can modify words and you can arrange them to have different meanings , to convey different ideas .
it 's the way in which you can put things together in order to convey anything you want to .
you want to eat ? somebody else wants to eat ?
so i was very excited by this , you know , hopping around all over the place , trying to figure out if i can convert all possible sentences that i hear into this .
`` you do that by changing the word `` '' want . '' '' again , if you wanted to say , `` i wanted soup yesterday , '' you do that by converting the word `` '' want '' '' into `` '' wanted . '' '' it 's a past tense . ''
so , who told ? i told .
so who could n't pay ? i could n't pay .
first of all , i could have started anywhere .
`` i did n't have to start with the word `` '' tell . '' '' i could have started anywhere in the sentence , and i could have made this entire thing . ''
the second thing is , if i was n't an english speaker , if i was speaking in some other language , this map would actually hold true in any language .
and so i developed this thing .
is it possible to use freespeech not for children with autism but to teach language to people without disabilities ?
and i built an app out of it , a game out of it , in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement , a sound reinforcement of visual structures , they 're able to learn language .
so this is the freespeech ecosystem .
that 's a pretty interesting concept in itself .
this is a photograph of my collaborators , my earliest collaborators when i started working on language and autism and various other things .
she has quadriplegic cerebral palsy , so ever since she was born , she could neither move nor talk .
and i 'm being told the dynamic .
because of course , the ear is , i mean , subject to all sorts of things .
give power to designers .
about a dozen officers then gathered near us .
`` i never expected to be described by my own government in these terms : `` lurking , '' `` nefarious , '' `` terrorist . '' ''
they sent dogs trained to smell explosives to sweep the area i 'd been in .
and i know when i say ferguson , many of you will think of police violence .
and if you could — if you could call a family member who could somehow come up with some money , then maybe you were out .
just imagine spending from right now until sometime in june in the place that i described to you a few moments ago .
and he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond , and when they came , the man was unconscious .
and so , i heard all these stories about this grotesque dungeon that ferguson was operating for its debtors , and when it came time for me to actually see it and to go visit ferguson 's jail , i 'm not sure what i was expecting to see , but i was n't expecting this .
it could be a post office or a school .
what i have in mind is our policy of bail .
and so from inside , it does n't look very complicated , right ?
what is it made of ?
i could n't speak english , and i was way behind in terms of reading and writing .
now imagine that women are represented here , and men are represented here .
within that first week , at least one man in every single country in the world stood up to be counted , and within that same week , heforshe created more than 1.2 billion conversations on social media .
madam , it has been two weeks , and the woman has not cried since .
heforshe is about uplifting all of us together .
`` i said , `` '' nick , this is very cool . ''
and the creator very considerately offered a replay for her mom .
and it 's similar with new technologies .
you look online , you 'll see places like codecademy and events like coderdojo and sites like girls who code , or black girls code .
`` after you 've created your program , you can click on `` '' share , '' '' and then share your project with other people , so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well . ''
here 's an example from hong kong , where some kids made a game and then built their own physical interface device and had a light sensor , so the light sensor detects the hole in the board , so as they move the physical saw , the light sensor detects the hole and controls the virtual saw on the screen and saws down the tree .
this is an example from a new version of scratch that we 'll be releasing in the next few months , and we 're looking again to be able to push you in new directions .
again , it 's useful to make an analogy to reading and writing .
now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious .
and it 's in fact working .
they 're relevant for all sorts of different activities .
now , who knows if victor is going to grow up and become a programmer or a professional computer scientist ?
regardless of whether he grows up to be a marketing manager or a mechanic or a community organizer , that these ideas are useful for everybody .
very few people become professional writers .
again , the same thing with coding .
but working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity and developing new ways of expressing herself .
this was — this is south of the antarctic circle .
and it been growing for about 600 years .
now , these beliefs did not come naturally to me , because trusting big institutions , not really part of my family legacy .
ok. do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout instead of the miso-glazed chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have ?
`` `` this one cup may inspire others to use one too . '' ''
do you remember the grimm 's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot ?
we believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command : make more money .
71 percent wanted that .
so is it true ?
well , you know , the investors in companies like burt 's bees or ben & jerry 's would n't say so .
but maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule , right ?
so , harvard business school actually researched this , and they found something fascinating .
almost twice as much sweet porridge .
passionate clarity : that 's what i think we need to drive change .
passion about the change we want to see in the world , and clarity that we are able to help chart the course .
thank you .
this very whale right here could be over 250 years old .
tommy mizzone : tonight we 're going to play you two songs .
and on guitar is my 14-year-old brother , tommy .
i know , i know .
we 're postmodern , we 're post-structural , we 're post-feminist .
first : the past .
time has a history , and so do black people .
we black people have always been out of time .
so in manghetu sculpture , you 'd see this recursive geometry .
but that was n't always me .
we pretended . we all became smart cowards .
where i used to stand up alone seven years ago , now i belong to a community of many people who stand up with me .
do you know why you were born ?
thank you .
we 're very hungry for fossil fuels too .
half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away .
and in fact , that 's true of every ancient city .
well i think it looks a bit like this .
`` it 's like after every exam , when i walk out , the teacher would say , `` '' hey , come . ''
so the lamp is not just giving a light , it 's also giving a darkness .
so all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses .
yes , you can , and i 'll show you in a second how to do that .
marco tempest : now tesla 's brain worked in the most extraordinary way .
nt : to my delight , i discovered i could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility .
nt : we are at the dawn of a new age , the age of electricity .
nt : i had bigger ideas .
his legacy is with us still .
thank you .
this room we left open .
so that 's the blueprint of the house .
that was a bit more inspiring .
i became very low .
it is such a privilege to go to antarctica , i ca n't tell you .
i grew up in wonder .
he was bringing peace to a divided and violent south africa , one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity .
`` through this act of immense open-heartedness , he was to become the embodiment of what in south africa we call `` '' ubuntu . '' '' ubuntu : i am because of you . ''
you are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who i am .
now , i can tell you , i do n't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle , but it makes for über-resourcefulness .
it was a hot day , and we found ourselves down by the river .
and a few meters ahead of us , there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank , and its branches were touching the water , and it was shadowy .
it pulls me . it turns . i throw my hand up . i 'm able to grab a branch .
he picks me and puts me on his shoulder .
she was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis .
it looked like an inverted bracket , and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow , and then we would come around the corner , and there she would be with her herd .
she got visibly — ears came forward , she had a full go of it and halfway up , her legs gave way , and she fell backwards .
and it occurred to me that the rest of the herd was in fact looking after this young elephant .
and while it 's true that ubuntu is an african idea , what i see is the essence of that value being invented here .
thank you .
and everything , they used to call it madiba magic .
( applause )
why ca n't an equivalent case be made for nature ?
but it 's not that straightforward .
we then have gone on since to present for [ the ] international community , for governments , for local governments and for business and for people , for you and me , a whole slew of reports , which were presented at the u.n. last year , which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it .
this rainfall cycle , this rainfall factory , effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of 240 billion dollars-worth in latin america .
but the question arises : okay , so how much do uruguay , paraguay , argentina and indeed the state of mato grosso in brazil pay for that vital input to that economy to the state of amazonas , which produces that rainfall ?
at the species level , it 's been estimated that insect-based pollination , bees pollinating fruit and so on , is something like 190 billion dollars-worth .
we did estimates in our study that for countries like brazil , india and indonesia , even though ecosystem services — these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free — they 're not very big in percentage terms of gdp — two , four , eight , 10 , 15 percent — but in these countries , if we measure how much they 're worth to the poor , the answers are more like 45 percent , 75 percent , 90 percent .
if it 's yellow , it 's 40 to 60 percent .
now i 'm going to show you how business as usual will affect this .
if you look at the lens of public wealth as against the lens of private profits , you get a completely different answer , which is clearly conservation makes more sense , and not destruction .
it causes pollutants being issued , which have an economic cost , health cost and so on .
i think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital .
calculating this at the national level is one thing , and it has begun .
so in fact , the price of timber in the beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within china .
but if we look at companies like puma — jochen zeitz , their ceo and chairman , once challenged me at a function , saying that he 's going to implement my project before i finish it .
this can be done .
so we actually have some movement forward .
so that 's almost an eighth of society .
thank you .
by the time kids are 11 , 50 percent of them have fallen so far behind in their education that they have no hope to recover .
as i started this project , i was very painfully aware of two things .
but what was also interesting was that none of them actually scaled .
learning levels of children have stopped declining , and they have started going up .
but they do n't mean anything if you do n't understand something much more fundamental .
the story starts in kenya in december of 2007 , when there was a disputed presidential election , and in the immediate aftermath of that election , there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .
i could do this all day every day and i ca n't keep up .
that 's all it is , but that 's all that 's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population — everybody knows where the violence is , but no one person knows what everyone knows — and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it , and it maps it and it makes it public .
we were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us .
but it turns out we also like to create , and we like to share .
and so they went and studied 10 daycare centers in haifa , israel .
the white group there is the control group ; they change nothing .
the fine broke the culture of the daycare center .
but that 's not right .
not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations incompatible , that incompatibility can persist over long periods .
here is the critical difference between these : lolcats is communal value .
what 's going to make the difference here is what dean kamen said , the inventor and entrepreneur .
that , we get for free .
thank you very much .
and so this played out for us in a couple different ways .
this is the most complex .
jihad means to strive to one 's utmost .
in 1971 we were in bangladesh when everything changed .
why did he die and i lived ?
i carried on .
muslims against muslims .
we told ourselves we were fighting for the oppressed , but these were unwinnable wars .
that people who engage in violent jihadism , that people who are drawn to these types of extremisms , are not that different to everyone else .
i want to devote my talk today to the act of speaking itself , and how the act of speaking or not speaking is tied so indelibly to one 's identity as to force the birth of a new person when it is taken away .
so i 've decided to recruit some of my ted friends to read my words aloud for me .
two weeks later , i was ready to return home .
so thank you , leonard cohen , for saving my life .
( applause ) there was a second surgery — which held up for five or six days and then it also fell apart .
there are all sorts of html codes you can use to control the timing and inflection of computer voices , and i 've experimented with them .
i felt , and i still feel , a lot of distance from the human mainstream .
even then , i 'm aware that most people have little patience for my speaking difficulties .
so chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice using my tv show voice from a period of 30 years .
but it was n't that simple .
this was a computer-assisted instruction system , which in those days ran on a computer named illiac .
( laughter ) ce : all of this has happened in the blink of an eye .
this whole adventure has been a learning experience .
i have also met many other disabled people who communicate this way .
i would be trapped inside my head .
so it was this incredibly terrifying event .
and they passed through the detector .
so let me take a moment to tell you what i mean by a gravitational wave .
that 's a decimal place , 20 zeroes , and a one .
it 's tough .
we found that most people knew they were not supposed to write their password down , and only 13 percent of them did , but disturbingly , 80 percent of people said they were reusing their password .
so if you have to , write your passwords down , but do n't reuse them .
however , when we looked at the survey data , we saw that people were really frustrated by the very complex passwords , and the long passwords were a lot more usable , and in some cases , they were actually even stronger than the complex passwords .
so we tried a few different conditions .
that comes up with something that 's sort of sentence-like .
we wanted to compare them with passwords , and so we had the computer pick random passwords , and these were nice and short , but as you can see , they do n't really look very memorable .
sorry , all of you xkcd fans .
and we wanted to know whether people would actually behave the same way with their real passwords .
the other interesting thing that we found is that when we compared the carnegie mellon passwords to the mechanical turk-generated passwords , there was actually a lot of similarities , and so this helped validate our research method and show that actually , collecting passwords using these mechanical turk studies is actually a valid way to study passwords .
`` it 's called `` '' security blanket . '' '' ( laughter ) and this quilt has the 1,000 most frequent passwords stolen from the rockyou website . ''
are they disney princess fans ?
`` and what we found out — we found 17 people so far , i think , who have the word `` '' monkey '' '' — we found out about a third of them said they have a pet named `` '' monkey '' '' or a friend whose nickname is `` '' monkey , '' '' and about a third of them said that they just like monkeys and monkeys are really cute . ''
so it seems that at the end of the day , when we make passwords , we either make something that 's really easy to type , a common pattern , or things that remind us of the word password or the account that we 've created the password for , or whatever .
( applause )
today i wanted to — well , this morning — i want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation ; about how we can cut congestion , pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars ; and how we can do it with the technology that 's in our pockets .
not self-driving cars .
he said , well , why do n't i just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney — that was slang for a nickel .
because , well , when you ca n't share a car , then you have to own one .
in the us , we spend 7 billion hours a year , wasted , sitting in traffic .
why is that ?
and the bright colors is where we have the most cars .
and once we introduced uberpool , well , you see there 's not as many bright colors .
now , in china everything is supersized , and so we 're doing 15 million uberpool trips per month , that 's 500,000 per day .
but if you charge 60 cents a mile , you 're a criminal .
but what if for 60 cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling in los angeles ?
and what if at 60 cents a mile we could get 50 million people carpooling in the united states ?
you only just talked about a small part of it here — a powerful part — the idea of turning cars into public transport like that , it 's cool .
but i 've got a couple other questions because i know they 're out there on people 's minds .
your supporters and investors , who have been with you the whole way , believe that the only chance of sort of taking on the powerful , entrenched interests of taxi industry and so forth , is to have someone who is a fierce , relentless competitor , which you 've certainly proved to be .
you 're being forced to be , whether you want it or not , a kind of global visionary who 's changing the world .
it 's now in many cities , half the price of a taxi .
what do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time ?
for us it 's an interesting challenge , right ?
the record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive .
during conflict people are doing destruction .
well , the same is true of the music , which my brother and i composed and mapped specifically for central park .
so this is not a playlist or a list of songs intended for the park , but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and blend seamlessly based on a listener 's chosen trajectory .
but it speaks to a larger vision for a music industry that 's sometimes struggled to find its footing in this digital age , that they begin to see these new technologies not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles to an existing model , but to dream up entirely new ways for people to interact with and experience music .
okay , a few of you .
i think they 'd make good allies .
so this was gender training .
watch what 's not .
`` tc : try this : google-image , `` '' professional latin dancer , '' '' and then look for an actual latino person . ''
she ca n't be bolder , he ca n't be gentler .
a lot of accidents could be avoided .
if it still existed .
i 've had someone write and say , scientifically speaking , what is the best and fastest way to hide a body ?
and i 've had people send in what are clearly homework questions they 're trying to get me to do for them .
and i 've tried , i 've met them a few times , tried asking them , and they are n't revealing anything .
there are a few things that i looked at here .
and you can also then put a cap on how much of the world hard drive market are they taking up , which turns out , it 's pretty sizable .
but using some of these same methods , we can look at the nsa 's data centers , and figure out , you know , we do n't know what 's going on there , but it 's pretty clear that their operation is not the size of google 's .
and i posted it on my website . i wrote it up .
so i go and get it , open it up , and it 's punch cards . ( laughter ) google-branded punch cards .
`` there 's a bunch of code , and i get some friends to help , and we crack the code , and then inside that is another code , and then there are some equations , and then we solve those equations , and then finally out pops a message from google which is their official answer to my article , and it said , `` '' no comment . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) and i love calculating these kinds of things , and it 's not that i love doing the math . ''
i do a lot of math , but i do n't really like math for its own sake .
what i love is that it lets you take some things that you know , and just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper , find out something that you did n't know that 's very surprising .
thank you .
and of course , most of you have had three meals today , and probably will continue to have after this event .
and you can see that life expectancy was also short .
but unfortunately , it was n't really fully exploited commercially until after the second world war .
it changed the face of this country , as you can see today and witness .
this is probably the skyline that most of you know about doha .
from having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree , higher than any other nation .
how could we survive that ?
we have no water whatsoever .
there is growing demand , growing population .
and so that number also demands food .
by elevating to a higher socio-economic level , they also change their diet .
they start eating more meat and so on and so forth .
and so someone has to really realize when the crisis is going to happen .
these risks directly affect the sustainability of this nation and its continuity .
is there a sustainable solution ?
so we know very well — i showed you earlier — that we need this energy .
so if we 're going to need energy , what sort of energy ?
that water will go then to the farmers , and the farmers will be able to water their plants , and they will be able then to supply society with food .
so that 's what we are planning to do .
within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation .
aware of the devastation and the challenges , i was keen among many other women to rebuild the libyan civil society , calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
after a period of 33 years in exile , i went back to libya , and with unique enthusiasm , i started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
with an amazing group of women , i co-founded the libyan women 's platform for peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
one day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and sufi tombs .
i am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections .
we need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
`` in turn , the word `` '' raheem , '' '' which is known in all abrahamic traditions , has the same root in arabic as the word `` '' rahem '' '' — womb — symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all peoples , have emanated from . ''
i got permission in the end after about a year to basically do it as a side project .
i want you to think about both sides of that .
those sorts of things are not , they 're not out there , and in fact they 've acquired a certain amount of privacy .
it allows us to talk . anybody can talk to anybody .
so here are some of the things which maybe threaten the social web we have .
i want a web which has got , for example , is a really good basis for democracy .
`` after some awkward silence , he goes , `` have you forgotten your name ? '' ''
i 've been a bear .
( laughter ) safwat saleem : i 've been a whale .
( laughter ) ss : and my personal favorite is frankenstein 's monster .
it felt like i had finally arrived .
( voice-over ) ss : audio editing is like photoshop for your voice .
and if i stutter along the way , and if i stutter along the way , i just go back in and fix it .
it 's magic .
but the people commenting did not know how self-conscious i am about my voice .
they were mostly reacting to my accent , that it is not normal for a narrator to have an accent .
one library that keeps track of characters in the children 's book collection every year , found that in 2014 , only about 11 percent of the books had a character of color .
( video ) characters : thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you .
they 're healthy ; they 're clean — it 's amazing .
and on day six , they basically threw in the towel .
but perhaps their greatest innovation was this .
of course , it 's not just about stealing things .
what to do ? what to do about all this ?
( applause ) so it 's time for change .
to the first question , 63 percent of people said yes , we like it .
and this was not a misplaced feeling .
crime did fall .
we removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks .
he did not know each and every one of them , but with an admirable ingenuity , he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign .
this is politics , not from top down , but from the bottom up , and sideways , and allowing everybody 's voice to be heard is exactly what we need .
i want to make more change as prime minister of my country , but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to .
i think of like , transformers , like how panels open and then they fold , they fold in , and then you close that panel .
♫ fly baby ! up to the sky ♫ ♫ spread my wings and fly ♫ instrumental !
earlier , i was going to say into the depths of the atlantic , but we do n't have to go too deep to reach the unknown .
but look closely , and living inside of this animal is another organism that is very likely entirely new to science .
not quite .
our collective optimism is reflected by the growth of biotechnology across the globe , striving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases .
we relentlessly quantify , analyze and compare , and some of this is absolutely invaluable and indeed necessary .
these animals did not get the memo .
i want to talk to you about the power of stories , of course , but i also want to talk about their limitations , particularly for those of us who are interested in social justice .
the suspect has been apprehended , and they make him give me my bike back , and they also make him apologize .
`` and i think it would be important for audiences to demand more buttons on their favorite websites , buttons for example that say , `` '' if you liked this story , click here to support a cause your storyteller believes in . '' '' or `` '' click here to contribute to your storyteller 's next big idea . '' '' often , we are committed to the platforms , but not necessarily to the storytellers themselves . ''
`` alice walker has said , `` '' look closely at the present you are constructing . ''
( applause )
there are things they care about .
the informal economy , it 's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics : it 's not supposed to be there , but it 's huge .
in dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself , but it performs services for the city at large .
in this case , supply right next to demand .
connectivity between the city and the country is what 's going to keep the country good , because the city has interesting ways of doing things .
and they are regionally separated .
just ask the coal miners in australia .
it 's good for their prosperity .
and biotech is moving rapidly in africa , at last .
so here is where we are .
but beyond the staggering numbers , what 's truly important from a global health point of view , what 's truly worrying from a global health point of view , is that the vast majority of these affected individuals do not receive the care that we know can transform their lives , and remember , we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions , medicines , psychological interventions , and social interventions , can make a vast difference .
any case , i went on , i soldiered on with psychiatry , and found myself training in britain in some of the best hospitals in this country . i was very privileged .
in india , i found the situation was not a lot better .
in reality , take a guess .
the idea is actually quite simple . the idea is , when you 're short of specialized health care professionals , use whoever is available in the community , train them to provide a range of health care interventions , and in these books i read inspiring examples , for example of how ordinary people had been trained to deliver babies , diagnose and treat early pneumonia , to great effect .
and in my own trial in goa , in india , we again showed that lay counselors drawn from local communities could be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions for depression , anxiety , leading to 70 percent recovery rates as compared to 50 percent in the comparison primary health centers .
well , in part , because health care in the developed world , the health care costs in the [ developed ] world , are rapidly spiraling out of control , and a huge chunk of those costs are human resource costs .
indeed , to implement the slogan of health for all , we will need to involve all in that particular journey , and in the case of mental health , in particular we would need to involve people who are affected by mental illness and their caregivers .
it 's gotten smaller , it 's got less detail , less resolve .
that 's what we want to see . that 's why it 's hard .
it 's scattering inside the telescope , creating that very bright image that washes out the planet .
it would be the same thing if i put my thumb up and blocked that spotlight that 's getting right in my eye , i can see you in the back row .
spitzer 's suggestion was we do this in space .
so there 's that big screen , and there 's no planets , because unfortunately it does n't actually work very well , because the light waves of the light and waves diffracts around that screen the same way it did in the telescope .
it starts wrapped around a hub .
it separates from the telescope .
we ran this test 16 times , and 16 times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter .
( music ) all right , so it 's a delicate dance .
so if i show you another song off this album , and another , your eyes will easily pick out the use of repetition by the band nirvana , and in the frequency distribution , the colors , you can see the clean-dirty-clean sound that they are famous for , and here is the entire album as a single visual impression , and i think this impression is pretty powerful .
`` at least , it 's powerful enough that if i show you these four songs , and i remind you that this is `` '' smells like teen spirit , '' '' you can probably correctly guess , without listening to any music at all , that the song a die hard nirvana fan would enjoy is this song , `` '' i 'll stick around '' '' by the foo fighters , whose lead singer is dave grohl , who was the drummer in nirvana . ''
this is data from a skate park , and this is mabel davis skate park in austin , texas . ( skateboard sounds ) and the sounds you 're hearing came from eight microphones attached to obstacles around the park , and it sounds like chaos , but actually all the tricks start with a very distinct slap , but successful tricks end with a pop , whereas unsuccessful tricks more of a scratch and a tumble , and tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong , and voices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park .
this is all 40 minutes of the recording , and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made , and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a cheer , and if you look really closely , we can tease out traffic patterns .
i think , after 30 years , the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning .
this time , i 'm not going to talk at all .
please meet jane .
and after many trials and tribulations and years of endeavors , we were able to come up with this flexible electronic patch that was manufactured using the same processes that they use to build computer chips , except the electronics are transferred from a semiconductor wafer onto a flexible material that can interface with the human body .
we can not outsmart all the hackers in the world , but perhaps we can present them a smaller target .
thank you .
well , that 's because fish , first of all , float .
( applause )
ca : ok .
ca : it led to you publishing a famous paper together .
and vertices minus edges plus faces still equals two .
so , this is called the euler characteristic .
it 's pretty amazing .
but that 's just an example .
but i know that it 's there .
that 's hot enough to melt lead .
so that 's more than 100 trillion miles .
eric berlow : i 'm an ecologist , and sean 's a physicist , and we both study complex networks .
and then we thought , you know , there are thousands of other talks out there , especially tedx talks , that are popping up all over the world .
and we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other .
we can take natural language processing algorithms to kind of read through with a computer , line by line , extracting key concepts from this .
cameron russell talking about image and beauty connected over into europe .
we 've got education connected to storytelling triangulated next to social media .
and we can see that the new , emerging , top trending topic is about digital privacy .
so we 're using these network motifs to find talks that are unique , ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields , ones that are central to their topic , and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields .
bj : so this production was seen by tom morris of the national theatre in london .
there is very little 20th century technology in them .
ak : other emotional stuff .
you see the skeletal structure of it .
they have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production .
and it 's very much an in-the-moment activity that they 're engaged in .
i 'm , among several other things , an electrical engineer , and that means that i spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology , and more specifically designing and building electronics .
would n't that be so cool , and that would n't that open up all sorts of new possibilities ?
( music ) ( applause ) so the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this , and so the way that we 're approaching that is by teaching workshops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools , and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways .
and so sometime soon , you 'll be able to play and build and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way .
so thank you very much . ( applause )
this is probably the most boring topic of the whole morning .
but we have a problem .
but we 're spending 36 percent .
now this leaves 10 percent deficit , sort of a mind-blowing number .
how could you have a problem like this ?
there 's no real , true balancing going on , and in a sense , the games they play to hide that actually obscure the topic so much that people do n't see things that are actually pretty straight-forward challenges .
that is , through various gimmicks and things , a so-called balanced budget had led him to have 25 billion missing out of the 76 billion in proposed spending .
now he 's put together some thoughts : about half of that he 'll cut , another half , perhaps in a very complex set of steps , taxes will be approved .
this is so blatant , so extreme .
and california 's not unique .
and everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem .
so far it 's meant layoffs , increased class sizes .
`` within the education community there 's this discussion of , `` '' should it just be the young teachers who get laid off , or the less good teachers who get laid off ? '' '' and there 's a discussion : if you 're going to increase class sizes , where do you do that ? how much effect does that have ? ''
that 's something i think is very , very important .
but with the type of cuts we 're talking about , it will be far , far harder to get these incentives for excellence , or to move over to use technology in the new way .
everybody has an opinion .
we need better accounting .
we need to take the fact that the current employees , the future liabilities they create , that should come out of the current budget .
we need to understand why they 've done the pension accounting the way they have .
it should be more like private accounting .
it 's the gold standard .
and so the bottom line is we need to care about state budgets because they 're critical for our kids and our future .
and that 's why the story was news .
but the campaign never meant to shame anyone .
and if we allow social media to deliver that , then it can deliver a very powerful form of justice , indeed .
a father came out of his house to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk , to get home , finish their schoolwork , and prepare themselves for bed .
in the investigation that followed before the actual trial , each of the other five teenagers was shown photographs , the same photo array .
the other comes from an interesting aspect of human memory that 's related to various brain functions but i can sum up for the sake of brevity here in a simple line : the brain abhors a vacuum .
so now , when it 's important for us to be able to recall what it was that we experienced , we have an incomplete , we have a partial store , and what happens ?
but it happens without awareness such that you do n't , are n't even cognizant of it occurring .
it happens to us in all the aspects of our life , all the time .
well , what 's that got to do with this ?
now , he did n't use a real gun in his hand , so he had a black object in his hand that was similar to the gun that was described .
the other one that i want to suggest , the caution that all of us have to have , i constantly have to remind myself , about just how accurate are the memories that we know are true , that we believe in ?
thank you . ( applause )
what i want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what 's scheduled .
it 's an old new york school building , nothing fancy .
they still have old blackboards and whatnot .
( laughter ) and this young man , his name is — his last name cruz — he loved it . that 's all over his facebook page and it 's gone viral . ( laughter )
`` and i let them go for about 10 seconds , then i go , `` '' at ease ! '' '' `` `` huh ! '' '' ( laughter ) `` yes , general . yes , general . '' ''
and we would bring them into the army , and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure , put them in ranks , make them all wear the same clothes , cut all their hair off so they look alike , make sure that they are standing in ranks .
we teach them how to go right face , left face , so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions .
and then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately , the drill sergeant .
`` once that structure is developed , once they understand the reason for something , once they understand , `` '' mama ai n't here , son . ''
in 18 weeks , they have a skill . they are mature .
when does the learning process begin ? does it begin in first grade ?
and we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing , they 've got their little knapsack on and they 're ready to go , and then they realize they 're not like the other first graders who know books , have been read to , can do their alphabet .
and so my whole life then was dedicated to rotc and the military .
and i say to young kids everywhere , as you 're growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you , always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing , and when you find those two things together , man , you got it .
that 's what 's going on . and that 's what i found .
they never left . ( laughter ) i , so help me god , i grew up walking those streets , and they were always there .
it 's a country of such contrasts , but it 's a nation of nations .
we are a nation of immigrants .
got ta have a dirty water dog . ( laughter ) and no matter where i am or what i 'm doing , i 've got to do that .
but i got ta have my hot dog .
and the scene repeats itself so often .
america has paid me . i never forget where i came from .
thank you very much .
rm : it 's a distinct symbol of chicago pride .
i also think that people love chicago more because the flag is so cool .
new york state is one of only two in the u.s .
they play the little high school kid games with each other .
i was n't impulsive , i did n't react right away , because i know this is their house .
and there is a major shift coming on the horizon .
government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
for those of us on the ground in those early days , it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans that haiti was something different .
it has been used to signal early warning in advance of weather-related disasters .
kibera is one of africa 's largest slums .
it 's on the outskirts of nairobi , the capital city of kenya .
young people living in kibera in their community , with simple handheld devices , gps handheld devices and sms-enabled mobile phones , have literally put themselves on the map .
one idea that i 'd like you to consider , for instance , is to take a look at our it departments .
i extract information from a specific environment using very low-tech data collecting devices — generally anything i can find in the hardware store .
i use natural reed , because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that i can not fully control .
i also translate weather data into musical scores .
so all of these scores are made up of weather data .
meanwhile , i use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this , that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization , but now they 're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score , so it can actually be read as a musical score .
thanks to the support of the google earth team , i now have this .
truly impressive .
your regular cup of coffee , 54 degrees c , an extra-hot one , well , 60 .
what 's , again , amazing are these temperatures .
because that 's the question , one of significance .
he did n't set out to kill or maim me , gill hicks .
all i shared with them was my first name .
and i was n't ready for that all to end .
i held on for almost an hour , an hour to contemplate the whole of my life up until this point .
what did i feel ?
like dane atkinson .
thank you .
because for me , equations and symbols are n't just a thing .
half a kilometer underground .
this was the ice age .
and she 's just turned 18 .
no , i do n't think so .
but it did n't always look like this .
`` i fear the boat is going to sink . '' '' and bassem said to her , `` '' please be patient . ''
her glucose levels were dangerously low .
`` `` '' doaa , do you know what happened to my brother ? ''
and it had this photo .
but is that more important than saving human lives ?
thank you .
you ca n't even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now .
and it was perfect — it was perfectly insulting .
and the range of stories are varied and diverse , but they also make up a universal tapestry .
when we step outside that range , we get punished in a variety of ways .
what is power ?
`` now , many of you have heard the phrase the `` '' double bind '' '' and connected it with one thing , and that 's gender . ''
but hannah riley bowles and emily amanatullah have discovered there 's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious .
so let 's do a little experiment .
we often get self-focused .
how do we do that ?
well , one of the ways is be a mama bear .
the self-promotion double bind is that if we do n't advertise our accomplishments , no one notices .
but if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments , we are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable .
when we have high power , we already have credibility .
when we lack power , we do n't have the credibility .
and one of the ways we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion .
`` i 've had people do this all over the world and i asked them , `` '' what did you notice about the other person when they described their passion ? '' '' and the answers are always the same . ''
i want to end with a few words from my late father that he spoke at my twin brother 's wedding .
`` play it well , and your days will be mostly joyful . '' '' what my dad was saying is that we 've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world . ''
so when a scene calls for it , be a ferocious mama bear and a humble advice seeker .
and if you use those tools — and each and every one of you can use these tools — you will expand your range of acceptable behavior , and your days will be mostly joyful .
i was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
i took a couple victory laps in there .
and with the help of skype , that is what we are going to attempt today .
i 'm joined by singers from cal state long beach , cal state fullerton and riverside community college , some of the best amateur choirs in the country , and — ( applause ) — and in the second half of the piece , the virtual choir will join us , 30 different singers from 30 different countries .
every japanese kid learns how to fold that crane .
and this example is the latter .
`` `` all right , but you 're going to go in full time once you graduate . '' ''
( laughter ) they sell glasses online .
`` to find out , i 've been studying people that i come to call `` '' originals . '' '' originals are nonconformists , people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them . ''
and they look nothing like i expected .
i would wake up at 5am , start playing and not stop until i had mastered them .
to find out , we designed some experiments .
he toiled on and off for 16 years on the mona lisa .
he wrote as much in his journal .
that was not in the script .
and because the text was n't set in stone , he had freedom to improvise .
they had backup plans lined up , and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original , because i expected that originals would look something like this .
it 's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that ca n't get the green light for more than half a century .
take the guy who invented this .
no . you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb .
those machines have no place for empathy .
in october , i spent some time in the democratic republic of congo , which is the [ second ] largest country in africa .
this might not sound like a large number , but in a country with 76 million people , it means there are 930,000 that are infected .
which is why , in part , donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost .
damien runs a hotel outside of kinshasa .
now damien knows all about condoms , but he does n't sell them .
the different types of writing in africa , first was proto-writing , as illustrated by nsibidi , which is the writing system of a secret society of the ejagham people in southern nigeria .
shü-mom is a writing system .
the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition , is as potent as it has always been , if only designers could look within .
i 've had some time to think it over .
fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections .
so , here 's one . there 's another one which i studied .
that 's five cents each , and times 3,000 cars per day , that 's $ 51,000 per year .
`` so , it makes one wonder , `` '' why is it there ? '' '' i mean , why is there that stop sign in each direction ? ''
`` you could n't suddenly tell everyone , `` '' ok , remember what you used to do at yield signs ? now do something different . '' '' that would not work . ''
and it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
when people come to an unfamiliar situation they do n't know how to deal with they slow down .
( applause )
but by 2050 , it will affect 150 million people — which , by the way , will include many of you .
cutting one wire might do nothing .
and you can see they 're clearly sick .
but to grow that hope , to finally beat alzheimer 's , we need help .
we need you to raise awareness that alzheimer 's is a disease and that if we try , we can beat it .
in the case of other diseases , patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments , the pharmaceutical industry , scientists and regulators .
so , it really is down to you .
thank you .
so in the process , i start thinking , well what else might they know about me ?
when i was in elementary school , my next door neighbor , he gave me a book for my birthday .
now , the kicker is , everything i 'm about to do here you can do at home , because we built this for the public for you guys to use .
so the earth is cool , but what we really want to show are the spacecraft , so i 'm going to bring the interface back up , and now you 're looking at a number of satellites orbiting the earth .
we have n't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites .
well , a lot of what nasa does is robotic exploration , and we have a lot of spacecraft out there .
anyway , while we 're here , again , if you want to visit anything , all you need to do is double-click .
so i 'm just going to double-click on vesta , and here we have dawn orbiting vesta , and this is happening right now .
and just being able to visit different places and go through different times , we have data from 1950 to 2050 .
and i 'm going to recenter the camera on saturn , here .
if you want to keep going , if you want to change the camera angle , you can do that , and because of that , i can show you that voyager 1 does n't just fly by saturn .
it actually flies underneath saturn .
i 'm going to go back to today , now , and i want to show you where voyager 1 is .
you order an airline ticket ; you end up in timbuktu .
milo : i could just squish it .
pm : okay . so what we 're going to do now is teach milo to skim stones .
some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side .
but he gave me a cup of tea .
and i understood that his surprise was my protection .
so i have been walking and traveling , by horses , by yak , by truck , by hitchhiking , from iran 's border to the bottom , to the edge of the wakhan corridor .
this is aliso canyon .
so what is it that we fear ?
you know how you 've got 10 years where you 're demonstrating that reactor ?
the truth is , there 's real questions about how much of that we 're going to do .
and what about the waste ?
we must fight with an inventive approach .
in 1975 , i met in florence a professor , carlo pedretti , my former professor of art history , and today a world-renowned scholar of leonardo da vinci .
one that we [ see ] here , masaccio , the church of santa maria novella in florence , so we just said , well maybe , visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by leonardo , since he was a great admirer of leonardo da vinci .
well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . many political reasons .
we came back in the hall of the 500 in 2011 , and this time , with a great group of students , and my colleague , professor falko kuester , who is now the director at cisa3 , and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left .
there is a lot of varnish still sitting there , several retouches , and some over cleaning . it becomes very visible .
this is not just a curiosity , because it changes not just the iconography as you see it , but the iconology , the meaning of the painting , and we believe this is a cool way , easy way , that everybody could have access to , to become more the protagonist of your own discovery , and not just be so passive about it , as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums .
`` `` it feels so bad , something 's got ta be working there . '' ''
you 'll see lung cancer , for example , on the rise .
now , why is that ? anyone knows , by the way ?
i do n't want to miniaturize the progress and everything that 's been done in cancer research .
so this is not a simple decision to make , and unfortunately this is the decision that brain cancer surgeons have to take every single day as they 're seeing their patients .
we said , hey , how about instead of using sugar molecules , let 's maybe take tiny , tiny little particles made of gold , and let 's program them with some interesting chemistry around them .
if you 're a healthy cell , we 're moving on .
( applause )
it would start a whole new space race .
so with characters , you can make stories .
because what can you do with that data ?
how many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have ?
as a kid , i would puzzle over questions just like this .
it was n't a very big bump , but it was big enough to make you raise your eyebrow .
i mean , if i did n't discover a particle — and i did n't — if i did n't discover a particle , why am i here talking to you ?
particle physicists are explorers .
new particles can either show up immediately as big , obvious-to-spot bumps , or they can only reveal themselves after years of data taking .
we build a bigger machine .
planning is already underway for a 100-kilometer tunnel
( applause )
nope .
there 's a new industry in town , a 22 billion-dollar , 2.2 billion sq . ft. industry : that of personal storage .
so how can you live little ?
so i 'm not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq . ft .
( applause )
( applause )
and that can be seen directly through a microscope , and i 'm going to show you some of this today .
so you could fit 10 human cells across the diameter of a human hair .
and it 's looking around , and when it finds something , and recognizes it being foreign , it will actually engulf it and eat it .
so this little ant that 's crawling here , it 's like it 's in a little willy wonka land .
here 's a close-up picture , or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth , and if you had really , really good vision , with your naked eye , you 'd see it about that well .
i want to talk about something really ordinary , just ordinary sand .
you have things like coral .
there 's some sand that 's really much more colorful .
and you can see those in micrometeorites .
this is some micrometeorites that the army gave me , and they get these out of the drinking wells in the south pole .
and i started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes .
this was the first picture i took . it was kind of amazing .
and you can see here that that is — that 's sort of vaporized , and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together .
and many of the grains of sand on the moon look like that , and you 'd never find that on earth .
it was first excavated in 1961 as they were building lax , although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 before common era , when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants .
it is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located , of course , at stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design , the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously , the much better access to parking .
( applause ) ( music ) ah yes , a table .
every now and then , i admit that i complete a phone call on it occasionally .
and yet i forget about it all the time .
therefore , it must be good for the environment .
so when people are looking at the plastic bag , it 's likely they 're thinking of something like this , which we all know is absolutely terrible , and we should be avoiding at all expenses these kinds of environmental damages .
so we need to find innovative ways of solving some of these problems that we face .
they seem logical , right ? yeah .
the reason is because there 's a unique phenomenon that happens in the u.k .
the moment that very popular tv shows end .
they have so much locked up inside them .
thank you so much .
in theory , refugees are a shared global responsibility .
we chose uganda not because it 's representative of all host countries .
in the new world , migration is not going to go away .
man 4 : you ready ? you ready ? ( barking ) woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , take a picture .
child : whoa ! look at that snake !
man 7 : after this bridge , first exit .
`` woman 4 : google `` '' jellyfish . '' '' ( music ) man 10 : it 's beautiful . ''
though in all seriousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that 's one of the reasons behind this project , project glass .
okay . and i do n't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot , but i want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it .
you saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there .
my vision when we started google 15 years ago was that eventually you would n't have to have a search query at all .
this project has lasted now , been just over two years .
we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job , and then she almost ran away screaming .
but we 've come a long way .
but they do n't exist . so i 'm having to make them .
i 'm working with architect neil spiller at the bartlett school of architecture , and we 're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach .
this little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living .
so what we 're trying to do is , we 're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture , which contrast the current , victorian , top-down methods which impose structure upon matter .
would it give this block of limestone new properties ?
so , you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light , toward the dark foundations .
the protocells can actually move away from the light .
they can actually also move towards the light . you have to just choose your species .
this is terrestrial chemistry . we 've all got it , which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for first world countries .
and finally , an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one .
i knew they would .
a thank you can change a life .
this is a recent comic strip from the los angeles times .
but if i was to say that they 're both examples of alternative or new forms of currency in a hyperconnected , data-driven global economy , you 'd probably think i was a little bit bonkers .
and that 's not surprising , if you think about the basket case that is the e.u .
these are the more polite ones i could share with you today .
loyalty essentially is a micro-economy .
you think about rewards schemes , air miles .
and you think , is it much of a leap ?
there were 8,000 kinds of notes in america .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
the second is an aim : we should have more trust .
and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things .
across the last few decades , we 've tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness .
the aim , i think , is more trustworthiness , and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people , and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy .
but trust , in the end , is distinctive because it 's given by other people .
so you have to , i think , be trustworthy .
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy .
the shop where i buy my socks says i may take them back , and they do n't ask any questions .
i think there 's a big lesson in that .
it is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy .
and they 're the masters .
and i began to work as an animal protection lawyer .
so now we needed to find our chimpanzee .
tommy was a chimpanzee . we found him in that cage .
we found kiko , who is partially deaf .
there 's no photoshop here .
and the images were always completely unexpected in the end , because i could have a very specific image about how it would turn out , i could paint it to match that , but the moment that sheila laid back into the milk , everything would change .
when we started out on the milk project , and when i started out , i could n't have foreseen that i would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tripping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk .
thank you .
but it does n't have much to do with what a library actually does today .
the new york times called this building a miracle .
that 's how we end up with buildings like this .
everything is different now .
and so , coming directly from there to here .
and now they 've got transport ; they take it on the logging trucks or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it .
and so many of these diseases , like asthma and certain kinds of cancers , are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped .
we want to go and work in a dog shelter .
there are nine billion humans coming our way .
the second thing you need is light .
it 's actually faster to read than to view .
who 's the teacher ?
thank you .
so that is my claim .
why ?
so this is the stuff that we do .
but think about it : this is an equation .
let 's do another experiment .
so four-thirds is in the sphere . it 's the volume of the sphere .
ok , so why am i doing all this ?
how do you know that ?
this is a square pyramid .
and if i take a bicycle pump and just pump it up , you can see that this is also a little bit like the octahedron .
do you see what i 'm doing here ?
we can look at the waves .
we can feel salt on our tongues .
so when we do this , and we 've taken this journey into the ocean , we use our imagination .
we can do a little game .
so my advice to you is : try to change your perspective .
it makes you open to new things , and it makes you able to understand things .
shaheen 's background i do n't even know .
and that 's what i 'm here for , asking for your support , demanding for your support , requesting for your support .
sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
that 's the beauty of randomization .
the second one is : if i give bed nets for free , are people going to use them ?
we can just run an experiment .
and so i think what needs to happen is we need to help each other .
thank you for joining us today .
`` ( applause ) ( applause ends ) and this one 's called `` '' the ghost light . '' '' lit from within is the sole secure way to traverse dark matter . ''
`` `` this dark hour '' late summer , 4 a.m . ''
there will be other dawns , nights , gaudy noons .
thank you .
that 's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear .
soon after , an organization i volunteer with , all hands volunteers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response efforts .
and everyone was doing the same .
as they had run from the wave , and for their lives , absolutely everything they had , everything had to be left behind .
the day i gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son 's 14th birthday .
after six months in japan , 1,100 volunteers had passed through all hands , hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean over 135,000 photographs , the large majority — ( applause ) — a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
during this time , we had n't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was printer inks .
they 're our memory-keepers and our histories , the last thing we would grab and the first thing you 'd go back to look for .
so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ?
and the same tone is going to play , and the light is going to flash again .
it 's a fascinating place . it 's a huge place .
it 's twice the size of australia , a continent that is the same size as china and india put together .
some of you may know the story .
and of course some strange and predictable combination of curiosity , stubbornness , and probably hubris led me to thinking i might be the man to try to finish the job .
you can see on the left of this photograph , several square acres of junk waiting to be flown out from the south pole .
it 's like being a drunk toddler .
you become pathetic .
and less than five weeks ago , after 105 days , we crossed this oddly inauspicious finish line , the coast of ross island on the new zealand side of antarctica .
( laughter ) this was december 31 , 1999 , the night of the second coming of christ , and the end of the world as i knew it .
and i thought that if i held on to her hand during this prayer , i might go right on with her .
so i held on and i closed my eyes to listen , to wait .
and the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still .
and the organ rolled on in to add the dirge .
but i was upset on their behalf .
and we hardly realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one brick , because we fear it might shake our whole foundation .
come on , you have dictators ruling the world , population is growing by millions , there 's no more fish in the sea , the north pole is melting and as the last ted prize winner said , we 're all becoming fat .
i started when i was 15 years old .
that 's on the champs-elysees .
i was quite proud of that one .
because i was just 18 and i was just up there on the top of the champs-elysees .
a large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of paris .
all of them are not angels , but they 're not monsters either .
so i went back there with a 28 mm lens .
they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .
not a smile — that really does n't tell about who you are and what you feel .
they all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
we called the project face 2 face .
`` the experts said , `` '' no way . ''
we did n't push the limit ; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought .
when you go in these developing societies , women are the pillars of their community , but the men are still the ones holding the streets .
so we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos .
when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents , i could n't always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict .
most of the places i went to , i decided to go there because i 've heard about it through the media .
all brazil was shocked .
you see that enough in the media .
`` this is art . '' '' i think it 's people 's curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects . ''
women are always the first ones targeted during conflict .
when you look at kibera now , they look back .
but you know how india has a lot of dust in the streets , and the more dust you would have going up in the air , on the white paper you can almost see , but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker .
so the more dust you have , the more it will reveal the photo .
and so in providencia , for example , in the favela , we have a cultural center running there .
`` because of course , when we left , the people who were just at the edge of the project said , `` '' hey , what about my roof ? '' '' so we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project . ''
new york .
so for example , i pasted the photo of the minaret in switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country .
and this starts right now .
take the photos , the portraits , upload it — i 'll give you all the details — and i 'll send you back your poster . join by groups and reveal things to the world .
what we see changes who we are .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
that night began my formal relationship with death — my death — and it also began my long run as a patient .
i revere hospitals for what they can do ; i am alive because of them .
and there was no window in my room , but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky .
we need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population .
beneficence .
instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
we went to mr. mike 's barbershop every other saturday .
`` `` '' hey rev , '' '' they would say to my dad . ''
he 's a local pastor , and they treated him like a celebrity .
the conversations about health were lengthy and deep .
`` `` say , did you hear about jimmy ? he had a stroke . '' ''
`` `` '' did you hear about eddie ? he died last week . ''
not only do you trust your barber with your look and with your style , but you also trust him with your secrets and sometimes your life .
this work led to the development of project brotherhood , a community clinic founded by dr. eric whitaker that provided tailored healthcare to black men .
but while there 's only one project brotherhood , there are thousands of black barbershops where the intersection of health and haircuts can be cultivated .
when you find that place , see the opportunity .
for the last 10 years , i 've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks .
and this spreads on out endlessly into a distance .
but what i 'd like to show you today is a means by which we might get not just rapid warning about an epidemic , but also actually early detection of an epidemic .
there are fewer and fewer people who are still available that you might infect , and then you get the plateau of the curve , and you get this classic sigmoidal curve .
and the lines represent — the dots are the people , and the lines represent friendship relationships .
for instance , sexually transmitted diseases will spread across sexual ties .
but if you can see this image [ of the network ] from a bird 's eye view , you can appreciate that there 's something very different about nodes a and b .
b is located on the edge of the network .
and in fact , if you could do that , what you would see is something like this .
in the dotted red line , we show what the adoption would be in the random people , and in the left-hand line , shifted to the left , we show what the adoption would be in the central individuals within the network .
imagine a very popular person in the social network — like a party host who has hundreds of friends — and a misanthrope who has just one friend , and you pick someone at random from the population ; they were much more likely to know the party host .
and also , we had them [ actively ] email us a couple of times a week .
so the random group is in the red line .
when did the randoms — when did the friends take off and leave the randoms , and [ when did ] their curve start shifting ?
and this type of a visualization can show that epidemics like this take root and affect central individuals first , before they affect others .
would you get any population-level immunity ?
if we could understand how to target , it could affect the efficiency of what we 're trying to achieve .
this is a map of eight million phone users in a european country .
because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom , but where everyone is , and what they 're thinking based on what they 're uploading on the internet , and what they 're buying based on their purchases .
i 'm a feminist , but i 'm a rather bad one .
if a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children , i embrace that choice , too .
i read the words of women who showed me i was not nothing .
what we need are human-centered solutions .
what i wish to do is make every parkinson 's patient feel like my uncle felt that day .
but why ca n't smart be something that 's simple and yet effective ?
all we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity , to go out there , observe .
imagine what we all could do if we all came up with simple solutions .
my dad was a lawyer .
i worked and studied hard to move up the career ladder , eventually becoming a chief financial officer in silicon valley , a job i really enjoyed .
i can surf the web , exchange email with people , and routinely destroy my friend steve cousins in online word games .
it was then i realized that i could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight , giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible .
with chad 's group at brown , i regularly fly drones around his lab several times a week , from my home 3,000 miles away .
and our hope is that , by providing these tools , that you 'll be able to think of better ways to provide movement for the disabled , to provide care for our aging population , to help better educate our children , to think about what the new types of middle class jobs could be for the future , to both monitor and protect our environment , and to explore the universe .
back to you , henry .
our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone 's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe .
or is it observer-relative ?
`` you may recognize it from `` '' 2001 : a space odyssey . '' '' when hal 's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song , as a reference to when computers became human . ''
after previewing it and confirming it 's what you submitted , you could submit it into the mechanical turk with no other context .
more recently , somebody even 3d-printed thom yorke 's head , which is a little creepy , but pretty cool .
and if you find one that you 're interested in , you can actually click on it and open up an information panel where you 're able to rate that frame , which helps it bubble up to the top .
again , you can get the playback and personal contribution .
in addition to that , it 's listed , the artist 's name , the location , how long they spent drawing it .
and then this is , again , the abstract version , which ends up getting a little bit crazy .
and if we use them well , we can live healthier and more beautifully .
this landscape was watered with treated sewage water .
i 'll use a mix .
the poo at the very bottom of all those layers of gravel — not touching anyone — is providing solid food for those marsh plants .
imagine how much energy we could save .
now , some of us are concerned about industrial pollutants contaminating this reuse cycle .
but it was allowed in five other states nearby .
`` brave and open-minded people sat down and felt comfortable saying , `` yeah , that shit makes sense . '' ''
but why were all these projects so innovative ?
how all of you feel is going to determine exactly how innovative we can be .
i have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist since i was 12 years old .
in danger zone i am not authorized to build .
i 'm a writer . i imagine . i make stuff up for a living .
that 's called the hum .
and i am happy .
and it 's not instantaneous , but it happens , it does happen .
well , let 's not get carried away .
the hum is joy-specific .
my tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up .
you can do it too , say yes every time your child asks you to play .
turns out , nothing .
i am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends .
life 's hum .
i said yes to less work and more play , and somehow i still run my world .
the more i play , the better i work .
the more i feel that hum , the more i know who i am .
that part of the job , that 's living the dream .
truth be told , i have never found a role model i could truly identify with .
he had turned a dark shade of pink and had slid under his chair in apparent shame .
two , that i needed another sponsor , and fast .
i apply this lesson equally well to my personal life .
[ be happy , it drives people crazy . ] ( applause ) you see , as a young woman in these situations , you have two options .
some women in the middle east are lucky enough to be married to someone supportive of their career .
to achieve this , i have found the hard way that you need to apply your hard-earned professional skills to your personal life .
just like i would in my business life , i have based the selection of who would support me with my children while i 'm at work on a strong referral .
this lesson applies whatever your childcare situation , whether an au pair , nursery , part-time nanny that you share with someone else .
if there 's only room for one woman at the top , then you ca n't make room for others , much less lift them up .
two hundred years is not a lot of time , while nature had three billion years to perfect some of the most amazing materials , that we wish we had in our possession .
and we produce this mountain every year .
we can do a lot of things with the material .
well , my team decided to do something really cool at the university .
they decided to combine the strongest material produced by the plant kingdom with the most elastic material produced by the insect kingdom — nanocellulose with resilin .
so there are lots of things that can be done with this material .
because collagen accounts for about 25 percent of our dry weight .
so safety is a big issue .
but it 's not the only one .
a heart valve , very similar to the one that i showed you before , seven years ago , was implanted in his body .
actually , it 's happening now .
this is happening now .
so what 's for the future ?
now , this heart is not going to be the same as we can get from a donor .
my friend zion suliman once told me a smart sentence .
and the text is the dna of life .
and it starts with three people .
my high school is chicago , diverse and segregated on purpose .
i hear education systems are failing , but i believe they 're succeeding at what they 're built to do — to train you , to keep you on track , to track down an american dream that has failed so many of us all .
we are good at making war .
they do n't feel emotionally like they just happened yesterday , and that is an immensely better place to be .
and there are trust issues .
because ...
the cave is huge .
his music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me .
thing is , it 's owned by the city .
i use the garden , the soil , like it 's a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that 's my embellishment for that cloth .
i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
i 'm not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
it changed the way our history developed .
but it 's a technology so pervasive , so invisible , that we , for a long time , forgot to take it into account when we talked about human evolution .
so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please .
turn and face your neighbors .
so cooking is a very important technology .
if you can cook , nothing can happen to you , because whatever you find , you will try to transform it .
( laughter ) but it shrunk to 60 percent of primate gut of my body mass .
you can influence your own technologies you have invented .
you need proteins for muscles , recovery .
salty , because you need salt , otherwise your electric body will not work .
think about bittersweet chocolate ; or think about the acidity of yogurt — wonderful — mixed with strawberry fruits .
now 150 years ago , anatomists described very , very carefully — here is a model of a wall of a gut .
the gut is actually the largest immune system , defending your body .
this is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest , which is actually the lumen .
it has 20 different neuron types .
it 's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain , where you have 100 billion neurons .
this control of muscle is very , very important , because , you know , there can be reflexes .
it 's this brain which makes this reflex .
the big brain integrates signals , which come from the running programs of the lower brain , but subsumption means that the higher brain can interfere with the lower .
`` it 's a very big signal ; it 's sent to the brain says , `` go and eat . '' ''
now if we could take this language — and this is a language of structures — and make it longer-lasting , that it can go through the passage of the intestine , it would generate stronger signals .
( applause )
that 's why we heard about the backing away from the kyoto protocol , for example .
you could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago , which was fear .
now what would that look like ?
and even though , for political tactical reasons , the president has been very , very good about saying that islam is not the enemy , nonetheless , there 's a natural impulse when one enters war to think of the other side as an enemy .
and secondly , they are the smallest reality .
it will sit with those who create wealth .
trade and industry takes 43 billion .
`` and given this , we started getting questions like , `` '' if you can grow human body parts , can you also grow animal products like meat and leather ? '' '' when someone first suggested this to me , quite frankly i thought they were a little crazy , but what i soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all . ''
animals are not just raw materials .
what if , instead of starting with a complex and sentient animal , we started with what the tissues are made of , the basic unit of life , the cell ?
already in medicine , biofabrication techniques have been used to grow sophisticated body parts , like ears , windpipes , skin , blood vessels and bone , that have been successfully implanted into patients .
if we can succeed here , it brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat closer on the horizon .
it can have all the characteristics of leather because it is made of the same cells , and better yet , there is no hair to remove , no scars or insect 's bites , and no waste .
this leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet , a handbag or a car seat .
you do n't have that kind of fine control with conventional leather .
rather , it could be much more like this .
it allows us to be creative .
everyone wonders about the next plane .
he recalled promising god , as he lay dying in 2001 , that if he lived , he would serve humanity all his days .
exactly one week 's worth of undies is all i put in my suitcase .
( laughter ) if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
tuesday : fitting in is way overrated .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
because the lesson i 'm trying to learn myself this week is that it 's okay to let go .
when i was a kid , i experienced something so powerful , i spent the rest of my life searching for it , and in all the wrong places .
music goes straight to the emotional vein , into your bloodstream and right into your heart .
it deepens every experience .
i thought if i added more layers on top of the music , i could make the feelings even more powerful .
i could taste the lightning .
this was it five years ago when i ran into it .
but where are we now ?
but vr as a format , as a medium , is n't complete yet .
we 're using your senses as the paints on the canvas , but only two right now .
you 're about to participate in the largest collective vr viewing in history .
( applause ) i believe that everyone on earth needs to experience what you just experienced .
secondly , a political theorist who 's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about .
`` this is the opening of a beautiful novel by jose saramago called `` '' seeing . '' '' but in my view it very well captures part of the problem that we have with democracy in europe these days . ''
for the last 30 years , political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout , and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting .
according to the latest survey being done by the european commission , 89 percent of the citizens of europe believe that there is a growing gap between the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public .
and i 'll start with what went right .
and it was the birth of the global world .
but if we 're going to see what went wrong , we 're going to end up with the same five revolutions .
and it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand .
and i find this very much disturbing when we 're talking about what 's going on right and wrong with democracy these days .
so this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore .
this is the other side of the things that we like .
before , revolutions used to have ideological names .
so for me this is extremely important .
want to hide our soulful eccentricities and authenticity .
and here 's what i learned from laboring women .
and all the while , underneath surface time is this whole other dimension where the past and the present and the future merge and become deep time .
one : uncover your soul .
two years ago , my younger sister came out of remission from a rare blood cancer , and the only treatment left for her was a bone marrow transplant .
i was paid in soul .
we can do this with our siblings and our mates and our friends and our colleagues .
thank you .
and only by paying attention to these things and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in can we make as much progress as we need to .
so we really can make changes .
well , what 's the history of this disease ?
so it was absolutely gigantic .
and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries , it does n't get much investment .
for example , there 's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria .
and when you use indoor spraying with ddt and those nets you can cut deaths by over 50 percent .
but we have to be careful because malaria — the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves .
now we 're on the upswing .
and that should save over two thirds of the lives if it 's effective .
that 's part of the reason we 're here today , part of the reason we 're successful .
and those top 20 percent have been the best in the world , if you measure them against the other top 20 percent .
and that had been covered up for a long time because they always took the dropout rate as the number who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year .
because they were n't tracking where the kids were before that .
they had to raise the stated dropout rate as soon as that tracking was done to over 30 percent .
for minority kids , it 's over 50 percent .
and that does n't seem entirely fair .
there 's many people working on it .
how much variation is there within a school or between schools ?
`` we should find out what they 're doing and transfer that skill to other people . '' '' but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today . ''
and the answer is no .
you might think these are people with master 's degrees .
kipp means knowledge is power .
well , in a normal school , teachers are n't told how good they are .
of course , digital video is cheap now .
`` and so every few weeks teachers could sit down and say , `` '' ok , here 's a little clip of something i thought i did well . ''
you can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it , have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff .
if you have a kid who 's behind , you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept .
but i — i 'm optimistic .
it should n't take away from other things .
girl 4 : we make a school newspaper on the computer .
i stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van , and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus .
for three hours this went on .
we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge .
part of the reason that the near win is inbuilt to mastery is because the greater our proficiency , the more clearly we might see that we do n't know all that we thought we did .
of course one can make a biological argument .
things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away .
because she had saved me .
forced prostitution accounts for 22 percent of human trafficking .
that is food and care and shelter .
it 's found in thailand 's fishing industry .
we 've mostly turned to the criminal justice system .
we often dwell on human trafficking survivors ' victimization .
but that means we are all also part of its solution .
`` and that man told me , `` '' so , here you are . ''
and puzzling it is .
there were many epidemics there .
and i wanted to come home and take a break and maybe start over .
and one was punishment .
we who had worked in behavior knew that punishment was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued .
and so the sense that i had was there was a giant gap here .
and so there 's good news about this , though , because there 's a way to reverse epidemics , and there 's really only three things that are done to reverse epidemics , and the first of it is interrupting transmission .
just like t.b. , but the object is behavior change .
and then a bunch of community activities for changing norms .
and since that time , this has been replicated 20 times .
so violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease .
so i think this is good news , because it allows us an opportunity to come out of the middle ages , which is where i feel this field has been .
for myself , i tried to get away from infectious diseases , and i did n't .
very advanced , no air-conditioning — i love it .
the people 's supermarket .
what does that mean ? another jargon .
young people as well .
we had 330 for 54 seats .
then i arrived in tunisia in 2011 .
`` this means `` '' to notice '' '' in a passive sort of sense , as in , `` '' i noticed he was wearing a light blue shirt . '' '' did i go and check whether the shirt was light blue or not ? ''
that is the role of an election observer .
`` so that 's not quite right either , because there is a term that 's already accepted and in use , which was the word `` '' muraqib '' '' which means `` '' a controller . '' '' it 's got that notion of control . ''
the silent majority needs to know .
my dad was a high-ranking gang member who ran the streets .
but that does n't mean that we ca n't .
it just takes a little bit more .
`` so there were a lot of teachers who were like , `` '' she 's never going to make it . ''
and so every year , i share my background with my kids , because they need to know that everyone has a story , everyone has a struggle , and everyone needs help along the way .
i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before .
but now , shifting an entire paradigm , it has n't been an easy journey , nor is it even complete .
and it was out of fear — fear of , well , what if they get it wrong ?
yeah , what if we get it wrong ?
and we did .
teaching elements of persuasion , it does n't get any more real than that .
because it 's time that kids like me stop being the exception , and we become the norm .
charley williams , a poor sharecropper , would n't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview , but charley had actually been a slave until he was 22 years old .
you go into these booths , you interview your grandmother or relative , you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the library of congress .
jake barton : so i have to say i did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry because they all make you cry .
it 's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse the actual museum 's collection using facial recognition .
and you can see from these images , the site is so raw and almost archaeological .
and so we launched this to capture the stories from all around the world , through video , through photos , through written history , and so people 's experiences on that day , which was , in fact , this huge risk for the institution to make its first move this open platform .
my business partner told me to turn on the television .
it 's the original , excavated wall at the base of the world trade center that withstood the actual pressure from the hudson river for a full year after the event itself .
`` and so these are questions like , `` how can a democracy balance freedom and security ? '' ''
and so these oral histories , which we 've actually been capturing already for years , are then mixed together with interviews that we 're doing with people like donald rumsfeld , bill clinton , rudy giuliani , and you mix together these different players and these different experiences , these different reflection points about 9/11 .
so i 'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices , but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone 's reflection on the event .
you can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial , and you can search for an individual name , or in this case an employer , cantor fitzgerald , and see the way in which all of those names , those hundreds of names , are actually organized onto the memorial itself , and use that to navigate the memorial .
he would n't tell me what happened .
they told me , 'we saw your mom on facebook .
allow me to give you a briefing about my story .
it was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas and imposed on women .
a courageous woman , her name is najla hariri , she 's a saudi woman in the city of jeddah , she drove a car and she announced but she did n't record a video .
what happened next , of course ?
so this time i asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car .
it went fast . we were arrested , signed a pledge not to drive again , released .
i was n't sure why i was sent there , because i did n't face any charges in the interrogation .
( applause ) so i think by now , everyone knows that we ca n't drive , or women are not allowed to drive , in saudi arabia , but maybe few know why .
allow me to help you answer this question .
ah , it 's okay . this is my favorite .
so it 's a totally different picture .
for me , i 'm a proud saudi woman , and i do love my country , and because i love my country , i 'm doing this .
i would listen to what they say , and i would never defend myself with words only .
`` a friend once asked me , she said , `` so when do you think this women driving will happen ? '' ''
thank you . ( applause )
just to clarify : copy editors do n't choose what goes into the magazine .
there is a pact between writers and editors .
the editor never sells out the writer , never goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut or stories that went on too long .
somehow , i 've gotten a reputation for sternness .
`` i 've known ian frazier , or `` '' sandy , '' '' since the early 80s . ''
the dog does n't speak english , or american , or spanish , or french .
and this is what it 's all about .
when you watch people interacting with animals or other people , there is very little feedback , it 's too infrequent .
and i think this whole notion of these skills should be taught .
but they do n't save marriages and they do n't raise children .
you have formulas that long .
now compare that with real price increments .
i mean , you have the typical european cities , with a dense urban core , good public transportation mostly , not a lot of road capacity .
`` back in 1989 , when the berlin wall fell , an urban planner in london got a phone call from a colleague in moscow saying , basically , `` '' hi , this is vladimir . i 'd like to know , who 's in charge of london 's bread supply ? '' '' and the urban planner in london goes , `` '' what do you mean , who 's in charge of london 's — i mean , no one is in charge . '' '' `` `` oh , but surely someone must be in charge . ''
this is what happens when you take away 20 percent of the cars from the streets .
so after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges .
i mean , this was a really fun experiment to start with , and we actually got to do it twice .
and this effect hanged on . so 2007 figures looked like this .
seventy percent of the population did n't want this .
well , think about it this way . who changed ?
each day , people make new decisions , and people change and the world changes around them , and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people do n't even notice .
and after analyzing the answers , it turned out that more than half of them believe that they have n't changed their minds .
the composite combines titanium dioxide with cement .
and for that reason , i 'm continuing to work on this science fair project from 2012 to bring it from the laboratory into the real world .
at first , the first thing i thought was , i want to run away .
second , they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside , and then you need a lot of cooling .
and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa and with ethiopia .
and it 's also between two parallel streets that do n't have any connection for hundreds of meters .
and around this void we placed this idea of the market with small shops , that change in each floor because of the shape of the void .
i also thought , how to close the building ?
and this is complemented by these small colored glasses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night .
and the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day .
and the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the apartment , as an essential part of the master plan .
and also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor .
and it also reinforces this idea of the gates .
we live in a very complex environment : complexity and dynamism and patterns of evidence from satellite photographs , from videos .
it 's a huge challenge to understand .

by the time the pilot had finished , we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join .
`` the film that changed my life is a 1951 film by vittorio de sica , `` '' miracle in milan . '' '' it 's a remarkable comment on slums , poverty and aspiration . ''
`` but for my father , the emotional and artistic importance of de sica 's vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half-century with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends , `` '' in order , '' '' he said , `` '' to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation . '' '' in the last shot of `` '' miracle in milan , '' '' slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms . ''

`` because when these people get home after a screening of `` '' rear window '' '' and raise their gaze to the building next door , they have the tools to wonder who , apart from them , is out there and what is their story . ''
and it 's hard for a couple of reasons .

i toured the world as a headliner on arabs gone wild .
so had the graduate heard the right one word , maybe he would have ended up onstage — oh , i do n't know — maybe with these two .
and that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens .
so we think it 's perfectly normal and natural to change it .
sometimes you just ca n't conceive otherwise .
this is stuff we take for granted today .
so this lifecode stuff turns out to be a superpower .
so , principle number one : we have to take responsibility for this stuff .
these are n't random mutations .
we want to have darwin 's evolutionary system running .
the reason they settled out is because it 's cheaper to settle than to fight the lawsuit — clearly , two million dollars cheaper in some cases , and much worse if you actually lose .
now how did that happen ?
now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they 're able to recover in settlements .
it turns out , because they 're paid on contingency , it works really , really well in reverse .
so unfortunately i 'm not smart enough to have a solution for the patent troll problem .
this is a painting from the 16th century from lucas cranach the elder .
every culture , every civilization has dreamed of finding eternal youth .
there are people like alexander the great or ponce de león , the explorer , who spent much of their life chasing the fountain of youth .
but what if there was something to it ?
we can do cognitive tests , we can do imaging — all kinds of sophisticated testing .
so , how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism .
and vice versa : as the brain gets older , does that influence the rest of the body ?
and the way this looks is shown in this graph .
but what 's really exciting are the outliers , as they so often are in life .
is this a person at an increased risk of developing an age-related disease ?
`` so , parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together , and that leads then to a shared blood system , where we can now ask , `` '' how does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood ? '' '' and for this purpose , we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20-year-old people , and old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years . ''
it can be rejuvenated .
so there are old-blood factors that can accelerate aging .
but for me , the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise .
for this reason , the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the higgs boson could not be the full story .
instead , so far , the measurements coming from the lhc show no signs of new particles or unexpected phenomena .
and this substance may seem invisible to us , but it has a physical reality .
it surrounds us all the time , just like the air we breathe in this room .
besides the known higgs state , there could be a second state in which the higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today , and the mere existence of another state of the higgs field poses a potential problem .
if the ultra-dense higgs state existed , then , because of quantum tunneling , a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time , and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water .
the higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse .
in about five billion years , our sun will become a red giant , as large as the earth 's orbit , and our earth will be kaput , and in a thousand billion years , if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate , you will not even be able to see as far as your toes , because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light .
so it is really unlikely that we will be around to see the higgs field collapse .
from this , we discovered that the higgs field that permeates space-time may be standing on a knife edge , ready for cosmic collapse , and we discovered that this may be a hint that our universe is only a grain of sand in a giant beach , the multiverse .
( applause )
`` we say , `` '' hello , how are you ? ''
they have something else .
i get all kinds of stories .
they were unexpected pleasures .
but most strangers are n't dangerous .
i read the obituaries almost every day .
well , first we looked at words .
film , theatre , music , dance and of course , art , are huge .
so what if we analyze these two groups separately — the famous and the non-famous ?
what might that tell us ?
so does a site like this have rules ?
it is where a third of all the traffic is going .
ca : but you still live at home , right ?
the content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
but to start it probably helps to have an understanding of what a 404 page actually is .
they 're on sites big , they 're on sites small .
you can type in an url and put in a 404 and these will pop .
so it was a moment in time where all of these startups had to sit and think and got really excited about what they could be .
paper maps are becoming obsolete .
but you and i and other innovators , we can see the potential in this next leap in accuracy .
i could build for you a structure up here in 3d , millimeter accurate , that only you could see , or my friends at home .
so this level of positioning , this is what we 're looking for , and i believe that , within the next few years , i predict , that this kind of hyper-precise , carrier phase-based positioning will become cheap and ubiquitous , and the consequences will be fantastic .
the woman on the other end of the line , we 'll call her carol , was panicked .
with a flip of the switch you create a bubble around you within which gps signals ca n't reside .
they get drowned out by the bubble .
and limor designed this , in part , because , like carol , she felt threatened by gps tracking .
it might be deadly .
the fake signals now completely control this gps receiver .
can someone really manipulate the timing and positioning of a gps receiver just like that , with a spoofer ?
the key is that civil gps signals are completely open .
we simply can not tolerate gps jammers and spoofers , and yet , given the lack of effective legal means for protecting our privacy from the gps dot , can you really blame people for wanting to turn them on , for wanting to use them ?
you 'll never lose track of your things again .
so the prediction test failed .
what about failure , though ?
how is that going ?
it just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
now , i 'll count to three , and on the count of three i 'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you . ok ?

( music ) ( applause ) thank you . ( applause ) thank you .
and he despised it from the bottom of his heart .
we have got , under our skin , a layer of fat , all over : nothing in the least like that in any other primate .
that would be very sad .
it ended with a new synthesis : darwin 's ideas and mendel 's ideas blending together .
so if it 's going to come and it 's going to happen , what 's holding it up ?
what i want to talk to you about is what we can learn from studying the genomes of living people and extinct humans .
so if we add in a chimpanzee here , we will see more differences .
approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee .
each of us , of course , contains two human genomes — one from our mothers and one from our fathers .
and together with the methods to date these genetic differences , this has led to the insight that modern humans — humans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me — evolved in africa , quite recently , between 100 and 200,000 years ago .
and since there are many genetic variants , and they have different such gradients , this means that if we determine a dna sequence — a genome from one individual — we can quite accurately estimate where that person comes from , provided that its parents or grandparents have n't moved around too much .
well we can begin to ask those questions also .
maybe a single individual is misclassified or so .
there is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that i think is worthwhile to consider , and that is that , in a very literal sense , they 're really on the surface of our bodies .
so there 's another interesting thing that comes from this realization that humans have a recent common origin in africa , and that is that when those humans emerged around 100,000 years ago or so , they were not alone on the planet .
they should be equal , have no reason to be closer to one african than another african .
but this is different if we now look at the european individual and an african .
the same is true if we look at a chinese individual versus an african , the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often .
so having now a neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the dna , we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world .
and the first place we 've done that is in southern siberia in the altai mountains at a place called denisova , a cave site in this mountain here , where archeologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone — this is a copy of it — that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human .
so from studying these genomes of extinct humans , we 're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like when modern humans started coming out of africa .
we mixed with these earlier forms of humans , wherever we met them , and we mixed with each other ever since .
when i turned 18 , i lost my best friend to a car accident .
and then i decided i 'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year .
so we decided at stanford to build a different self-driving car .
yet i still had n't saved a single life .
we 've driven from san francisco to los angeles on highway 1 .
now i think there 's a vision here , a new technology , and i 'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars .
and this is what i 'll tell you about .
one is the focused ultrasound , and the other one is the vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging .
you see the phantom within the aquarium .
we can do it without harming any tissue .
john is a retired professor of history from virginia .
and medication did n't help him anymore .
so we put the patient on the mr table .
the only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse .
`` he said , `` '' miraculous . '' '' and his wife said , `` '' this is the happiest moment of my life . '' '' and you wonder why . ''
i mean , one of the messages i like to carry over is , what about defending quality of life ?
i mean , those people lose their independence .
they are dependent on others .
he returned to a normal life routine .
pain is something that can make your life miserable .
and people are suffering from all kinds of pain like neuropathic pain , lower-back pain and cancer pain from bone metastases , when the metastases get to your bones , sometimes they are very painful .
and his wife actually took him .
so again , this is an immediate relief .
and this is , in 2004 , the fda has approved mr-guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids .
in all our treatments , the patient holds a stop sonication button .
so do n't fear , this is not going to be a cooking demonstration .
but i do want to talk to you about something that i think is dear to all of us .
unless you 're on one of these californian low-carb diets , bread is standard .
who prefers the whole-meal bread ?
of course , the reality is quite different .
and it means that you now eat products , which can come from all around the world .
this tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world .
and that is the result , directly , of being so successful at increasing the scale and volume of our production .
and it frees us all up to do other things — to sit at ted meetings and not to worry about our food .
and large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes , destruction of biodiversity — still a lonely emu here in the brazilian cerrado soybean fields .
what we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about .
it was invented by farmers in iraq and syria in particular .
now it is not surprising that with this massification and large-scale production , there is a counter-movement that emerged — very much also here in california .
and the fallacy comes from idealizing a past that we have forgotten about .
so local food production is out .
the main driver of that is actually meat .
what you see is that we 've started in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture , which was sort of small-scale and low-control .
and we also need to re-examine livestock .
i want to have horticulture and greenhouses on top of residential areas .
food is as important as energy , as security , as the environment .
and never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap .
it 's not about nutrients and calories .
`` he did not speak about rice , in india . he said , `` '' to those who have to go without two meals a day , god can only appear as bread . '' '' and so as i 'm finishing my bread here — and i 've been baking it , and i 'll try not to burn my hands . ''
have some of it .
the idea was to bring together some of britain 's greatest institutions , some international ones , and to create a new system of synergies .
and he built exhibition road , a linear sequence of those institutions .
and i want to end on a project that is very small , in a way , very different : a floating cinema in the ocean of thailand .
and then there are the new challenges , which we do n't expect .
and if you have more consideration for others , you are not going to ransack that planet that we have and at the current rate , we do n't have three planets to continue that way .
fortunately , there is the evolution of culture .
and we need to dare altruism .
this was a person that nobody seemed to be missing .
a better life is a life in safety .
but are they really ?

nextpedition turns the trip into a game , with surprising twists and turns along the way .
so that haunting story has led me to my job .
jh : this is different .
there 's a much more apocalyptic sort of feeling .
and there have been some unexpected counter-effects to that .
so in america , one of the big — actually , america and europe — one of the biggest ones is world war ii .
because you can have an argument or a disagreement about something , you can get angry at someone .
if you look at the faces — if one of the couple shows disgust or contempt , that 's a predictor that they 're going to get divorced soon , whereas if they show anger , that does n't predict anything , because if you deal with anger well , it actually is good .
i 'm afraid that this whole generation of young people , if their introduction to politics involves a lot of disgust , they 're not going to want to be involved in politics as they get older .
disgust . how do you defuse disgust ?
and then gradually that chips away or changes your category as well .
so you have to first separate your feelings about the candidate from your feelings about the people who are given a choice .
and what i 've found from being in the middle and trying to understand both sides is : both sides are right .
but these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard .

i did not want to study surgery . do n't ask me why .
step a. step b. step c. mostly .
now , i have a great affinity for charles babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture . ( laughter ) he was a very wealthy man , and a sort of , part of the aristocracy of britain , and on a saturday night in marylebone , were you part of the intelligentsia of that period , you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree — and he invited everybody : kings , the duke of wellington , many , many famous people — and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines .
so let 's talk about the memory . the memory is very like the memory of a computer today , except it was all made out of metal , stacks and stacks of cogs , 30 cogs high .
the cpu could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic — so addition , multiplication , subtraction , division — which already is a bit of a feat in metal , but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator does n't : this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision .
now , imagine these soirees , all these great and good comes along .
it 's not , historically , totally accurate that she 's the first programmer , and actually , she did something more amazing .
now , a hundred years later , this guy comes along , alan turing , and in 1936 , and invents the computer all over again .
`` he laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science , and said , `` it does n't matter how you make a computer . '' ''
over in swindon , the science museum archives , there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by charles babbage about this analytical engine .
now , i 'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the cpu mechanism working .
so this is just three sets of cogs , and it 's going to add . this is the adding mechanism in action , so you imagine this gigantic machine .
the blue dots are the sites that i 've actually navigated directly to .
i go to work , i check email , i log onto a few more social sites , i blog , i check more news reports , i share some of those news reports , i go look at some videos , pretty typical day — in this case , actually fairly pedantic — and at the end of the day , as my day winds down , look at my profile .
the red dots have exploded .
the gray dots have grown exponentially .
pretty simple — it 's huge business .

`` so little billy goes to school , and he sits down and the teacher says , `` what does your father do ? '' ''
since then , what 's happened ?
in afghanistan , for example , we have n't just had one election or two elections . we 've gone through three elections , presidential and parliamentary . and what do we find ?
and when i have conversations with people , i remember having a conversation , for example , in iraq , with a community that asked me whether the riot we were seeing in front of us , this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building , was a sign of the new democracy .
well , what is the answer to this ? is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy ?
`` the result was that i found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people , this is actually a photograph taken in libya but i saw the same scene in iraq of people standing outside screaming for the elections , and when i went out and said , `` '' what is wrong with the interim provincial council ? ''
we need to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights matters because of the other things it brings , or women 's rights matters for the other things it brings .
but if we 're really to make democracy vigorous again , if we 're ready to revivify it , we need to get involved in a new project of the citizens and the politicians .
and part of that activity is honesty .
it 's a question of what the citizens do .
in other words , if democracy is to be rebuilt , is to become again vigorous and vibrant , it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians , but for the politicians to learn to trust the public .

each outcome is shown by one of these markers , and each sits on a row that represents a level of wealth and retirement .
at the end , there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement .
by using this tool over and over and simulating outcome after outcome , people can understand that the investments and savings that they undertake today determine their well-being in the future .

so they took away the architecture , they kept the base of the artwork , and they built an entirely new , much more biomorphic architecture on top of that .
what are the causes ? well , it 's an unintended consequence .
but my very favorite project of all was over 15 years ago , when i was a part of the team that made the very first accurate , three-dimensional map of a subterranean surface .
it 's a shared resource from which we all drink .
and the only people in there is a bartender and an old man nursing a beer .
we 're born for them .
you 've gone through hundreds of tv channels , just switching channel after channel , and then suddenly you actually stop on one .
make the audience put things together .
stories are inevitable , if they 're good , but they 're not predictable .
and the idea is that the character has an inner motor , a dominant , unconscious goal that they 're striving for , an itch that they ca n't scratch .
i took to this like a duck to water .
wall-e 's was to find the beauty .
all you can do is learn to recognize it and own it .
if things go static , stories die , because life is never static .
but more importantly , have you made me want to know how it will all conclude in the long-term ?
`` an example would be in `` '' finding nemo , '' '' in the short tension , you were always worried , would dory 's short-term memory make her forget whatever she was being told by marlin . ''
`` you 've got to remember that in this time of year , 1993 , what was considered a successful animated picture was `` '' the little mermaid , '' '' `` '' beauty and the beast , '' '' `` aladdin , '' `` lion king . '' ''
we did n't have any influence then , so we had a little secret list of rules that we kept to ourselves .
`` and they were : no songs , no `` '' i want '' '' moment , no happy village , no love story . ''
so let 's make him selfish . and this is what you get .
hey , off the bed !
i do n't think what you did was right .
we realized , you can make him kind , generous , funny , considerate , as long as one condition is met for him , is that he stays the top toy .
`` and that was the year that they restored and re-released `` lawrence of arabia . '' ''
and it was n't until , on one of my later viewings , that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he 's walked across the sinai desert and he 's reached the suez canal , and i suddenly got it .
and this is what my mother took me to when i was five .
the water 's stiff .
bambi : yippee !
and that 's what i think the magic ingredient is , the secret sauce , is can you invoke wonder .
( video ) ( crying ) marlin : there , there , there .
and today , after briefly describing what they found , i 'm going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery , namely the possibility that way beyond the earth , the milky way and other distant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse .
i 'm going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts .
that 's like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster .
now if you saw an apple do that , you 'd want to know why .
well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of einstein 's .
maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue , a technical detail of interest to experts , but of no relevance to anybody else .
but there 's a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory does n't quite work .
but string theory says that , on fantastically small scales , there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them .
so particle masses , the strengths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions .
from five , the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands — a large , but still manageable , collection to analyze , since after all , graduate students need something to do .
well some researchers lost heart , concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions , each giving rise to different physical features , string theory would never make definitive , testable predictions .
so hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number , 93 million miles , well that is simply wrongheaded .
it tells us how the universe evolved after the bang , but gives us no insight into what would have powered the bang itself .
instead the fuel not only generated our big bang , but it would also generate countless other big bangs , each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes .
the extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
and they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit — a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong .
but would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge ?
sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law .
thank you very much .
we know what they are .
i 'm sorry , there 's nothing normal about this .
and yet i think it 's this perspective of us as humans to look at our world through the lens of normal is one of the forces that stops us developing real solutions .
so i started to go around the world finding the best and brightest scientists i could at universities whose collective discoveries have the chance to take us there , and we formed a company to build on their extraordinary ideas .
six and a half years later , a hundred and eighty researchers , they have some amazing developments in the lab , and i will show you three of those today , such that we can stop burning up our planet and instead , we can generate all the energy we need right where we are , cleanly , safely , and cheaply .
in winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
one of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material , carbon , that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor , and when the vaporized carbon condenses , it condenses back into a different form : chickenwire rolled up .
it 's a thousand times more conductive than copper .
when we run out of water , as we are in some parts of the world and soon to be in other parts of the world , we 're going to have to get this from the sea , and that 's going to require us to build desalination plants .
but in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply , we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need .
it 's been a long time in coming for me .
18 years ago , i saw a photograph in the paper .
thank you .
and on monday , they announced that they had found it .
the main advantage of this system is weight and complexity .
that 's a helium truck in the background .
it takes about an hour to get the suit on .
this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for 15 miles .
it 's forming a pipe .
and that prevented a very serious potential problem .
what i 'm going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so is tell you about an idea of how we 're going to make matter come alive .
and as an inorganic chemist , my friends and colleagues make this distinction between the organic , living world and the inorganic , dead world .
before we do that , i want to kind of put biology in its place .
and so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way .
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer .
biologists seem to think so .
of course , they 're not alive .
and as i pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
we 're awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards .
if we can make matter alive , would we have a matterhazard ?
and from this stuff we came .
and this one happens to be a good source of all 20 amino acids .
they took the basic ingredients , put them in a single jar and ignited them and put a lot of voltage through .
and the key thing is to have lots of complex chemistry just bubbling away .
and just a few months ago in my lab , we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them .
and all i wanted to show you is we can set up molecules in membranes , in real cells , and then it sets up a kind of molecular darwinism , a molecular survival of the fittest .
molecules are competing for stuff .
we should take our inspiration from biology .
the real issue in cellular biology is we are never going to understand everything , because it 's a multidimensional problem put there by evolution .
evolution can not be cut apart .
they 're inanimate , they 're not alive .
and because we shared our genetic information with linda , she could see that harriet and i shared a very rare type of mitochondrial dna — haplotype k1a1b1a — which meant that we were distantly related .
what i 'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies .
but if you think about it , if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day — two , four , eight , 16 — in 15 days you have 32,000 .
so if you think about it , these are really dramatically improving .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
but where i think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging .
and now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available , and essentially learn how to reconstruct , and maybe even re-engineer , or backwards engineer , the brain so we can better understand pathology , disease and therapy .
well now there 's essentially a virtual colonoscopy .
oh , we might have missed it , but using a.i . on top of radiology , we can find lesions that were missed before .
here in the netherlands , i think it 's more than 80 percent .
here my friend jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so i can save her a trip to the emergency room — i can do some diagnostics that way .
now we 're also in the era , today , of quantified self .
there 's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate .
and i would argue , in the future , we 'll have wearable devices in our clothes , monitoring ourselves 24/7 .
`` it 's going to be `` '' check your body '' '' light , and go in and get it taken care of . ''
still in clinical trials , but imagine when we can connect these , for example , to the amazing bionic limb , such as the deka arm built by dean kamen and colleagues , which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who 's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they 've had in the past .
now how about other exponentials ?
or for those of us who are sighted , how about having the assisted-living contact lens ?
bluetooth , wifi available — beams back images to your eye .
microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians .
my data indicates that i 've got about average risk for developing macular degeneration , a kind of blindness .
i 'm at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes .
this has been called by lee hood , the father of the field , p4 medicine .
we can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized ; and more importantly , it 's going to become increasingly participatory .
so i 'll finish up with exponentially better .
what if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension ?
this is a new device that is essentially doing that .
how about more targeted therapies for cancer ?
the cancer stem cells remain , and the tumor can return months or years later .
so i 've studied a lot about stem cells — embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful .
we 've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease .
and we 're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering , and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3d organ printing — replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3d organ .
but i think , as integration of exponential technologies , this is the example .
and as a cancer doctor , i 'm looking forward to being out of a job .
and then , when i was in tenth grade , i went to this school , indian springs school , a small boarding school , outside of birmingham , alabama .
and so i started to learn , because learning was cool .
it got bigger ; it contained more places .
`` i realize that these are silly ideas , but they are also `` '' learny '' '' ideas , and that was what was so exciting to me , and if you go online , you can find communities like this all over the place . ''
because they see our passivity as their opportunity .
but growing up as a child with the books around everywhere , with people to talk to about those books , this was n't a sort of slightly learned thing .
and what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995 .
and i began to start thinking of myself as we start having mash-ups of fact and fiction , docu-dramas , mockumentaries , whatever you call it .
we start labeling information for the fact percentage ?
you do n't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
meanwhile the exact same year , at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
let me show you how they work .
( laughter ) but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
it 's a lobster made of playdough that 's afraid of the dark .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
now , i know everyone thinks that their kid is the most fantastic , the most beautiful kid that ever lived .
at five years old , i thought everyone had a life just like mine .
all these amazing things that i was being exposed to and experiencing , i felt i was n't really supposed to have .
is it really that hard to understand why these kids perform well and these kids do n't ?
but while we all know things were indeed separate , they were in no ways equal .
they know that when it comes to schooling , black lives do n't matter and they never have .
`` and then they 'd say , almost suspiciously , `` but they 're brand-new . '' ''
`` the whole experience hit home for me when one of my girls , as she peeled open a crisp paperback said , `` '' ms. sumner — you know , i figured you bought these books , 'cause you teachers are always buying us stuff . ''
i 'll tell you : they 're my kids .
and here 's what the checklisted childhood looks like .
well , we parents , we parents are pretty sure it 's all worth it .
but really , here 's why .
so what are the right questions when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for our children ?
in this episode , the main-course mystery ingredient was quinoa .
it was a pappardelle with italian sausage , kale , parmesan cheese .
something that would stick to their ribs , she said .
cheryl talked about how , by the time monday came , her kids ' hunger pangs were so intense that they could n't even begin to think about learning .
the only thing .
she 'll have lower levels of anxiety and depression .
overall , allison is in much better health than the average school kid .
well , unfortunately , it 's pervasive .
for free .
their chances of graduating increase by 20 percent . 20 percent .
now , you do n't have to trust me on this , but you should talk to donna martin .
they loved the better nutrition , and they loved not being hungry .
( laughter ) and coach parker , he credited that championship to donna martin .
ok. i want you to close your eyes .
human beings are remarkable at taking trust leaps .
and the third level is about using little bits of information to decide whether the other person is trustworthy .
the man who had his eyes wide open , he might lend it to me , and if i did n't pay him back , you 'd all know i was dodgy .
it 's widely talked about how trust in institutions and many corporate brands has been steadily declining and continues to do so .
he was perplexed at how a company that depends on the willingness of strangers to trust one another could work so well across 191 countries .
and the reason why i would never do this as a guest on airbnb is because guests know that they 'll be rated by hosts , and that those ratings are likely to impact their ability to transact in the future .
now , we will see cases of abuse of distributed trust .
every day , five million people will take a trust leap and ride with uber .
( laughter ) another one in a monitor screen in his eye line .
what are we not dealing with ?
we ca n't do it for them . they have to do it for themselves .
thank you so much for your time . i appreciate it .
it 's not harmful ; it has just repaired the muscle .
thanks very much for listening .
now when i got out , i was diagnosed and i was given medications by a psychiatrist .
the second half was just one big nap , pretty much , in class .
`` a different book was written not too long ago in the mid-90s called `` '' touched with fire '' '' by kay redfield jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which mozart and beethoven and van gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with . ''
so it was n't all the good side of the illness .
( laughter ) your call . your call .
and here it is .
here are the reasons .
it 's unpleasant . it 's not right .
we need investment overseas in a sustainable , responsible , ethical and moral way . yes . yes .
where does this start ? it starts here .
most people believed it was proteins .
it alters our personalities .
rl : no , i do n't agree with that .
where 's the cure for schizophrenia ?
it was later developed into ace inhibitors .
these are the people who know nature best .
these are nukaks . they were contacted in the '80s .
millions of people living here , stretched over many kilometers .
this is a fee-pay school . this is a good school .
yet , everyone knows what is a chinese restaurant .
`` what kind of a mother were you ? '' '' i still ask myself those same questions . ''
but there are no simple answers .
i did n't know about any of this until months after his death .
their thinking is impaired and they 've lost access to tools of self-governance .
two years after the shootings , i got breast cancer , and two years after that , i began to have mental health problems .
you know , it 's kinda weak .
there is no way in the world that we , as a community , should be calling the police for kids playing ball in the street .
it was those guardians , it was that village mentality .
it would take care of itself .
yes , yes , yes , women have almost caught up .
it was supposed to be our strength , was n't it ?
how are you going to succeed ?
today it 's 50/50 .
that 's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing , a better life for people .
and they estimated that in 2008 , kenya had per child mortality of 128 .
then it just took another three months for [ the ] u.n. to get it into their server , and on friday we got the new trend line — it was down here .
i was actually , on friday , sitting in front of my computer , and i saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning .
they start [ in ] 1990 — they measure to 2009 .
`` they say , `` '' 0.9 percent , no progress . '' '' that 's unfair . ''
they have 2.4 percent .
this was the backlash in kenya , and ghana bypassed , but then kenya and ghana go down together — still a standstill in congo .
you can see it does n't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement .
their countries are so different , and they merit to be recognized in the same way , as we do n't talk about europe as one place .
but we had that habit in sweden , you know , that we counted all the child deaths , even if we did n't do anything about it .
but you do n't talk about it so much .
they had high , or very high , child mortality and family size , six to eight .
and the ones over there , they were so-called western countries .
what i want you [ to do ] now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size .
here we come down with the eradication of smallpox , better education , health service .
it got down there — china comes into the western box here .
what do my bookshelves say about me ?
and when i thought about it , it seemed like a real shame .
but it started with some practical problems .
having spent my life reading almost exclusively british and north american books , i had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world .
i could n't tell you how to source a story from swaziland .
i would n't know a good novel from namibia .
now , i had no idea whether anyone would be interested , but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online , people started to get in touch .
and pretty soon , it was strangers .
morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way .
( applause )
ks : i have a crossfader .
i do n't have the answer , just in case .
it 's called the arab spring .
it has nothing to do with the fact that i was born there , of course .
now this is very unusual , because globally we find that , not surprisingly , people feel better as their country gets richer .
`` in their own words to an open-ended question we heard , `` '' their political system is transparent and it 's following democracy in its true sense . '' '' another said it was `` '' liberty and freedom and being open-minded with each other . '' '' majorities as high as 90 percent and greater in egypt , indonesia and iran told us in 2005 that if they were to write a new constitution for a theoretical new country that they would guarantee freedom of speech as a fundamental right , especially in egypt . ''
islamists , not the young liberals that sparked the revolution , won the majority in parliament .
what really changed after the ouster of mubarak was n't that life got easier .
but people 's expectations for their future went up significantly .
and this empowerment also applies to women , whose role in the revolts can not be underestimated .
a full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas to ask or to demand liberty and justice in egypt were women .
after i graduated from the yale law school and got my first law job , my new haven analyst , dr. white , announced to me that he was going to close his practice in three months , several years before i had planned to leave new haven .
white had been enormously helpful to me , and the thought of his leaving shattered me .
`` now i 'm going to quote from some of my writings : `` '' i opened the door to my studio apartment . ''
i was gaunt . i walked as though my legs were wooden .
`` my doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia , and gave me a prognosis of `` '' grave . '' '' that is , at best , i was expected to live in a board and care , and work at menial jobs . ''
instead , i 'm a chaired professor of law , psychology and psychiatry at the usc gould school of law , i have many close friends and i have a beloved husband , will , who 's here with us today .
i sometimes have the idea that nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain .
everyone has seen a street person , unkempt , probably ill-fed , standing outside of an office building muttering to himself or shouting .
'memos are visitations , ' i informed them .
it 's a flat surface . it 's safe . ' rebel and val followed and they asked what had gotten into me .
'this is the real me , ' i announced , waving my arms above my head .
`` one of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me against my will was that i was `` gravely disabled . '' ''
after returning from a trip to oxford , i marched into kaplan 's office , headed straight for the corner , crouched down , covered my face , and began shaking .
all around me i sensed evil beings poised with daggers .
is it okay if i totally trash your office ? ' 'you need to leave if you think you 're going to do that , ' said marder .
tell them not to kill me . what have i done wrong ?
`` he said , `` '' did you quit or were you fired ? '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' 'i give life and i take it away . ''
`` if you hear nothing else today , please hear this : there are not `` '' schizophrenics . '' '' there are people with schizophrenia , and these people may be your spouse , they may be your child , they may be your neighbor , they may be your friend , they may be your coworker . ''
a message to the entertainment industry and to the press : on the whole , you 've done a wonderful job fighting stigma and prejudice of many kinds .
some of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like , and i thought i 'd give you a quick insight into my career so far .
this is what someone that specializes in malware and hacking looks like .
you can go online and buy a hacking service to knock your business competitor offline .
if you want your business competitors to go down , well , they can .
i want to show you a couple of my favorites .
so is n't it amazing how much control the attackers can get with such a simple operation ?
it 's code which will be interpreted on the webpage .
chasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day is a massive challenge , and those numbers are only growing directly in proportion to the length of my stress line , you 'll note here .
using the email address , the telephone number and the gps data , on the left you see an advert for a bmw that one of our cybercriminals is selling , on the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens .
they were working on the third floor .
that 's right , cybercriminals do have christmas parties , as it turns out .
you do it every time you take out your iphone or your blackberry and connect to something like tedattendees .
so i ran a little scan .
we called it that at one of our conferences because we thought that would freak people out , which is quite fun .
`` next time you install something , look at the settings and ask yourself , `` '' is this information that i want to share ? ''
however , 99 percent of it works because people fail to do the basics .
we 're all one family .
but it 's not just what he stood for , it 's what his message was .
sometimes we make food , too .
( applause )
i have asked her to translate for me .
hp : ( in chinese ) yr : i used to read spider-man comics , watch kung fu movies , take philosophy lessons from bruce lee .
be water , my friend . ( applause ) yr : this year , i am 32 years old , the same age bruce lee was when he died .
i have been wondering recently , if he were alive today , what advice he would give me about making this ted talk .
( applause )
it 's the runs , the hershey squirts , the squits .
but then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget , and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply , which is great ; we all need water .
they 've been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in .
it 's got nutrients in it .
she gets a dose of healthy human feces , and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent .
maybe it 's the ick factor .
so the idea is to manipulate human emotion .
they tried selling soap as healthy . no one bought it .
it 's about 50 or so years off track .
they 've made it conversational .
they talk about it . they 've sanitized it .
well , in 1945 , supreme court got a chance to address that question .
the law — the law is like that ambulance that shows up and is ready to treat emma only if it can be shown that she was harmed on the race road or on the gender road but not where those roads intersected .
so what do you call being impacted by multiple forces and then abandoned to fend for yourself ?
they 've been killed in their living rooms , in their bedrooms .
why do n't we know these stories ?
i 'd like those of you who are able to join us in saying these names as loud as you can , randomly , disorderly .
thank you for joining us .
out of a list of 26 topics , salary is only number eight .
and if you spend a lot of time in hospital , you 'll see a lot of types of irrationalities .
what would happen to the other people in the group ?
zipcar buys cars and parks them throughout dense metropolitan areas for people to use , by the hour and by the day , instead of owning their own cars .
i call this peers , inc .
what does it do really well ? it creates economies of scale , significant and long-term resource investment , the expertise of many different kinds of people and different kinds of minds , and for individuals , consumers , it 's bringing the standards , rules and recourse that we really want as consumers , and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise , and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation .
so we have the peers that are providing the services and the product , and the company that 's doing the stuff that companies do .
and not just easy things that anyone can do .
when i talked to their ceo , he had this great line .
`` he said , `` '' we have a community that owns its own company . '' '' and then my all-time favorite , etsy . ''
`` you mean all i have to do is build a platform and all these people are going to put their stuff on top and i sit back and roll it in ? '' '' building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do . ''
there are many , many examples and i 'll give you one that is not my favorite example : insurance .
it took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right .
they need a low deductible , and 24-hour roadside assistance .
so going back , this is my look of excitement and joy , because all this stuff that i 'd also been hoping for actually really did happen , and what 's that ?
`` a driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of france and the owner gave it to them , and said , `` '' you know what , here 's where the cliffs are , and here 's all the beaches , and this is my best beach , and this is where the best fish restaurant is . '' '' and the peers also become , peers and owners create relationships , and so at the last minute people can — a driver can say , `` '' hey , you know what , i really need the car , is it available ? '' '' and that person will say , `` sure , my wife 's at home . go pick up the keys . go do it . '' ''
so i continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe .
so for me , it 's a collaboration .
europe at the time was in the middle of the euro crisis , and all the headlines were about european countries getting downgraded by rating agencies in the united states .
but for ratings , a crucial element of our economy , we really do not know what all the different ingredients are .
it was usually too hot , too stuffy or just too smelly , and my father would not let us use the air conditioner .
they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere , and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities , where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas , but we also have problems that , when we lose power , we ca n't open a window here , and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again .
if we look at biology , and many of you probably do n't know , i was a biology major before i went into architecture , the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body , and it 's a fantastic thing .
and the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very , very specific to its location , to the angle of the sun , and also how the thing actually curls .
and look at the position of the old west .
but there 's another type of transformation that occupies a very different emotional space .
but there are things that organizations do that make change even harder and more exhausting for people than it needs to be .
most transformations have financial and operational goals .
expanding globally ?
it 's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art .
and there it goes .
it 's 27 kilometers in circumference .
and we sat here and we looked at these two problems , and finally we came to a realization . these are n't problems .
this was a tragedy , but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing .
and so , as we evaluated , and as the dust settled from this tragedy , we realized that , of those two problems — in the initial iteration of our organization , we were a disaster response organization that was using veteran service . we had a lot of success , and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm .
they send him to iraq .
is there anything unique about human beings ?
there is .
we need to know why people are doing what they 're doing .
would you like to see it ? i brought some with me .
turns out it was n't so easy .
so this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin , have to grab it fast and keep it cold .
if you 're so virtuous , show me the money .
so we recruit some people for an experiment .
so oxytocin is the trust molecule , but is it the moral molecule ?
so it 's empathy that makes us connect to other people .
`` a then unknown philosopher named adam smith wrote a book in 1759 called `` '' the theory of moral sentiments . '' '' in this book , smith argued that we are moral creatures , not because of a top-down reason , but for a bottom-up reason . ''
but knowing that molecule is valuable , because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off .
in particular , it tells us why we see immorality .
opens it up and there 's a pearl necklace inside .
`` we have to find the owner for this . '' '' i said , `` '' yea . '' '' so we 're trying to decide what to do with this , and the phone rings . ''
`` so i said , `` '' i 'll hold it for you . '' '' he said , `` '' you know , you 've been so nice , let 's split the reward . '' '' i 'll give you the jewelry , you give me a hundred dollars , and when the guy comes ... `` '' you see it . i was conned . ''
so this is a classic con called the pigeon drop , and i was the pigeon .
they have many of the attributes of psychopaths .
but interestingly , high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish .
they checked .
there you go . that 's connection .
come here . give me a hug .
( applause )
you can imagine the range of content that that gets .
jennifer lawrence and several other actors had their icloud accounts hacked , and private , intimate , nude photos were plastered across the internet without their permission .
the documents which received the most attention were private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value .
with every click , we make a choice .
`` researcher brené brown said , and i quote , `` shame ca n't survive empathy . '' ''
and that way i can have a greater impact on the world .
could i be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions ?
all i 'm doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots from blue to black or black to blue .
they give you a survival advantage .
( laughter ) ( applause ) the species almost went extinct .
how can it be that not seeing the world accurately gives us a survival advantage ?
there 's something that exists when you do n't look , but it 's not spacetime and physical objects .
we can not see them with our naked eye .
will they feel excommunicated as i did ?
information access empowers us to flourish .
we need to build a log cabin , if you will , at the bottom of the sea .
we did a lot of science , and again , because of the luxury of time , we were able to do over three years of science in 31 days .
it 's available to every one of us .
let me show you a quick video of what this camera does .
when i was a kid — i was about eight years old .
it 's called subtext .
so how do i start all this ?
( applause )
and these are all of the known near-earth asteroids , which at last count was 13,733 .
let me tell you one more story .
no more years of the cup .
i 've got a great idea that 's going to change the world .
i went to mit . ok , we 'll figure that out .
we took all that information together .
it 's doing that based on the content inside the images .
( laughter ) but i recited a cheer . i recited a cheer along with everybody else .
and they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
`` western societies , and in particular the u.s. , have always favored the man of action over the `` '' man '' '' of contemplation . ''
guess what ?
`` here 's margaret atwood , `` '' cat 's eye . '' '' here 's a novel by milan kundera . ''
it was my version of my grandfather 's hours of the day alone in his library .
whatever it is , i hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy .
we most certainly do talk to terrorists , no question about it .
naturally , it would follow that you meet kind with kind .
for my part , what i wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand , say , coca-cola .
it 's not going to happen , i do n't think .
our target audience , it 's not just the producers of terrorism , as i 've said , the terrorists .
now , staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds , think about delivery mechanisms .
we 've got to practice what we preach .
so we 've got to find a different mechanism , and one of the best mechanisms i 've ever come across is the victims of terrorism .
you can see their scars . you trust them .
but whether it 's victims , whether it 's governments , ngos , or even the queen yesterday , in northern ireland , we have to interact and engage with those different layers of terrorism , and , in effect , we do have to have a little dance with the devil .
this is my favorite part of my speech .
we 're all victims of terrorism .
there 's a very young , attractive lady over here , and she has something which i think 's the worst form of psychological , physical injury i 've ever seen out of a suicide bombing : it 's human shrapnel .
what it means is , when she sat in a restaurant in years to come , 10 years to come , 15 years to come , or she 's on the beach , every so often she 's going to start rubbing her skin , and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel .
9/11 launched it . it was its big marketing day , and it was packaged for the 21st century . they knew what they were doing .
there 's a bomb , people start suing .
we became , or those victims became , more importantly , a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization .
the advantages of dialogue are obvious .
governments are receptive . it wo n't come from those dusty corridors .
therefore i believe it should not be cool .
i 've always been an opponent of it . i think emotion is needed .
risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent .
and as great as these books were , you could always tell that you were getting close to the full effect .
`` but the reason that i mention it is that early on , rabassa offers this elegantly simple insight : `` '' every act of communication is an act of translation . '' '' now maybe that 's been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i 'd encountered that exact difficulty on a daily basis , i had never seen the inherent challenge of communication in so crystalline a light . ''
what i want to talk about is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has at circumventing our ingrained perspectives — comedy as the philosopher 's stone .
they were lifted verbatim from palin 's own remarks .
now it 's not often that i 'm going to associate the words honesty and integrity with limbaugh , but it 's really hard to argue with that punchline .
and guess what ?
now this is doubly ironic when you consider that what gives comedy its edge at reaching around people 's walls is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection .
why is this remotely controversial ?
`` now by taking the biblical epithet `` '' abomination '' '' and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence , a baby , this joke short circuits the emotional wiring behind the debate and it leaves the audience with the opportunity , through their laughter , to question its validity . ''
there are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline .
now governor perry of my newly-adopted state of texas was pushing this same line this past summer at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign for the republican presidential nomination , proclaiming over and over that the science was n't complete at the same time that 250 out of 254 counties in the state of texas were on fire .
and this cartoon hit the bull 's eye .
i 'm not asking a lot .
it 's profitable to have an unsafe working environment .
so i decided to engage this particular problem .
it says a lot about her .
and for the last decade or so , it 's been quite clear what being an atheist means .
if you do n't believe in a religion , there 's nothing wrong with picking and mixing , with taking out the best sides of religion .
`` and for me , atheism 2.0 is about both , as i say , a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying , `` '' what here could we use ? '' '' the secular world is full of holes . ''
i 'd like to kick off by looking at education .
now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
`` if you said to a modern liberal individualist , `` hey , how about a sermon ? '' ''
`` i 'm an independent , individual person . '' '' what 's the difference between a sermon and our modern , secular mode of delivery , the lecture ? ''
and i think we need to get back to that sermon tradition .
otherwise our minds are like sieves .
we should all look at the moon a bit more often . we do n't .
so if you go to an african-american pentecostalist church in the american south and you listen to how they talk , my goodness , they talk well .
so for example , take the jewish idea of forgiveness .
our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another .
now art is something that in the secular world , we think very highly of . we think art is really , really important .
art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we 've neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas .
art should be didactic .
the catholic church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year according to the wall street journal .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
they are multinational , as i say , they are branded , they have a clear identity , so they do n't get lost in a busy world .
( applause ) chris anderson : now this is actually a courageous talk , because you 're kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters .
the universe is large and we are tiny , without the need for further religious superstructure .
`` it 's so sad that we constantly say , `` '' i do n't believe so i ca n't have community , so i 'm cut off from morality , so i ca n't go on a pilgrimage . '' '' one wants to say , `` '' nonsense . why not ? '' '' and that 's really the spirit of my talk . ''
atheism should n't cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
but probably most people in the community certainly do n't think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common .
it does n't need it .
if you 're in the communal industry , look at religion and do the communal bit .
those iconic images of the astronauts bouncing on the moon obscure the alcoholism and depression on earth .
and not just in marriage .
and that is the fact that space itself is expanding .
that 's what the expansion of the universe or space means .
now , what stephen hawking mentioned , as well , is that after the big bang , space expanded at a very rapid rate .
one or both , who knows ? or it could be something completely different .
so a crystal that will ring if that happens .
now imagine a little brit somewhere that was n't cold and damp like home .
it 's enabling us to get fresh , new images and tell brand new stories .
the cloud lifted , the wind was still , and even the bear showed up .
now , when i heard about one animal , i knew we had to get it for my next series , untamed americas , for national geographic .
but just looking up with the naked eye , you really do n't need one .
thordis elva : i was 16 and in love for the first time .
their skirt was too short , their smile was too wide , their breath smelled of alcohol .
deep down , i knew i 'd done something immeasurably wrong .
my era of shame was over .
and yet , it did n't bring about closure for me .
ts : iceland and australia are geographically like this .
te : wanting to take revenge is a very human emotion — instinctual , even .
i thought i 'd buckle under the weight of responsibility .
instead , i was offered to really own what i did , and found that it did n't possess the entirety of who i am .
te : what we did is not a formula that we 're prescribing for others .
nobody has the right to tell anyone else how to handle their deepest pain or their greatest error .
but it 's about time that we stop treating sexual violence as a women 's issue .
i take a piece of paper , i visualize my story , sometimes i sketch , sometimes i do n't .
and as my image is already inside the paper , i just have to remove what 's not from that story .
( applause ) i chose papercutting because paper is cheap , it 's light , and you can use it in a lot of different ways .
but to me , they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story .
( laughter ) but it 's much more connected to the web . ( laughter )
and one ancient form of the book is scrolls .
`` i have some stories that are humorous , like `` '' dead beats . '' '' ( laughter ) other ones are historical . ''
`` `` modicity . '' ''
`` `` a web of time . '' ''
`` `` daily battles . '' ''
`` `` felicity . '' ''
`` the result is `` '' hells and heavens . '' '' it 's two panels 13 ft . high . ''
you have sweatshops in hells .
and then you have all those individual stories where sometimes we even have the same action , and the result puts you in hells or in heavens .
they are more our social identities .
`` it 's called `` '' fashion statement , '' '' and there are quotes about fashion , so you can read it , and also , because the definition of artist book is very generous . ''
you take them for a walk .
`` i called it `` '' working in the same direction . '' '' but i added weathervanes on both sides to show that they cover all directions . ''
with public art , i could also make cut glass .
so i started in the center with the acorn for the ohlone indian civilization .
i also planted the bibliotree .
you can also have function and form with public art .
and in 2009 , i was asked to make a poster to be placed in the subway cars in new york city for a year .
they have a lot of scenarios .
and i did n't know exactly why i had it , but it was so vivid .
now , i was n't horrified at me , because i 'm kind of used to myself .
put that on the job description .
because there is no way you can deliver victory without optimism .
let 's understand it as courage , hope , trust , solidarity , the fundamental belief that we humans can come together and can help each other to better the fate of mankind .
so i wrapped the door handle .
so at this point i 'm smitten .
and we 're no exception , our generation .
they come in a bewildering variety of different kinds .
extraordinary precision .
but they also compete after mating with their sperm .
well , what difference does this make ?
these are movies . they 're fiction .
what happened next was remarkable , and it 's where our cylinder enters the story .
all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home , and they 'll take with them their gods .
as you all know , that return from exile , the second temple , reshaped judaism .
the fact that this decree is in babylonian says one thing .
it left a dream of the middle east as a unit , and a unit where people of different faiths could live together .
the greek invasions ended that .
and throughout european culture afterward , cyrus remained the model .
`` `` marduk , we hold , called cyrus by his name . '' ''
the hebrew writers in the old testament , you will not be surprised to learn , take a rather different view of this .
and so in isaiah , we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this , not to marduk but to the lord god of israel — the lord god of israel who also called cyrus by name , also takes cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people .
and so the shah invents an iranian history , or a return to iranian history , that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the cyrus cylinder .
and it 's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means , what cyrus means , but above all , cyrus as articulated through this cylinder — cyrus as the defender of the homeland , the champion , of course , of iranian identity and of the iranian peoples , tolerant of all faiths .
and in the current iran , zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed places in the iranian parliament , something to be very , very proud of .
is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed ?
it certainly says far more about real freedoms than magna carta .
thank you .
( applause )
you live on a small farm in the philippines .
two weeks later , you 'd hear back the results .
two weeks may be just enough time for infection to spread and take away your way of life .
the genetic instructions encoded in dna inform how our bodies develop , grow , function .
your genetic information is strung into a long and twisted molecule , the dna double helix , that has over three billion letters , beginning to end .
these dna machines are wonderful .
am i of irish descent ?
personal dna machines are now aboard the international space station , where they can help monitor living conditions and protect the lives of astronauts .
this is not a family made of phd scientists .
last time i called them , they were checking out homegrown produce from the backyard garden .
they were testing tomatoes that they had picked , taking the flesh of their skin , putting it in a test tube , mixing it with chemicals to extract dna and then using their home dna copier to test those tomatoes for genetically engineered traits .
you could copy , paste and analyze dna and extract meaningful information from it .
so this is where people went astray again .
when i look back now on that first summer in rome and i see how much has changed over the past six years , it is an absolute transformation .
how much ?
you have 30 possible foods , and you have to pick five of them .
there 's important insights just locked away in company data .
further , companies that are engaging in data philanthropy , they 're finding new insights locked away in their data .
so i 'm going to show you what i believe is the current state of manufacturing , and then compare that to some natural systems .
but on the other side , if you look at the natural systems , we have proteins that have two million types , can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds , or dna with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour .
and they can repair themselves for longevity .
and we need to decode that into simple sequences — basically the dna of how our buildings work .
so i 'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and i at mit are working on to achieve this self-assembling future .
they 're embedded with mechanical electrical devices , sensors .
you decode what you want to fold up into , into a sequence of angles — so negative 120 , negative 120 , 0 , 0 , 120 , negative 120 — something like that ; so a sequence of angles , or turns , and you send that sequence through the string .
it basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts .
the other one is from the previous brick that was placed .
and then it gives you an output in 3d space .
so it 's exciting potential for this .
so i think these projects i 've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future , if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world .
but after four years the grim truth seeps out .
and we end up in hong ngu on the vietnamese side .
they made clear that a woman must not do a man 's job .
the perception of women 's life in gaza is passive .
thank you .
so i start to think a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this .
we were trying to ski from this group of islands up here , severnaya zemlya , to the north pole .
this is probably why i did n't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip .
the next question is , how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40 ?
we call this the global village construction set .
the world presented me with options , and i took them .
i realized that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that i needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just did n't exist yet .
thank you .
but anyway , take a look at its pollen .
and they go back and forth for a while .
`` `` '' i just got out of the hospital . ''
so we can be better , and the world can be better .
`` we know that if you text in the words `` '' mg '' '' and `` '' rubber band , '' '' there 's a 99 percent match for substance abuse . ''
`` and we know that if you text in `` '' sex , '' '' `` '' oral '' '' and `` '' mormon , '' '' you 're questioning if you 're gay . ''
i do n't think of myself as a mental health activist .
i get really excited about this data , i 'm a little nerdy .
i 'm here today to share with you an extraordinary journey - extraordinarily rewarding journey , actually - which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis .
i quit my job to focus on the real world problem : landmines .
actually , there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they 're needed to produce , which is mainly in the developing world .
there 's a target somewhere here .
maybe one slight difference : we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog .
this is our team in mozambique : one tanzanian trainer , who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows .
we have a demonstration site in mozambique .
but let me bring you to a very different problem .
and if , however , you are detected very early , diagnosed early , treatment can start , and even in hiv-positives , it makes sense .
so how does it work ?
this is a positive sample .
i just want to briefly highlight , the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in dar es salaam on a population of 500,000 people , where 15,000 reported to get a test done .
and by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent .
( applause )
( laughter ) but there 's a great difference between an escalope and my wife , for instance .
whereas my wife , she calls me the star of her life .
( laughter ) therefore , only another desiring conscience can conceive me as a desirable being .
hence the eternal problem of love : how to become and remain desirable ?
`` how many people are going to love me ? '' '' and how does he respond to this anxiety ? ''
nothing could be less materialistic , or more sentimental , than a teenager buying brand new jeans and tearing them at the knees , because he wants to please jennifer .
in light of this observation on contemporary love , how can we think of love in the years to come ?
but such a future does n't have to be .
( laughter ) ( applause ) we are all useless .
and there 's a lot of them that i actually ca n't show you on this chart .
and yet , only a hundred years later , three quarters of us get cremated .
as a shinnecock indian , i was raised to know this .
there were no clouds in the sky .
that 's part of you up there .
`` that 's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that feeds the plants that feeds the animals . '' '' in my continued exploration of subjects in nature that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life , i started storm chasing in 2008 after my daughter said , `` '' mom , you should do that . '' '' and so three days later , driving very fast , i found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell , capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes , although only two percent actually do . ''
there 's a warm , moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth , the wheat , the grass , the charged particles .
( applause )
sp : i agree with the president .
one percent does n't sound like a lot , but it would cause one hell of an ice age here .
this is rocket science , but it 's not hard rocket science .
everything that we need to make an atmosphere on mars , and to make a livable planet on mars , is probably there .
in 1918 , we had a flu epidemic in the united states that killed 20 million people .
we got ta fix that . we got ta outlaw that right away .
this is a chart that dr. clark chapman at the southwest research institute presented to congress a few years ago .
we fought together , we lived together .
and he 's been a pretty good general .
the students were just scared : scared to sit in rows in fear that something would happen ; scared because they were often teased in the cafeteria for eating free food .
we used two dumpsters per day .
i grew up poor in north philadelphia too .
i know what it feels like to wonder if there 's ever going to be any way out of poverty .
on the path that american children travel to adulthood , two institutions oversee the journey .
do n't they deserve to be in prison ?
living with a physical disability is n't easy anywhere in the world , but if you live in a country like the united states , there 's certain appurtenances available to you that do make life easier .
but in the developing world , things are quite different .
now the big , important point here is that the person is the complex machine in this system .
just like he could in a normal wheelchair .
the first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user-centered design focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries .
and the final point i want to make is that i think this project worked well because we engaged all the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from inception of an idea through innovation , validation , commercialization and dissemination , and that cycle has to start and end with end users .
the next day i went to my shop .
in 2013 , if you 're concerned about a depression diagnosis , you go to your doctor , and what do you get ?
seymour recruited me to caltech in the late 1980s .
in the '40s , costa ricans were given free education and free health care .
also , if you take a country like ours , the gdp per capita is around 11,000 dollars , depending on how you measure it .
so the question is , what is the next big idea for this generation ?
we want cities for people where we can walk and we can use bikes .
`` `` limpia '' means `` clean , '' because we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens . ''
because at the end of the day , what we have to show is that development with renewable energy is good for the people , for costa ricans that are alive today and especially for those who have n't been born .
this is our national museum today .
we started a new life without an army in this place , and here is where our abolition of fossil fuels will be announced one day .
we had the early energy-efficient light bulbs that took five minutes to warm up and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color .
now we have lights that produce light and a little bit of heat on the side .
you save 85 percent of the electricity with an led that you would have done in an old incandescent .
you 'll change your smartphone seven or eight times , probably more if you 're in this audience .
so leds are fantastic .
we decided , over the next two years , we will ban the halogens and the cfls ourselves .
you 've got illegal logging and deforestation still on a very large scale , or you can have fantastic , responsible forestry that we can be proud of .
now together , through our supply chain , with partners , we 've managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry .
so be decisive on these issues .
so why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind ?
by 2020 , we 'll produce more renewable energy than the energy we consume as a business .
every business can do things like this .
but then we 've got to look beyond our operations , and i think everybody would agree that now business has to take full responsibility for the impacts of your supply chain .
if you 're not measuring things , you do n't care and you do n't know .
is n't it about time that businesses were led equally by men and women ?
and we do not want to wait another hundred years .
on having really good sustainability strategies , there are companies like nike , patagonia , timberland , marks & spencer .
and together , we can help create a sustainable world , and , if we get it right , we can make sustainability affordable for the many people , not a luxury for the few .
thank you .
big scream for emma everybody .
thailand , 64 percent .
chad , 2 percent .
it was an amazing feeling .
and so now , bill and i have three .
the surprising thing to me , as i learned this history , was that it spread not along socioeconomic lines but around cultural lines .
this is a very powerful idea .
it means that parents have the ability to affect the future , not just accept it as it is .
it took so long back then because the contraceptives were n't that good .
i think , as we go through this history , it 's important to pause for a moment and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue .
now , indian women were really smart in this situation .
in that same slum in nairobi , i met a young businesswoman , and she was making backpacks out of her home .
`` we 're going to peak at nine or 10 billion . and that 's it . '' '' are they wrong ? ''
and you can be secure even if you do n't feel it .
now people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs .
2010 new york , not so much .
the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar .
one example would be , people fear kidnapping by strangers when the data supports kidnapping by relatives is much more common .
this works until you invent newspapers .
so one half , one quarter , one fifth — we 're good at that .
one in a million , one in a billion — they 're both almost never .
and there are two ways to do this .
well a couple of things : understanding of the security , of the risks , the threats , the countermeasures , how they work .
enough real world examples helps .
not enough examples .
it does n't change ; it 's real .
models can come from industry .
think of cancer , of bird flu , swine flu , sars .
models are not static .
this is not uncommon .
an example , a great example , is the risk of smoking .
compare that to the airbag debate — probably about 30 years behind .
what we learn is that changing models is hard .
so it 's a very hard model to accept .
september 11th created a security model in a lot of people 's heads .
i mean , this works as long as it 's to correct others .
i flew here yesterday .
now when these go out of whack , you have two options .
we live in a technological world ; reality changes all the time .
1982 — i do n't know if people will remember this — there was a short epidemic of tylenol poisonings in the united states .
there was n't any real risk , but people were scared .
it 's important that , if our feelings match reality , we make better security trade-offs .
i met an incredible girl who became my lifelong best friend , and my associate in everything that i have done till now , my wife , lélia wanick salgado .
brazil radicalized very strongly .
i went to see a friend 's doctor in paris , told him that i was completely sick .
when we received this land , this land was as dead as i was .
i wished to photograph the other animals , to photograph the landscapes , to photograph us , but us from the beginning , the time we lived in equilibrium with nature .
well , this — ( applause ) — thank you . thank you very much .
but there is another part that we must together rebuild , to build our societies , our modern family of societies , we are at a point where we can not go back .
when you have trees , the root system holds the water .
i want to show you now , to finish , just a few pictures that for me are very important in that direction .
by an accident that happened to me , we went back , we built an ecosystem .
so we must be good at killing mosquitos .
well , the result has been very good .
think about that for a second .
`` they called it `` '' the instrument that plays itself . '' '' now , the instrument was basically a giant music box . ''
the organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions encoded by placing pins on a rotating cylinder .
if you wanted a new pattern for your fabric , you just programmed a new cylinder .
now , the cylinders were too expensive and time-consuming to make , but a half century later , another french inventor named jacquard hit upon the brilliant idea of using paper-punched cards instead of metal cylinders .
you 'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun .
it expands in winter and contracts in summer .
the so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , spilling out of the body here .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this tipping point .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxymoron .
so let 's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
we were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the european union .
for them , it would have been unimaginable that a whole country could go out of existence because of human-induced climate change .
i came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer , and i was n't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers .
there was an unprecedented flooding in the country , it covered about a third of the country , over 300 people were killed , and hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods .
but we 're on course for about four degrees .
so they must develop without emissions , and that is a different kind of problem .
this is an issue that requires complete human solidarity .
it would require great solidarity and support from other countries , and it would require the kind of imaginative idea that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air .
`` wangari said once , `` '' in the course of history , there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness , to reach a higher moral ground . '' '' and that 's what we have to do . ''
and most of those losses are because of things we know .
and so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health .
but i think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here .
it 's a 130-fold improvement , and that is 10 times further and faster than anything we 've ever achieved in industrial history .
that 's called the circular flow of the economy .
it does this in a couple of ways — chasing productivity , which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff .
it 's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty , continually chasing expanding consumer markets , consumer goods , new consumer goods .
but this — i just want to show you some data here .
they want to spend less and save more .
here 's another one — completely different one : why is it that we do n't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change , very , very simple things like buying energy-efficient appliances , putting in efficient lights , turning the lights off occasionally , insulating our homes ?
so is it that , though they make perfect economic sense , we do n't do them ?
and my , then , five year-old daughter was helping me in the way that five year-olds do .
you can hear the five-year-old mind working .
well psychology actually says there is a tension — a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors .
and perhaps even more interesting from our point of view , another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation .
we 've created systems , which systematically privilege , encourage , one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded .
investment has to be , in the new economy , protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends .
but actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing , different kinds of politics , and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently — absolutely vital .
( applause )
that 's how we improve .
so today i want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve .
well , unfortunately there 's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems .
we 're tied for 15th with iceland and poland .
they have weekly study groups , where teachers get together and talk about what 's working .
what would that system look like ?
and what we found is very exciting .
okay , so i would like you to please bring up your papers .
and i 'm able to learn a lot from it .
so it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection .
if you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions , you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions .
this would n't just make us a more successful country .
i hope you are too .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
so , who got more than five circles figured out ?
so , remember the sketching task we did at the beginning ?
but not anymore for some of us .
all we have to do is to bring these elements together and let nature take over .
we touch , feel and even taste it to identify what properties it lacks .
it goes against nature .
that 's the simple rule .
we plant the saplings close to each other .
as the forest grows we keep watering it — for the next two to three years , we water the forest .
you see the defibrillator . you see the equipment .
we were so scared and we just ran away .
he could have run from a block away .
i ran there by foot . i had no medical equipment .
i took off my yarmulke , because i had no medical equipment , and with a lot of pressure , i stopped his bleeding .
the second reason is because of our technology .
when i started this organization , i was 17 years old .
and i 'm actually starting it in india very soon with a friend who i met in harvard just a while back .
hatzalah actually started in brooklyn by a hasidic jew years before us in williamsburg , and now it 's all over the jewish community in new york , even australia and mexico and many other jewish communities .
but it could spread everywhere .
you even saw these volunteers in new york saving lives in the world trade center .
love letters , phone sex , racy polaroids .
does this sound familiar ?
think about having surgery .
right now , we just do n't have that many protections .
no ! no !
jennifer was embarrassed and humiliated , but instead of being compassionate , her classmates harassed her .
because the problem is not sexting , the issue is digital privacy .
in order to tell the individual human stories here , i felt that i needed to remove the dramatic visuals that had become so familiar and repetitive within the mainstream media .
they came day after day and they covered the square with millions of flowers .
they sacrifice material comforts in exchange for the space and the time to explore a creative interior , to dream , to read , to work on music , art and writing .
dr. ignaz semmelweis had discovered infectious disease .
he did it for two reasons .
we 'd known since the 1680s about bacteria .
also , you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around ?
so if you stop aging , all of you are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors .
i think he deserves a closer look .
first of all , i have a really hard time seeing him as a crackpot .
yeah , he started off life as a computer scientist , not a biologist , but he earned a phd in biology from cambridge , and he has published some very significant work on mitochondrial dna and a bunch of other stuff .
he believes , and he 's made a convincing case , that using viruses we can do gene therapy , fix that dna and rejuvenate our cells .
one more thing .
there are four times as many people alive today as einstein .
but actually the story is bigger .
eh : you came to la to break into hollywood , first in publicity , then in tv .
was your mother proud of you ?
but the fact that he was going to oklahoma in a plane , and he was going to bring me back a 10-gallon hat , just like ken maynard , my favorite cowboy wore .
`` i 'm crying , and this asshole says , `` '' you 're the man of the house now . '' '' and i think that was the moment i began to understand the foolishness of the human condition . ''
when my father was away , i was fooling with a crystal radio set that we had made together , and i caught a signal that turned out to be father coughlin .
tell us about him .
and lots of little parades .
`` and i 'd pick up a little white envelope reading , `` '' shya c. called at this address . '' '' and that 's the story i have told about my grandfather — eh : they wrote him back on the envelopes — nl : they wrote back . ''
the truth is a tear came down his eye .
now i 've gone through a whole lot of shit and come out on the other side , and i forgive my father — the best thing i — the worst thing i — the word i 'd like to use about him and think about him is — he was a rascal .
so you 're in good company .
but have there ever been any stories about the impact of your work that surprised you ?
he was talking about a simple thing that made a big — eh : impact on him ?
but — eh : so in addition to the long list i shared in the beginning , i should have also mentioned that you invented hip-hop .
( laughter ) nl : well ...
but even those of us who do manage to accomplish both of those , very rarely do we figure out how to do them together .
which we 're trying to save and it requires saving .
anything i may have accomplished is — my sister once asked me what she does about something that was going on in newington , connecticut .
i am convinced we 're all responsible for doing as much as i may have accomplished .
how old do you feel ?
ladies and gentlemen , the incomparable norman lear .
( applause ) nl : thank you . ( applause )
i do n't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room , but by any standard they have never been flourishing to a greater extent .
and , as you can see , there — something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses .
but here , there — one of the most famous literary english scholars of our time is the berkeley professor , judith butler .
by the way , this is one sentence — you can actually parse it .
people are staying away from elite art and criticism .
but it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors .
ok — two different bodies of research with a similar finding .
and that presents us with a choice .
