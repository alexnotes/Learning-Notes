we who are diplomats , we are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states .
you see the green is a traditional interstate conflict , the ones we used to read about .
the red is modern conflict , conflicts within states .
and the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries .
after 9/11 , either you were with us or against us .
it was black or white .
and groups are very often immediately label terrorists .
i happen to believe that libya was necessary and that military intervention in afghanistan was also necessary .
but still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict .
when i first came to afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister , i met the commander of isaf , the international troops .
we can only solve this through a political solution .
`` and it is not us who will solve it ; afghans have to solve it . '' '' but then they need a different political process than the one they were given in 2001 , 2002 . ''
`` prime minister rabin said when he engaged the oslo process , `` '' you do n't make peace with your friends , you make peace with your enemies . '' '' it 's hard , but it is necessary . ''
let me go one step further .
the arab spring is heading into fall and is moving into winter .
it will last for a long , long time .
social groups are taking to the streets .
because we never talk to the people in these countries .
`` if we talk to them , we may legitimize them . '' '' i think that is wrong . ''
and how can we tell the muslim brotherhood , as we should , that they must respect minority rights , if we do n't accept majority rights ?
so he engaged a political process of dialogue , not as a strategy of the weak , but as a strategy of the strong .
if we 're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts , if we 're going to understand these new groups which are coming from bottom-up , supported by technology , which is available to all , we diplomats can not be sitting back in the banquets believing that we are doing interstate relations .
we know from our personal experiences that it 's easy sometimes just to walk , and sometimes you may need to fight .
this is perhaps a first element of a change .
it is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy very different from the one we are practicing today as we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations , but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a broad mobilization .
it 's crucial to understand , i believe , because of technology and because of globalization , societies from bottom-up .
the diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication .
but the problem is that we are coming out of a decade where we had a fear of touching it .
our modern western societies are more complex than before , in this time of migration .
so there are many reasons , and for all of these reasons , this is time and this is why we must talk .

they want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful , to be healthy , and to have a successful life .
but i also see lots of poverty , and it 's quite jarring , both in the scale and the scope of it .
my first trip in india , i was in a person 's home where they had dirt floors , no running water , no electricity , and that 's really what i see all over the world .
in fact , when i travel to the developing world , coke feels ubiquitous .
and i think there are really three things we can take away from coca-cola .
they learn something , they put it back into the product , they put it back into the market .
`` they have a whole team called `` '' knowledge and insight . '' '' it 's a lot like other consumer companies . ''
so if you 're running namibia for coca-cola , and you have a 107 constituencies , you know where every can versus bottle of sprite , fanta or coke was sold , whether it was a corner store , a supermarket or a pushcart .
so if sales start to drop , then the person can identify the problem and address the issue .
in development , the evaluation comes at the very end of the project .
i 've sat in a lot of those meetings , and by then , it is way too late to use the data .
`` they said , `` '' you roll the ball , you hear some pins go down . ''
and so they took a bit of time to learn about that .
and in 2003 , the government of ethiopia started this new system in their own country .
in just five years , their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people .
now , think about how this can change people 's lives .
in ethiopia , there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program .
so what 's the next step for ethiopia ?
well , they 're already starting talk about this .
ultimately , coke 's success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a coca-cola .
`` coke 's global campaign slogan is `` '' open happiness . '' '' but they localize it . ''
and they do n't just guess what makes people happy ; they go to places like latin america and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life .
`` it does n't sound anything like `` '' wavin ' flag '' '' to me . ''
and i think we make a fundamental mistake — we make an assumption , that we think that , if people need something , we do n't have to make them want that .
but there 's a solution : you build a toilet .
people reuse it for a slab for their home .
well , you work with the community .
you start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that should n't be done in the village , and they agree to that .
and it works — look at these headlines .
take a look at this — this is a room full of young men and my husband , bill .
so let 's talk about what happens when this all comes together , when you tie the three things together .
and polio , i think , is one of the most powerful examples .
so if you look back to 1988 , there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year .
let me tell you the story of shriram , an 18 month boy in bihar , a northern state in india .
now it could have come from one of two places .
luckily , the genetic testing proved that , in fact , this strand came north , because , had it come from the south , it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission .
so many more people would have been affected .
so what 's the endgame ?
that 's how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading , and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands ; they can save lives .
the g8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years , but we 're starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations are n't willing to fund polio any longer .
so by next summer , we 're sighted to run out of money on polio .
and it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet .
and we are so close .
and let me show you .
this is actually a picture of the spectrum of the sun .
why is it that we study other animals instead of them studying us ?
when i became interested in these questions about 10 years ago , scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of .
this means that two brains of the same size , like these two , with a respectable 400 grams , should have similar numbers of neurons .
now , if neurons are the functional information processing units of the brain , then the owners of these two brains should have similar cognitive abilities .
but let 's play along .
so the largest brain around should also be the most cognitively able .
it seems quite vexing .
the human brain also seems special in the amount of energy that it uses .
now , you may have heard or read somewhere that we have 100 billion neurons , so 10 years ago , i asked my colleagues if they knew where this number came from .
it seems that nobody had actually ever counted the number of neurons in the human brain , or in any other brain for that matter .
it 's simple , it 's straightforward , and it 's really fast .
so we 've used that method to count neurons in dozens of different species so far , and it turns out that all brains are not made the same way .
we found that we have , on average , 86 billion neurons , 16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex , and if you consider that the cerebral cortex is the seat of functions like awareness and logical and abstract reasoning , and that 16 billion is the most neurons that any cortex has , i think this is the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
and all of you are primates .
i love to think that darwin would have really appreciated this .
and it turns out that both human and other brains cost about the same , an average of six calories per billion neurons per day .
last question , then : how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons , and in particular , if great apes are larger than we are , why do n't they have a larger brain than we do , with more neurons ?
when we realized how much expensive it is to have a lot of neurons in the brain , i figured , maybe there 's a simple reason .
nine hours of feeding per day seems to be the practical limit for a primate .
with our 86 billion neurons and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass , we should have to spend over nine hours per day every single day feeding , which is just not feasible .
well , if our brain costs just as much energy as it should , and if we ca n't spend every waking hour of the day feeding , then the only alternative , really , is to somehow get more energy out of the same foods .
to cook is to use fire to pre-digest foods outside of your body .
so i think this explains why the human brain grew to become so large so fast in evolution , all of the while remaining just a primate brain .
so what once was a solution now became the problem , and ironically , we look for the solution in raw food .
i still barely understand what most scientists are talking about .
dance really can make science easier to understand .
but do n't take my word for it .
of course , that 's just the time we 're losing sitting through presentations .
one certainly ca n't argue with those numbers .
we now know the brain circuitry of imagination , of long-term planning .
so we 're seeing there 's a real extension of middle age .
and that 's what i 'm now contributing to this .
i want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that , by far , most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light .
we can stand on the earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes .
we see light reflected off the moon .
i 'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself , because space can wobble like a drum .
so in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song , which i 'd like to play for you — some of our predictions for what that song will be like .
but they wo n't come to us directly through light .
now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to albert einstein — to whom we owe so much .
it was einstein 's great general theory of relativity .
and he was reading einstein 's recently published general theory of relativity , and he was thrilled by this theory .
light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be , and all that would be left would be a shadow .
and he took schwarzschild 's idea to the prussian academy of sciences the next week .
it 's actually not massive enough .
this crushed black hole actually would fit inside manhattan , more or less .
we would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the milky way galaxy and its luminous dust lanes .
but even though the black hole is dark from the outside , it 's not dark on the inside , because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us .
it would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel , but it 's a total death experience .
maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes — each one 10 times the mass of the sun .
and they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light .
it took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem .
and if you can see — it 's kind of faint — but if you can see the red waves emanating out , those are the gravitational waves .
this is from my group — a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
and we can predict what the sound will be .
now i 've never heard it that loud — it 's actually more dramatic .
at home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
this is another sound from my group .
( laughter ) want to get away from the sound .
in this case , they 're both wobbling quite a lot .
now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging — that it chirps up at the end .
now that 's our prediction for what we 'll see .
but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
in this hubble image , we see two galaxies .
and each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core .
and it 's not just black holes , but it 's also any big disturbance in the universe — and the biggest of them all is the big bang .
`` when that expression was coined , it was derisive — like , `` '' oh , who would believe in a big bang ? '' '' but now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang . ''
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habitable planet .
that song has been ringing through space for all that time .
we were n't even here .
it 's like hurry , build your instruments .
it 's literally the definition of noise .
i mean , in the spirit of rising to ted 's challenge to reignite wonder , we can ask questions , at least for this last minute , that honestly might evade us forever .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multiverse , in some other patch of that multiverse , are there creatures ?
here 's my multiverse creatures .
are there other creatures in the multiverse , wondering about us and wondering about their own origins ?
and if they are , i can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there .
so before going to law school in china i bought a banjo , i threw it in my little red truck and i traveled down through appalachia and i learned a bunch of old american songs , and i ended up in kentucky at the international bluegrass music association convention .
and after a few months i was writing songs .
and i 've played thousands of shows .
and then i go to china and i stand on a stage at a university and i bust out into a song in chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight at this girl with the hair and the instrument , and she 's singing their music .
`` `` '' big sister wong , can i sing you a song that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake ? '' '' and i sat down , she sat on my lap . ''
and the warmth of her body and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks , and i started to cry .
we all die . we all get old . we all get sick . people leave us .
in reality , it does not really make you safer .
they then go on to create an event , and beyond that , a foundation to support that .
not so with movember . movember started in a very traditional australian way . it was on a sunday afternoon .
parents would shuffle kids away from us . ( laughter ) but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey , and it was a real journey .
and i started to research that topic , and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it .
and that eloquently describes the challenge , changing your appearance for the 30 days , and also the outcome that we 're trying to achieve : getting men engaged in their health , having them have a better understanding about the health risks that they face .
so with that model , i then cold-called the ceo of the prostate cancer foundation .
so we 'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars worth of debt . so if movember 2006 did n't happen , the four founders , well , we would 've been broke , we would 've been homeless , sitting on the street with mustaches . ( laughter ) but we thought , you know what , if that 's the worst thing that happens , so what ?
`` but he said , `` '' we will partner with you , but we 're not going to invest in it . you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work . '' '' so what we did was , we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country , the u.s , and the u.k. , and we did that because we knew , if this was successful , we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in australia . and that money fuels research , and that research will get us to a cure . ''
but what i 'm really pleased to say is , in 2010 , movember became a truly global movement .
`` and he goes , `` '' listen , i know it 's about men 's health , i know it 's about prostate cancer , but this is for breast cancer . '' '' and i said , `` '' okay , that 's interesting . '' '' and he goes , `` '' last year , my mom passed away from breast cancer in sri lanka , because we could n't afford proper treatment for her , '' '' and he said , `` '' this mustache is my tribute to my mom . '' '' and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi , and i did n't tell him who i was , because i did n't think it was appropriate , and i just shook his hand and i said , `` '' thank you so much . ''
`` of 26 , for the first time ever , i had a conversation with my dad one on one about men 's health . i had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer , and i learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and i was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease , and he did n't know that , and he had n't been getting screened for it . '' '' so now , that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer . ''
we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries .
so what we did was , we created a global action plan , and we 're taking 10 percent of what 's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund , and we 've got the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world that look after that fund , and they come together each year and identify the number one priority , and that , last year , was getting a better screening test .
thank you , thank you .
we are always trying to decode our world .
so gwen , i 'm going to hand you this envelope .
let 's take a closer look .
thank you .
what was the most difficult job you ever did ?
was it working in the sun ?
coral reefs are security guards .
so let 's change that .
now , there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet , maybe 1,000 .
you ca n't run around in the dark .
`` `` you ca n't sue someone for calling them a cunt . '' ''
`` `` '' i wish ashley judd would die a horrible death . ''
i 've tried engaging people .
and my expressing it does not pornography make .
enough excuses .
you can do something , or you can do nothing .
believe her .
aj : god does good work .
and then we went to teachers .
even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment — on the side of the road or next to a river .
biological yield is really important .
you stop by a wall , and start painting on that wall .
and it looks like a bombed-out landscape , but it is n't .
in fact , it 's likely happening right now as we speak .
why , when i die , should they not have their turn with me ?
we 'll start with a dead body .
families can come here ; they can luxuriate in nature ; they can even plant a tree or a shrub , though only native plants to the area are allowed .
the soil , let me tell you , has missed us .
will changing the way we bury our dead solve climate change ?
( applause )
and seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
ca : that was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
fold .
it was the coldest i 've ever been .
i ca n't stop shaking .
i mean , to me , this was it . life could not get any better .
but to me , that trip was a testament to the wildness i traded for those touristy beaches .
so this is the place where some of the largest , the most violent storms in the world send huge waves smashing into the coastline .
and then the temperature began to drop .
you see , we were all outside when the contamination came down .
and you 're nice . you say hi .
and you do n't have sex .
that 's true even amongst peers .
today , i 'd like to show you something which came out of these collaborations .
come on .
forgot this .
( music ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) ( music ) uh oh . ( music )
all right . let 's try this .
you heard her , go ahead .
i could afford that .
so this animal here has got a brain about the size of a grain of rice , and yet it can do things that you and i could n't possibly entertain the idea of doing .
and it seems appropriate to start at the end , because this is a waste product that comes out of other animals , but it still contains nutrients and there are sufficient nutrients in there for dung beetles basically to make a living , and so dung beetles eat dung , and their larvae are also dung-feeders .
so the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
and most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort .
so this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball .
you can see it 's a male because he 's got a little hair on the back of his legs there , and he 's clearly very pleased about what he 's sitting on there .
and so valuable resources have to be looked after and guarded in a particular way , and we think the reason they roll the balls away is because of this , because of the competition that is involved in getting hold of that dung .
so what you 've got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the african veld .
this is africa . it 's hot .
so watch this beetle , and there 's two things that i would like you to be aware of .
so clearly this animal knows where it 's going and it knows where it wants to go , and that 's a very , very important thing , because if you think about it , you 're at the dung pile , you 've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else , and the quickest way to do it is in a straight line .
what are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement ? and the most obvious one is to look at the sky , and so we thought , now what could they be looking at in the sky ?
and the obvious thing to look at is the sun .
what we 're going to do now is shade the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position .
so obviously beetles can see polarized light .
but how do they pick up those celestial cues ?
that was what was of interest to us next .
and in this experiment here , what we did was we forced them into a channel , and you can see he was n't particularly forced into this particular channel , and we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees until this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction that it wanted to go in , in the first place .
he knows exactly what the problem is , and he knows exactly how to deal with it , and the dance is this transition behavior that allows them to reorientate themselves .
now we thought , now what could be going on here ?
and we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior .
and what 's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool .
watch how often the beetle dances .
so the ball leaves a little thermal shadow , and the beetle climbs on top of the ball and wipes its face , and all the time it 's trying to cool itself down , we think , and avoid the hot sand that it 's walking across .
and what we did then was put little boots on these legs , because this was a way to test if the legs were involved in sensing the temperature of the soil .
this is a different species in the same genus but exactly the same foraging behavior .
so watch this individual here , and what he 's trying to do is set up a nest .
and by and large , you 'll see that the homeward path is far more direct than the outward path .
so we know now that this animal uses path integration to find its way around , and the callous experimenter leads it top left and leaves it . ( laughter ) so what we 're looking at here are a group of animals that use a compass , and they use the sun as a compass to find their way around , and they have some sort of system for measuring that distance , and we know that these species here actually count the steps . that 's what they use as an odometer , a step-counting system , to find their way back home .
and while these two cities have the same population , san diego has grown six times larger than tijuana in the last decades , immediately thrusting us to confront the tensions and conflicts between sprawl and density , which are at the center of today 's discussion about environmental sustainability .
what do i mean by the informal in this case ?
but not only houses , also small debris from one city , from san diego , to tijuana .
they found out that they had been lucky because they had not begun to dig under caltrans territoy .
caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway , so it would have been very difficult to negotiate with them .
they came to the city attorney 's office .
for me as an architect , it has become a fundamental narrative , because it begins to teach me that this micro-community not only designed another category of public space but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols that were necessary to be inscribed in that space for its long-term sustainability .
thank you .
( applause )
i would like to share with you a new model of higher education , a model that , once expanded , can enhance the collective intelligence of millions of creative and motivated individuals that otherwise would be left behind .
pick up a place and focus on it .
you will find humans chasing higher education .
patrick .
during the civil war , he and his family were forced to flee to nigeria .
late at night , after work , he surfed the net looking for ways to study .
but debbie does n't have the savings for higher education .
she ca n't pay the tuition .
he 's a big believer in education .
in large parts of the world , higher education is unattainable for an average citizen .
this is probably the biggest problem facing our society .
and here comes the third reason : unesco stated that in 2025 , 100 million students will be deprived from higher education simply because there will not be enough seats to accommodate them , to meet the demand .
patrick , debbie and wael are only three examples out of the 1,700 accepted students from 143 countries .
there are no limits of seats in virtual university .
actually , nobody needs to stand at the back of the lecture hall .
we use this sound pedagogical model to encourage our students from all over the world to interact and study together and also to reduce the time our professors need to labor over class assignments .
this way , we open our students ' minds , we develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures .
we do n't use audio . we do n't use video .
we are tuition-free .
today , it is a reality .
thank you .
( applause )
this is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet .
and my gateway into this world of biofluorescence begins with corals .
it 's a really shy , reclusive eel that we know almost nothing about .
but these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights , and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue .
but this is all beautiful to see .
i was like , this is gorgeous .
there 's no biofluorescent marine life down there , below 1,000 meters — almost nothing , it 's just darkness .
mark twain summed up what i take to be one of the fundamental problems of cognitive science with a single witticism .
generalizing from small samples of data is the bread and butter of science .
let 's find out .
it 's plausibly a random sample from this population .
see this one ?
maybe only the blue balls squeak .
let 's see what the baby does .
let me show you the experimental results .
let me show you another example now , this time about a problem of causal reasoning .
now , when the baby gets the toy , he 's going to have a choice .
so let 's see what the baby does .
human minds think of altogether new ideas .
the babies really are that genius .
and no , i 'm not a meter maid , and i 'm not an undertaker .
so i go on television .
it 's sort of like thanksgiving with your conservative uncle on steroids , with a live television audience of millions .
and that 's just on air .
i was called an idiot , a traitor , a scourge , a cunt , and an ugly man , and that was just in one email .
i care about two things .
or do you really want to hurt me personally ?
and what i 've realized is that political persuasion does n't begin with ideas or facts or data .
but liberals on my side , we can be self-righteous , we can be condescending , we can be dismissive of anyone who does n't agree with us .
i 'm not saying it 's easy .
an average of , like , 5.6 times per day i have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail with a flurry of vile profanities .
i 'm a believer .
but my subject is national security .
and let me take you back 100 years to 1912 .
a hundred years ago we were looking at coal , of course , and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil .
so from here , it 's pretty clear to me , we would prefer to have cleaner , cheaper , domestic , ours — and we have that , we have that — which is natural gas .
so here you are , that the cost of all this to the world is 89 million barrels of oil , give or take a few barrels , every day .
now when you look at where is the transfer of wealth , you can see here that we have the arrows going into the mid-east and away from us .
i know the response to this .
there are 12 .
one is under construction by the chinese and the other 11 belong to us .
do we have a corner on the market ?
that 's not sustainable .
the chinese have a little bit better plan — or they have a plan ; we have no plan .
we do n't even realize the resources that we have available to us .
if you take the last 10 years and bring forward , you 've transferred to opec a trillion dollars .
that 's not sustainable either .
but the days of cheap oil are over .
`` now i had people in washington last week told me , he said , `` '' the saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel . ''
and the opec nations are the ones that price the oil .
so where are we headed from here ?
we 're headed to natural gas .
it 's 130 octane fuel .
and it does not require a refinery .
it comes out of the ground at 130 octane .
it 's going to be very simple for us to use .
it 's for power generation , transportation , it 's peaking fuel , it 's all those .
look at the bar on the left . it 's 24 trillion .
so i have tried to target on where we use the natural gas .
there are eight million of them .
so there 's nothing going on that impresses me in washington on that plan , other than i 'm trying to focus on that eight million 18-wheelers .
you can not do a wind deal under six dollars an mcf .
tbp : that 's what happened .
we are overwhelmed with natural gas .
now i do own stocks .
i 'm not a big natural gas producer .
do n't i wish .
but i also am in the fueling business .
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
you 've made the money you need .
the government is not successful on these things .
they just are n't , it 's a bad deal .
but that only blew out 500 million .
i think it 's closer to a billion .
( laughter ) and number two , do not build a reformer on the ocean .
move them inland and on very stable ground and build the reformers .
tbp : fracking ? what is fracking ?
the first frack job was in '47 .
i 've fracked over 3,000 wells in my life .
never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else .
why ? air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel .
i know what you 're telling me , and i 'm not disagreeing with you .
how in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point ?
( laughter ) ca : all right , so it 's the bridge fuel .
what is at the other end of that bridge is for this audience to figure out .
yeah , sure , i 'm game for it .
because , again , i 'm trying to get energy solved for america .
i think there 's a lot of people who will want to engage with you .
growing up in taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of chinese characters .
i started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning chinese might be useful .
since the age of five , i started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence .
i learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
you get a mouth .
this is a person going for a walk .
person .
`` if the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was yelling frantically , `` '' help ! i 'm on fire ! '' '' — this symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame , but i like to think that way . whichever works for you . ''
the symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
two fires together , i get really hot .
three fires together , that 's a lot of flames .
set the fire underneath the two trees , it 's burning .
a door . put a plank inside the door , it 's a door bolt .
for example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . it 's a volcano .
we know japan is the land of the rising sun .
a japanese person .
a mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
so accidental discovery is not uncommon in science , but it requires more than just a happy accident .
you have to be able to recognize it for discovery to occur .
and mental set is another thing . right ?
one , they have terrible side effects .
so we developed drugs to more specifically focus on serotonin , the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , so the ssris , the most famous of which is prozac .
and that was 30 years ago , and since then we have mostly just worked on optimizing those drugs .
what if it 's not even the key part of it ?
and we also give it another mouse in a pencil cup that it can decide to interact with .
but it is actually kind of similar to what you see in immune vaccines .
so in immune vaccines , you 'll get your shots , and then weeks , months , years later , when you 're actually exposed to bacteria , it 's not the vaccine in your body that protects you .
we tried prozac as well , and that had no effect .
as i mentioned before , repurposing can be challenging because of our prior biases .
it 's actually the drug of choice in a lot of developing nations , because it does n't affect breathing .
it is on the world health organization list of most essential medicines .
it is possible that 20 , 50 , 100 years from now , we will look back now at depression and ptsd the way we look back at tuberculosis sanitoriums as a thing of the past .
in 2009 , i lost someone i loved very much .
do n't they just pop into your head ?
why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art ?
a kid who has just started to lie is taking the first step as a storyteller .
but kids do n't mind .
kids do n't do it because someone told them to .
it 's a bit mischievous , actually .
contemporary art , i later discovered , is n't explained by a lame story like mine .
`` he stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it `` '' bull 's head . '' '' sounds convincing , right ? ''
so we start to envy them .
so what should we do now ?
( applause )
most of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world .
this is the work i do .
most people associate this type of action with gandhi and martin luther king .
but people have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years .
there are a variety of methods that can be used to do this .
and protest is only one .
let me give you a recent example .
so they organized a general strike , in which people throughout the country refused to work .
( laughter ) activists around the world are getting better at grabbing headlines , but these isolated actions do very little if they 're not part of a larger strategy .
violence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned in the same way that bows and arrows were , because we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective .
for the brands , sneakerheads are a very important demographic .
i have about 250 pairs , but trust me , i am small-time .
but i learned , because i had to , and i liked it .
now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases .
and that 's because sneakers are an investment opportunity where none other exists .
let me walk you through some numbers .
it 's marketing .
so nike sets the rules .
can you imagine if that 's how stocks were bought ?
the realest word we have .
because remember , words are not real .
they do n't have meaning . we do .
just see the contrast .
and one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling .
that you see , the horizontal axis is where you place your country .
but the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures .
this is one of those alternatives .
and then they also exhibit curiosity .
`` `` i feel like i 'm in this fog of depression that i ca n't get out of . '' ''
another technique is directly questioning people .
you know , orion facing the roaring bull .
what are the great stories of today ?
when you 're faced with brutality , whether it 's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence — or , on the streets of syria today , facing tanks and shrapnel , what 's the most effective thing to do ?
you need training . i 'll help you .
`` but just unpack your suitcase . '' '' and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20s . ''
but i realized that what i really needed to know i could n't get from training courses .
and what i 've discovered since is this : bullies use violence in three ways .
that means i need to know how i tick , when i collapse , where my formidable points are , where my weaker points are .
what will i stand up for ?
she was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of rangoon .
so what about our fear ?
my fear grows fat on the energy i feed it .
and i learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy-makers .
because at the beginning i was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that i just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong .
in order to develop a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger .
and that 's the basis on which we have to talk with them .
so that 's the third one , anger .
and it brings me to the crux of what 's going on , or what i perceive as going on , in the world today , which is that last century was top-down power .
it was still governments telling people what to do .
this century there 's a shift .
it 's people joining up with people , as bundy just said , miles away to bring about change .
so peace direct gets behind them to do that .
and they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this .
and i think that the u.s. military is finally beginning to get this .
so the training of the troops has to change .
but there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from , and that 's a brilliant u.s. lieutenant colonel called chris hughes .
`` and chris hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head , pointing at the ground , and he said , `` '' kneel . '' '' and these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor , wobbled to the ground . ''
in the moment , that 's what he did .
a lot of it is due to a book written by an 80-year-old man in boston , gene sharp .
we 're using the kind of skills that i 've outlined : inner power — the development of inner power — through self-knowledge , recognizing and working with our fear , using anger as a fuel , cooperating with others , banding together with others , courage , and most importantly , commitment to active non-violence .
we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known .
and we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve .
all of these diseases have a strong evolutionary component that directly relates to the fact that we live today in a very different environment than the ones in which our bodies evolved .
and first of all , what do we even study ?
and in a typical dentistry visit , you may have about 15 to 30 milligrams removed .
we find it in every population around the world at all time periods going back tens of thousands of years .
and so previous studies had only focused on microscopy .
they 'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope , and what they had found was things like pollen and plant starches , and they 'd found muscle cells from animal meats and bacteria .
so it gives us virtual access to the lungs , which is where many important diseases reside .
and so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that , from the skeleton alone , has long decomposed .
so what started out as an idea , is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease , right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens .
and from this information we can learn about how pathogens evolve and also why they continue to make us sick .
and i hope i have convinced you of the value of dental calculus .
we did n't know we could pull it off ; it was very controversial .
during the first three years of life , the brain grows to its full size , with most of that growth taking place in the first six months . the brain develops in response to experience and to stimulation .
every time a young baby learns something new — to focus its eyes , to mimic a movement or a facial expression , to pick something up , to form a word or to sit up — new synaptic connections are being built in the brain .
new parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning .
they are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children 's cleverness .
this forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent provides the building blocks for physical , social , language , cognitive and psychomotor development .
and it 's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
i was asked to help the director of a large institution to help prevent the separation of children from their families .
the newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours , but their demands were not met , and so eventually they learned not to bother . within a few days , they were listless , lethargic , and staring into space like all the others .
at 8 , their nappies must be changed , so a staff member may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children .
the child 's daily contact with another human being is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing , and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling , the walls or the bars of their cots .
since my first visit to ceausescu 's institution , i 've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries , from the czech republic to sudan .
there 's rarely enough to eat . they are often hungry .
if we spend less on these children but on the right services , we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs .
across europe , a movement is growing to shift the focus and transfer the resources from large institutions that provide poor quality care to community-based services that protect children from harm and allow them to develop to their full potential . when i first started to work in romania nearly 20 years ago , there were 200,000 children living in institutions , and more entering every day .
many countries have developed national action plans for change .
awareness-raising is required at every level of society .
together , this is the one form of child abuse that we could eradicate in our lifetime .
that is , until just days before the trial , when a curious thing happened .
and it was among this information that they used to convict jeffrey sterling , risen 's alleged source and cia whistleblower .
since 9/11 , virtually every important story about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist .
and they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them , rather than on the witness stand after the fact .
we are drowning in news .
as we heard yesterday , there 's over a billion people hungry .
britain will starve without genetically modified crops .
but my pick for the top long news story of this past year was this one : water found on the moon .
my point is this : in the long run , some news stories are more important than others .
i wanted to make a point .
`` `` '' i was an active duty service member at a federal prison . ''
emotionally , i was a wreck .
so we choose to look at , and believe , this image .
`` `` '' we adopted our son . ''
`` `` '' i worked as a bartender and cook , average of 75 hours a week while pregnant . ''
i was allowed to bring my baby to work .
thankfully , my manager was very understanding .
we need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us .
he may or may not have been the first person to climb everest , more than 30 years before edmund hillary .
`` but he was credited with coining the phrase , `` '' because it 's there . '' '' now i 'm not actually sure that he did say that . ''
and my answer must at once be , it is no use .
we eat and make money to be able to enjoy life .
the north pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea , so i 'm traveling over the frozen surface of the arctic ocean .
mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain , and i wonder if that 's the case whether there 's something in the challenge itself , in the endeavor , and particularly in the big , unfinished , chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us , and in my experience that 's certainly the case .
that 's the scale . the red line is obviously halfway to the pole .
and yet , if i 've learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places , it is that true , real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge , from stepping away from what 's comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown .
in life , we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to , and i think metaphorically speaking , at least , we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often , if only we could summon up the courage .
this is the largest supermarket in the caribbean at peak shopping time .
this is a nurses ' college — there are 300 nurses studying .
this is the ministry of economics and finance .
aidg has worked in haiti since 2007 , providing engineering and business support to small businesses .
andre told me , after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way , that there is no new research here .
now there 's a solution to all these problems .
and we know how to build properly .
that is 500 times the power of the 7.0 that hit port-au-prince — 500 times the power , yet only under a thousand casualties .
`` he showed him , `` '' you know , we do n't have to do this wrong . ''
they tied the rebar right , they poured the columns right , and that building will be safe .
to make sure these buildings are safe , it 's not going to take policy — it 's going to take reaching out to the masons on the ground and helping them learn the proper techniques .
in fact , all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating .
they work even when you sleep .
men typically listen reductively .
noise like this , according to the european union , is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25 percent of the population of europe .
it 's a really big problem .
listen to this — this is an uncompressed piece of music .
i do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two .
you 're having to imagine it .
it 's not good for you in the long run .
the third problem with headphones is this : deafness — noise-induced hearing disorder .
ten million americans already have this for one reason or another , but really worryingly , 16 percent — roughly one in six — of american teenagers suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder as a result of headphone abuse .
one study at an american university found that 61 percent of college freshmen had damaged hearing as a result of headphone abuse .
we may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
i 'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children , please .
professional hearing protectors are great ; i use some all the time .
if you 're going to use headphones , buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you do n't have to have it so loud .
let 's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that i urge you to seek out .
i urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design soundscapes just like works of art .
first , ultrasound : we 're very familiar with it from physical therapy ; it 's also now being used to treat cancer .
there are great things being done there , treating now autism , dementia and other conditions .
there are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy .
i hope that that after this talk you 'll be doing that .
it 's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia ; to make music and sound in a group of people , whichever style you enjoy particularly .
and let 's start to speak up when people are assailing us with the noise that i played you early on .
i 'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life .
i hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart , as it did for me .
i not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like carnegie hall and kennedy center , but also hospitals , churches , prisons , and restricted facilities for leprosy patients , just to mention a few .
now , with my last piece , i 'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun , exciting , and that it can rock you .
`` let me introduce you to my brand new project , `` baroque in rock , '' which became a golden disc most recently . ''
just play your life with all you have , and share it with the world .
( music ) ( applause )
then i made some weird insects and creatures .
i did n't know what to do , because the resin was going to kill me .
there are the layers , you can kind of see it .
this box we 're in , the solar system is a box .
this brings you to my latest box .
we 're all really made up of the same stuff , in the same box .
maybe we 're not the right people to do it .
texting has developed one from this slash .
and she is .
that is who they were .
i walk into my childhood home and faint into my parents ' arms , sobbing .
investigation and autopsy reports eventually revealed the sequence of events .
chances are you have n't heard khalid 's story , because it did n't make it to national news .
the least we can do is call it what it is : a hate crime .
a couple of things .
others have done the same .
what resources and expertise do you bring to the table ?
`` he says to me , `` '' we 've done some work around the country . ''
going to scratch his nose .
you make the text larger with each tap .
more than one third of the world 's crop production is dependent on bee pollination .
now this business of hand pollination is actually not that uncommon .
tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes because they get much more efficient pollination when it 's done naturally and they get better quality tomatoes .
so there 's other , maybe more personal reasons , to care about bees .
now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative for the other 19,900-plus species because there 's something about honeybees that draws people into their world .
i was 18 years old and bored , and i picked up a book in the library on bees and i spent the night reading it .
it was like the best of science fiction come true .
so i went to work for a commercial beekeeper , a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in new mexico .
and i was permanently hooked .
honeybees can be considered a super-organism , where the colony is the organism and it 's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000 individual bee organisms .
now this society has no central authority .
for example , we study hygiene , where some bees are able to locate and weed out sick individuals from the nest , from the colony , and it keeps the colony healthy .
so honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses that have kept them healthy and thriving for over 50 million years .
so seven years ago , when honeybee colonies were reported to be dying en masse , first in the united states , it was clear that there was something really , really wrong .
so what 's going on ?
and the reason is , after world war ii , we changed our farming practices .
we stopped planting cover crops .
since world war ii , we have been systematically eliminating many of the flowering plants that bees need for their survival .
and then there 's pesticides .
after world war ii , we started using pesticides on a large scale , and this became necessary because of the monocultures that put out a feast for crop pests .
recently , researchers from penn state university have started looking at the pesticide residue in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food , and they 've found that every batch of pollen that a honeybee collects has at least six detectable pesticides in it , and this includes every class of insecticides , herbicides , fungicides , and even inert and unlabeled ingredients that are part of the pesticide formulation that can be more toxic than the active ingredient .
it 's called varroa destructor .
it 's aptly named .
let me put this all together for you .
and what if i had to travel a long distance to get to the grocery store , and i finally got my weak body out there and i consumed , in my food , enough of a pesticide , a neurotoxin , that i could n't find my way home ?
and this is what we mean by multiple and interacting causes of death .
it turns out , it 's hopeful . it 's hopeful .
every one of you out there can help bees in two very direct and easy ways .
plant them in a pot on your doorstep .
we need a beautiful diversity of flowers that blooms over the entire growing season , from spring to fall .
we need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows to disrupt the agricultural food desert and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system that we 've created .
on behalf of the bees , thank you .
the latest numbers on the die-off of bees , is there any sign of things bottoming out ?
maria spivak : yeah .
at least in the united states , an average of 30 percent of all bee hives are lost every winter .
so it 's getting precarious .
ca : thank you .
( applause )
despite all the technological advances — computers , i.t. , communications , telecommunications , the internet .
enigma number two : why is there so little engagement at work ?
disengaging their colleagues .
the way we organize is based on two pillars .
i forgot all the metrics , incentives , committees , middle offices and interfaces .
you have mr. noise , mr. petrol consumption , mr. anti-collision properties .
for any new requirement , you have a dedicated function in charge of aligning engineers against the new requirement .
what happens when the new requirement emerges ?
if repairability is the new requirement , the solution is to create a new function , mr. repairability .
how the parts work together .
it is not the skeleton of boxes , it is the nervous system of adaptiveness and intelligence .
whenever people cooperate , they use less resources . in everything .
when you design cars , please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the after sales garages .
no , they will refuse .
and why i try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife is precisely because i love my wife .
by removing layers .
this is what the automotive company did when they saw that mr. repairability had no impact .
you need also to increase reciprocity , by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient .
when you remove these buffers , you hold me by the nose , i hold you by the ear .
you need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who do n't cooperate .
when you do this , it has a lot of implications on organizational design .
my desire was to make it as a trek .
how do you break the barrier when you show up with a lens ?
vm : i think you break it with your body , more than with your knowledge .
the respect is stepping forward , not stepping backward , and i really think that by engaging your body in the moment , in the ceremony , in the places , people welcome you and understand your energy .
it 's correct ?
i really think of that as a matter of respecting the viewer , to not cut all the time from one place to another , to just let the time go .
`` bg : tell me in a few words about your new project , `` '' híbridos , '' '' here in brazil . ''
just before coming to tedglobal , you have actually been traveling around the country for that .
i shot the film in recife , in the place where he is from .
vm : i 'll just make it very short .
let 's click down now to the decade scale .
these boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents , and they are put to work as sex slaves .
he was taken to another province , where he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends .
the situation in quetta had changed dramatically since i left in 2005 .
it was a desperate decision to take , to leave everything behind , and no one makes this decision easily .
in indonesia , i joined a group of seven asylum seekers .
it was a thick forest .
and for me as a curator , i felt proud . i felt i 'd shifted the needle a little .
calls were recorded to tape .
the telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks .
government officials are extremely mad .
but those surveillance features come at a cost .
we need to secure our telephone calls .
i want you to use these tools .
the newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit .
so let 's go back to some of those people i talked about earlier .
now , they 're all people we 've investigated , and they 're all people who could n't do what they do alone .
well , i can tell you that , in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the korean school system , also known as pressure cooker , not everyone can do well in that environment .
while many people responded in different ways about our education system , my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building .
why bows ?
and they would be somethings like saws , knives , sickles and axes that i covered up with a piece of towel .
i would bring the branches home , riding buses and subways , barely holding them in my hands .
and i did not bring the tools here to long beach .
airport security .
( laughter ) in the privacy of my room , covered in sawdust , i would saw , trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape .
where ? the rooftop of my apartment building , a place where 96 families call home .
my mother had to do a lot of explaining , telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson .
i also researched extensively on bows around the world .
three : sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage .
after fixing , breaking , redesigning , mending , bending and amending , my ideal bow began to take shape , and when it was finally done , it looked like this .
thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention . ( laughter ) through bowmaking , i came in contact with part of my heritage .
learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me .
in the end , the grass is often greener on my side of the fence , although we do n't realize it .
now , i am going to show you how my bow works .
and let 's see how this one works .
this is a bamboo bow , with 45-pound draw weights .
each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being , and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow .
we live in tenuous times .
ok , so is better off just a number ?
all right , so is better off getting a big house with a white picket fence ?
he actually took his braces off himself with pliers in the garage , when his father admitted he did n't have money to go back to the orthodontist .
my parents made sure that i grew up on a kind of steady ground that allows one to question and risk and leap .
we should work like our mothers .
the common denominator is them .
we need to seriously consider a universal basic income .
some people are choosing to share homes not with family , but with other people who understand the health and economic benefits of daily community .
they understand that their quality of life depends on a mix of solitude and solidarity .
so big , shiny black solar cells on our roof mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds more than five bucks in a month .
the biggest surprise for me of living in a community like this ?
turns out , adults are healthier , too .
it 's a lot of pressure , trying to be that perfect family behind that white picket fence .
it 's good common sense , right ?
and yet , money has often made us dumb about reaching out .
the most reliable wealth is found in relationship .
if you 're a textbook success , the implications of what i 'm saying could be more grim for you .
only you can know .
in the midst of such widespread uncertainty , we may , in fact , be insecure .
but we can let that insecurity make us brittle or supple .
we can turn inward , lose faith in the power of institutions to change — even lose faith in ourselves .
or we can turn outward , cultivate faith in our ability to reach out , to connect , to create .
thank you .
and so i think we can roll the video that we have .
i always live in the present — i love the present .
that 's arthur leipzig 's original photograph i loved .
this is the uncle signing the adoption papers .
and they always overheat the hotels in korea terribly , so during the day i always left the window open .
i remember a sort of a tussle at the door , trying to get the door open .
it 's bigger .
we did n't really realize that until 1914 , when the last passenger pigeon , a female named martha , died at the cincinnati zoo .
suddenly it was n't here at all .
flocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long used to darken the sun .
well , commercial hunting happened .
this made people realize that the same thing was about to happen to the american bison , and so these birds saved the buffalos .
but a lot of other animals were n't saved .
it was loved . they tried to protect it . it died anyway .
it happened to lots of mammals .
there was a marvelous animal , a marsupial wolf called the thylacine in tasmania , south of australia , called the tasmanian tiger .
sorrow , anger , mourning .
do n't mourn . organize .
so he and ryan organized and hosted a meeting at the wyss institute in harvard bringing together specialists on passenger pigeons , conservation ornithologists , bioethicists , and fortunately passenger pigeon dna had already been sequenced by a molecular biologist named beth shapiro .
the passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome .
it 's been doing that since 2005 , and it 's likely to continue .
but some species that we killed off totally we could consider bringing back to a world that misses them .
thank you .
you 're going to uncork some sort of pandora 's box of who-knows-what . do they have a point ?
now , there 's the shifting baseline problem , which is , so when these things come back , they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love .
ca : thank you . ( applause )
in an uncertain global environment , commodity prices have fallen .
so that was number one .
and this mobile money is also providing a platform for access to alternative energy .
the other thing was that conflicts decreased .
so based on all this , there 's also some differentiation on the continent that i want you to know about , because even as the doom and gloom is here , there are some countries — côte d'ivoire , kenya , ethiopia , tanzania and senegal are performing relatively well at the moment .
you have to have more things wrong than right .
the second thing that we did is that the quality of growth was not good enough .
and population growth is something that we do n't have enough of a dialogue about on the continent .
the total consumption is equivalent to that of spain .
our manufacturing value-added is only 11 percent .
so that 's another serious problem .
governance is a serious issue .
we need to partner with international partners , developed countries , to fight this together .
so those are the things that we are not doing right .
now , where do we go from there ?
what does this do ?
the next thing is focusing with a laser beam on those things we did not do well .
we must .
i see it every day .
africa will continue to rise .
but what it means is that when you fight corruption , when you touch the pockets of people who are stealing money , they do n't just keep quiet .
they fight back , and the issue for you is when they try to intimidate you , do you give up , or do you fight on ?
and the answer that i had with the teams i worked with is we have to fight on .
and even out of government , we continued to make that point .
and therefore , that comes with consequences , and we just have to do the best we can .
and we live in a country today where we face serious criminal justice problems .
hockey .
now , here 's the really interesting part .
his formula , i 've learned , involved two parts .
since then , however , indonesia has taken a surprising turn .
so they waged their war with extraordinary delicacy .
it shattered the political paralysis that had gripped it for years .
they busted open mexico 's smothering monopolies .
bueno .
and that was no coincidence .
making big changes involves taking big risks , and taking big risks is scary .
i did n't have to think about the notes .
it 's keeping the lights on .
you want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
be who you to want to be , not who they want you to be .
so my hip had been hurting me for years .
this youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line .
`` `` after you . '' `` oh , no , no . after you . '' ''
and that business is agriculture .
it 's about visualizing the experience that people have .
it goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation and all the way back to the field and wheat , and one all actually goes all the way back to the big bang .
so it 's crazy stuff .
but i think it 's obvious that even though these drawings are really wildly different , they share a common quality , and i 'm wondering if you can see it .
and it 's the combination of links and nodes that produces a full systems model , and it makes our private mental models visible about how we think something works .
so sticky note systems are not only more fluid , they generally produce way more nodes than static drawings .
the drawings are much richer .
so here 's some key lessons that can emerge from this .
i taught myself to cook with a bunch of big books like this .
i went to chef school in france .
in the last 20 years , people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food .
but that 's not in any of those books .
a guy in england called heston blumenthal , he 's developed his avant-garde cuisine .
and finally , there 's the old way of viewing food is the old way .
and the hope was two-fold .
steaming ought to be faster .
it turns out it is n't because of something called film condensation , and this explains that .
`` well , that first cutaway picture worked , so we said , `` '' okay , let 's do some more . '' '' so here 's another one . ''
in this case , boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic .
and if you do lavish as much technique as possible , and you try to make the highest quality hamburger , it gets to be a little bit involved .
`` the new york times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called `` '' the wait for the 30-hour hamburger just got longer . '' '' because our hamburger recipe , our ultimate hamburger recipe , if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff , it does take about 30 hours . ''
most of the time is kind of sitting there .
and the answer is : no , not really ; we use a machine shop .
so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world .
( laughter ) we cut a $ 5,000 restaurant oven in half .
`` the manufacturer said , `` what would it take for you to cut one in half ? '' ''
`` i said , `` '' it would have to show up free . '' '' and so it showed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half . ''
we would glue a piece of pyrex or heat-resistant glass in front .
so it 's very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air , supported by wires , and then they take the wires away digitally so you 're flying through the air .
and so those coals that kept falling off the edge , we kept having to put them back up .
but again , it only has to work for a thousandth of a second .
but hey , they grow back .
this is fourier 's law of heat conduction .
we 've got lots of little tidbits in the book .
but now you will ; we put a biography of james watt in .
it turned out he was hired by a scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey .
that 's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent .
here 's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger .
now watch closely . this is popcorn . i 'll explain it here .
the popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .
so it 's a great illustration of that .
now i 'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual .
anyway , here 's the book .
here it is .
2,438 pages .
( applause ) a friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen , so there 's a sixth volume that has washable , waterproof paper . ( applause )
these are the maasais .
she 's beaten .
we can turn data into a time-lapse view of a global economy in motion .
and what we learn can lead us to new kinds of robotic flyers that can expand our vision of important and remote places .
the electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times .
can you guess what this is ?
at this rate , we 'll reach 9 billion people by 2040 .
so , my question : are we alone ?
we , all of us , are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from .
so , what exactly is seti ?
remember , one billion ?
but , this time not one billion dollars , one billion stars .
now , up there , 20 feet above the stage , that 's 10 trillion .
( laughter ) 16 times farther away than the moon , or four percent of the distance to the sun .
i think this is what david deutsch meant in 2005 , when he ended his oxford tedtalk by saying he had two principles he 'd like to share for living , and he would like to carve them on stone tablets .
and that 's the length of time that the earth was lifeless .
so , one needs a very deep appreciation of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos .
we 've been searching ever since , but it 's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains .
and over those long distances , its signal is very faint when it reaches us .
so i travelled to refugee camps in syria and in turkey , and i sat with families , and i listened .
refugee camp teachers and other parents are just like them — part of a new refugee community who 's struggling with new needs .
how could we help these families ?
hala simply could no longer cope .
and that 's something we can all relate to .
if you have been through a devastating time in your life , if you have lost someone or something you really care about , how would you continue to cope ?
when we begin to recognize the individual faces of the conflict , when we begin to notice those intricate emotions on their faces , we begin to see them as humans , too .
when these family needs are prioritized , interventions for children in humanitarian settings will prioritize and recognize the primary role of the family in supporting children .
we need to stop wars .
thank you .
( applause )
3:19 .
it 's there for our use , on some level .
this is the story of my brother .
so , here 's steven alone , sharing this story in the world .
there are so many other people sharing their stories .
i do n't even know what a medical record is .
it 's actually scary . it 's beautiful .
children , most of them , became very malnourished , like this .
that 's the camp that we have in now 90,000 people , where 75 percent of them are women and children .
pat mitchell : and this is your hospital . this is the inside .
it is very tough .
we are sharing with them whatever we have .
first rule : there is no clan distinguished and political division in somali society .
in a camp with 90,000 people , you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights .
so if you beat your wife , you 're going to be there .
( applause ) so empowering the women and giving the opportunity — we are there for them . they are not alone for this .
pm : you 're running a medical clinic .
so dr. deqo has to explain .
dm : for me , my mother was preparing [ me ] when i was a child to become a doctor , but i really did n't want to .
when the war broke out — civil war — i saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help , and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in somalia and help the women and children .
so some of our character , maybe we will come with a strong soviet background of training .
she 's here . she 's also a doctor .
but i remained with those people , and i was trying to do something — [ any ] little thing i [ could ] do .
pm : what 's the best part of working with your mother , and the most challenging part for you ?
that 's the best part .
you see 300 patients , 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage .
facebook has 1.2 billion users per month .
they are a site , along with others , that has allowed people to create an online persona with very little technical skill , and people responded by putting huge amounts of personal data online .
one of them is a sociological theory called homophily , which basically says people are friends with people like them .
and i see that as a real problem going forward .
and so how do you get a company to cede control of their main asset back to the users ?
this is hermann goering .
goering was hitler 's second in command in world war ii , his designated successor .
and like hitler , goering fancied himself a collector of art .
then the allied forces went through his collections and found the paintings and went after the people who sold it to him .
`` he said , `` '' i did not sell a great masterpiece to that nazi . ''
bring me a canvas and some paint , and i will paint a vermeer much better than i sold that disgusting nazi .
his american interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath .
but you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery .
`` according to his biographer , `` '' he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world . '' '' ( laughter ) and he killed himself soon afterwards . ''
it looked the same , but it had a different origin , it was a different artwork .
it was n't just him who was in for a shock .
why does this matter ?
i 'm a psychologists — why do origins matter so much ?
well there 's an answer that many people would give .
many sociologists like veblen and wolfe would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously is because we 're snobs , because we 're focused on status .
that humans are , to some extent , natural born essentialists .
i want to suggest that this is true , not just for how we think about things , but how we react to things .
so take food .
some of you would eat it if it 's beef , but not pork .
few of you would eat it if it 's a rat or a human .
it 's very simple : pour it from an expensive bottle .
there are now dozens , perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you 're drinking the expensive stuff , it tastes better to you .
but if you believe you 're drinking expensive stuff , parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a christmas tree .
or take sex .
and if you simply show people these pictures , they 'll say these are fairly attractive people .
but how attractive you find them , how sexually or romantically moved you are by them , rests critically on who you think you 're looking at .
you probably think the picture on the left is male , the one on the right is female .
( laughter ) it will make a difference if they turn out to be much younger or much older than you think they are .
if you like somebody , they look better to you .
( laughter ) a particularly dramatic example of this comes from a neurological disorder known as capgras syndrome .
now often , a result of capgras syndrome is tragic .
as a third example , consider consumer products .
you can put shoes on your feet ; you can play golf with golf clubs ; and chewed up bubble gum does n't do anything at all for you .
but each of these three objects has value above and beyond what it can do for you based on its history .
the golf clubs were owned by john f. kennedy and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction .
you could get something that looked like it or felt like it , but you could n't get the same object back .
so one answer was george clooney .
and the answer is a fair amount — more than you would pay for a brand new sweater or a sweater owned by somebody who you did n't adore .
`` as my wife put it , `` '' you 've washed away the clooney cooties . '' '' ( laughter ) so let 's go back to art . ''
i would love a chagall . i love the work of chagall .
if people want to get me something at the end of the conference , you could buy me a chagall .
in the case of artwork , the history is special indeed .
who here likes the work of jackson pollock ?
the interesting thing about marla olmstead is her family made the mistake of inviting the television program 60 minutes ii into their house to film her painting .
and here 's a brief clip of this .
so she 's struck with pity .
and people have different views on this .
but what i want to point out is you can buy this from itunes .
( laughter ) for a dollar 99 , you can listen to that silence , which is different than other forms of silence . ( laughter )
there 's no malevolence , they 're just pressing a button .
the first shock is recorded as very painful .
the pain gets less .
`` the point was nicely summarized by the poet john milton who wrote , `` '' the mind is its own place , and in itself can make a heaven of hell , a hell of heaven . '' '' and i 'll end with that . thank you . ''
( applause )
`` `` '' how is that possible ? '' '' you may ask . ''
when i was 22 years old , i was lucky enough to find my calling when i fell into making radio stories .
so i decided to pick up my tape recorder and find out more .
you come to this booth and you 're met by a facilitator who brings you inside .
people treated the experience with incredible respect , and amazing conversations happened inside .
josh has asperger 's syndrome .
they usually have obsessions .
in josh 's case , it 's with animals , so this is josh talking with his mom sarah at grand central nine years ago .
sl : and that helped when amy was born , but you are so incredibly special to me and i 'm so lucky to have you as my son .
( applause ) david isay : after this story ran on public radio , josh received hundreds of letters telling him what an amazing kid he was .
nobody comes to storycorps to get rich .
so many of these are just everyday people talking about lives lived with kindness , courage , decency and dignity , and when you hear that kind of story , it can sometimes feel like you 're walking on holy ground .
i 've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace that can be found in the words of people all around us when we simply take the time to listen , like this interview between a betting clerk in brooklyn named danny perasa who brought his wife annie to storycorps to talk about his love for her .
and i say it so often . i say it to remind you that as dumpy as i am , it 's coming from me .
ap : and i love you . i love you . i love you .
what else have i learned ?
i 've learned about resilience and i 've learned about strength .
hopefully one day , i 'll be able to experience that with you .
di : now i walk in love .
i 'm going to tell you a secret about storycorps .
participants know this recording will be heard long after they 're gone .
so , the ted prize .
it has a microphone , it can tell you how to do things , and it can send audio files .
that 's how great dreams are .
so we killed the project .
they wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling .
grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals .
marcus miller . ( applause ) harvey mason . ( applause ) thank you . thank you very much . ( applause )
but you have to have a device to go up in the trees .
it was lit only by the dim , green glow of the emergency exit sign .
he had embraced that mess , and it soared .
he did n't want to play .
another example .
some of carson 's undergraduate subjects struggled with that .
but no .
these distractions were actually grists to their creative mill .
so what do you do ?
a dash of mess .
and there were two treatments in this experiment .
and you may know him , he 's actually a ted-ster .
well , he makes a mess .
he disrupts their creative processes .
`` `` change instrument roles . '' ''
these cards are disruptive .
the musicians hate them .
the list did n't work .
( applause )
i 'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century .
this is van quach .
she changed her name to vivian because she wanted to fit in here in america .
her job , her goal and her calling was not to become the world 's greatest toilet scrubber .
that very human lesson , more than 20 years ago , served me well during the last economic downturn we had .
we were the largest operator of hotels in the bay area , so we were particularly vulnerable .
well , my name of my company , joie de vivre — so i started getting these letters from places like alabama and orange county saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a french company .
and i initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore looking for a business solution .
these three levels of the hierarchy needs relate to the five levels of maslow 's hierarchy of needs .
but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers , i realized we had no metrics .
so we started asking ourselves : what kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees ' sense of meaning , or our customers ' sense of emotional connection with us ?
we started asking our customers , did they feel an emotional connection with us , in one of seven different kinds of ways .
what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
they did n't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid .
so i started asking myself the question : how can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible ?
if we 're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure , and all we can measure is the tangible in life , we 're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid .
`` so here 's another einstein quote : `` '' not everything that can be counted counts , and not everything that counts can be counted . '' '' i hate to argue with einstein , but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually ca n't be counted or valued , are n't we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane ? ''
it was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my ceo hat off for a week and fly off to the himalayan peaks .
it 's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformational role model for the world .
the teenage king of bhutan was also a curious man , but this was back in 1972 , when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away .
this was a notable moment , because this was the first time a world leader in almost 200 years had suggested that intangible of happiness — that leader 200 years ago , thomas jefferson with the declaration of independence — 200 years later , this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something that we should measure , and it 's something we should actually value as government officials .
and i got to spend some time with the prime minister .
over dinner , i asked him an impertinent question .
one of those key indicators is : how do the bhutanese feel about how they spend their time each day ?
it 's a good question . how do you feel about how you spend your time each day ?
how many know him ? anybody ?
or in other words , i think the bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have — imagine gratitude — divided by having what you want — gratification .
their religion , their isolation , their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their gnh movement all have fostered a sense of gratitude about what they do have .
we are a bottom-heavy culture in more ways than one .
( laughter ) the reality is , in western countries , quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out — an object that we 're supposed to get , or maybe many objects .
bhutan 's created the ultimate export , a new global currency of well-being , and there are 40 countries around the world today that are studying their own gnh .
just three days ago , three days ago here at ted , we had a simulcast of david cameron , potentially the next prime minister of the uk , quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time , robert kennedy 's poetic speech from 1968 when he suggested that we 're myopically focused on the wrong thing and that gdp is a misplaced metric .
so it suggests that the momentum is shifting .
this is a collection of things that robert kennedy said in that quote .
as you look at these two columns here , does n't it make you feel like it 's time for us to start figuring out a new way to count , a new way to imagine what 's important to us in life ?
we 're not asking important questions .
and only 36 percent is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture .
so maybe it 's time that we get a bigger toolbox , right ?
they are n't the same .
in vivian 's case , her unit of production is n't the tangible hours she works , it 's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work .
he tells me that he can always count on vivian and the staff there to make him feel at home .
we count numbers .
we count on people .
i learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country .
what can you start counting today ?
i 'd also like to talk to you about palliative medicine : a paradigm of care for this population , grounded in what they value .
patient-centric care based on their values that helps this population live better and longer .
so the sickest 15 percent take up 15 percent of the gdp .
that does n't make sense .
we miss the human being .
we do things to this ; we need to do things for this .
two , improve the population health .
think about the human being .
two : population health .
not because they could n't .
but they did n't have to .
number three : per capita expenditures .
while harold 's time was limited , palliative care 's is not .
this is not just about the elderly , this is about people .
`` `` my kids , my wife and my harley . '' ''
`` ( laughter ) `` '' alright ! ''
and then we just talked .
`` i said , `` '' alright , let 's take it one day at a time , '' '' like we do in every other chapter of our life . ''
and we have met richard where richard 's at day-to-day .
jonathan is in his 20s , and i met him several years ago .
and do n't take my word for it .
and , ladies and gentlemen , they lived three to six months longer .
if palliative care were a cancer drug , every cancer doctor on the planet would write a prescription for it .
why do n't they ?
this is a space that we will all come to at some point .
but this conversation today is not about dying , it is about living .
so what does all this add up to ?
stepping onto the sidewalk , i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me .
now i was getting a little anxious .
just then , over my shout , i heard something else , a familiar rattle .
it sounded familiar , and i quickly considered another possibility , and i reached out with my left hand , as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy , and i came across an ear , the ear of a dog , perhaps a golden retriever .
two days later , my sight started to fail .
he was 36. i was seven at the time .
my son still had his dad .
so by the time i was discharged from the hospital a few days later , i left with a mission , a mission to get out and get the best training as quickly as i could and get on to rebuilding my life .
within six months , i had returned to work .
from that came a lot of insights , or outsights , as i called them , things that i learned since losing my sight .
and then i was also surprised by the city 's propensity for kindness and care as opposed to indifference or worse .
let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
similarly , just the sun warming one side of your face or the wind at your neck gives you clues about your alignment and your progression through a block and your movement through time and space .
some districts and cities have their own smell , as do places and things around you , and if you 're lucky , you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you 've been looking for .
what struck me also was how much the city was changing around me .
but one time i was in oakland walking along broadway , and came to a corner .
but believe me , there are more polite ways to offer assistance .
everybody 's welcome .
so thank you .
what determines the types and distributions of microbes indoors ?
at the biology and the built environment center , we carried out a study in a hospital where we sampled air and pulled the dna out of microbes in the air .
we looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated , which are the data points in the blue .
and we also sampled the outdoor air .
if you look at the y-axis of this graph , you 'll see that , in the mechanically ventilated air , you have a higher probability of encountering a potential pathogen , or germ , than if you 're outdoors .
and the first things that you can see from this graph is , if you look at the blue data points , which are the mechanically ventilated air , they 're not simply a subset of the green data points , which are the outdoor air .
what we 've found is that mechanically ventilated air looks like humans .
why does this matter ?
it matters because the health care industry is the second most energy intensive industry in the united states .
so just as we manage national parks , where we promote the growth of some species and we inhibit the growth of others , we 're working towards thinking about buildings using an ecosystem framework where we can promote the kinds of microbes that we want to have indoors .
and what we ultimately want to do is to be able to use this concept to promote a healthy group of microorganisms inside .
i think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin .
but the parents in the room know that texting is actually the best way to communicate with your kids .
it might be the only way to communicate with your kids .
( laughter ) the average teenager sends 3,339 text messages a month , unless she 's a girl , then it 's closer to 4,000 .
we 're now texting out to about 200,000 kids a week about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green or to work on homeless issues and things like that .
because this is n't what we do .
kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them and there 's nowhere else to turn that they 're sending them to us .
we can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals .
and so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things — charting the future essentially .
and they found things like , when you see crystal meth on the street , if you add police presence , you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen .
you could inform school policy .
`` you could say to a principal , `` '' you 're having a problem every thursday at three o'clock . ''
because while people are talking about data , making it possible for facebook to mine my friend from the third grade , or target to know when it 's time for me to buy more diapers , or some dude to build a better baseball team , i 'm actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting to help that kid go to school , to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom and absolutely to help that girl whose father 's raping her .
thank you .
( applause )
you 're about to experience a new , available and exciting technology that 's going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives .
what i have here is a cinder block that we 've coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface .
a windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees .
it 's that afraid of the water .
you 'd think it 'd be smooth , but it 's actually not .
( applause ) it 's going to happen . wait for it . wait for it .
as you regain your vision , you see a bloody face staring back at you .
this vision continues to visit you multiple times a day and in your sleep .
can you see bfib ?
i would n't have a name for my grandfather 's condition until i was in my 20s .
the results have been nothing short of spectacular .
finally , these invisible wounds do n't just have a name , they have a face .
i could talk to you about it right now if i wanted to , because it unlocked it .
melissa walker : over the past five years , we 've had over 1,000 masks made .
thank you .
a couple of years ago , harvard business school chose the best business model of that year .
it chose somali piracy .
pretty much around the same time , i discovered that there were 544 seafarers being held hostage on ships , often anchored just off the somali coast in plain sight .
shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been .
now that sounds absurd in singapore to say that , because here shipping is so present that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel .
a few years ago , the first sea lord of the british admiralty — he is called the first sea lord , although the chief of the army is not called a land lord — he said that we , and he meant in the industrialized nations in the west , that we suffer from sea blindness .
so most seafarers now working on container ships often have less than two hours in port at a time .
they do n't have time to relax .
they 're at sea for months at a time , and even when they 're on board , they do n't have access to what a five-year-old would take for granted , the internet .
now how is that possible ?
( laughter ) so we have these very multinational , global , mobile crews on ships .
and that was also shocking , because suddenly , i realized , as the captain said to me , that i had been crazy to choose to go through pirate waters on a container ship .
and at that time , there were those 544 seafarers being held hostage , and some of them were held hostage for years because of the nature of shipping and the flag of convenience .
not all of them , but some of them were , because for the minority of unscrupulous ship owners , it can be easy to hide behind the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience .
what else does our sea blindness mask ?
and shipping is the greenest method of transport .
and if you put shipping emissions on a list of the countries ' carbon emissions , it would come in about sixth , somewhere near germany .
i also traveled to cape cod to look at the plight of the north atlantic right whale , because this to me was one of the most surprising things about my time at sea , and what it made me think about .
we know about man 's impact on the ocean in terms of fishing and overfishing , but we do n't really know much about what 's happening underneath the water .
but i also want to see shipping , and us , the general public , who know so little about it , to have a bit more scrutiny , to be a bit more transparent , to have 90 percent transparency .
i have a son . his name is archie .
for me , it 's a very , very important thing .
and i noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space had already automated my job role .
but you 're doing work that embodies who you are .
i highly recommend it for sorting out what it is that you 're naturally good at .
and then the next step is our experiences .
we end up in the situation — we have that scripted life that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere .
`` and live your legend and the movement we 've built would n't exist if i did n't have this compass to identify , `` wow , this is something i want to pursue and make a difference with . '' ''
i swear there 's something in there .
and my guess is some people in this room might have done that before .
and today over 30,000 people from 158 countries use our career and connection tools on a monthly basis .
they are 100 percent in our control .
no one can tell you you ca n't learn about yourself .
things would start to change .
its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie .
now not all lies are harmful .
sometimes we 're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity , maybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret , secret .
`` so sorry . '' '' but there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception . ''
think enron , madoff , the mortgage crisis .
we wish we were better husbands , better wives , smarter , more powerful , taller , richer — the list goes on .
but in another study , it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .
if you 're an average married couple , you 're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions .
now , you may think that 's bad .
if you 're unmarried , that number drops to three .
we 're against lying , but we 're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries .
( laughter ) lying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
how early ?
well , there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass .
why is it so easy to learn ?
and these allegations are false .
well first we heard what 's known as a non-contracted denial .
you 've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door .
let the science temper your knowledge a little bit .
now we 're going to look at the hot spots .
can you tell what 's happening in a conversation ?
they 're going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth .
that person may be withdrawn , look down , lower their voice , pause , be kind of herky-jerky .
we rehearse our words , but we rarely rehearse our gestures .
now here 's the deal .
they 're not proof of deception .
and what 's kind of interesting is that today , we have so little darkness .
it represents hope . it represents potential .
my dear fellow citizen : i write to you today , to you who have lost in this era .
you fear the world i want to live in , and i fear your visions in turn .
do you also feel that now , fellow citizen ?
in this round , i sense that your fears of me , of the world that i have insisted is right for us both , has gathered over a generation .
you used to be able to count on work , and now you could n't .
i can not say i did n't know these things , but i was distracted creating a future in which we could live on mars , even as you struggled down here on earth . i was distracted
i heard all of these things , but i did n't listen .
it is for you to learn to live in a new century in which there are no bonuses for showing up with the right skin and right organs .
but i will admit , fellow citizen , that i have discounted the burden of coping with the loss of status .
i have forgotten that what is socially necessary can also be personally gruelling .
you have for years been telling me that your experience of these things is not as good as my theories forecast .
that is just my dogmatic economism talking .
`` we create our `` '' others . '' '' as parents , as neighbors , as citizens , we witness and sometimes ignore each other into being . ''
we can do this only if we first accept that we have neglected each other .
we could dare to commit to the dream of each other as the thing that matters before every neon thing .
( music ) ♫ i do n't understand myself , ♫ ♫ why they keep talking of love , ♫ ♫ if they come near me , ♫ ♫ if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand . ♫ ♫ i do n't understand myself , ♫ ♫ why they talk of magic , ♫ ♫ that no one withstands , ♫ ♫ if he sees me , if he passes by . ♫ ♫ but if the red light is on ♫ ♫ in the middle of the night ♫ ♫ and everybody listens to my song , ♫ ♫ then it is plain to see . ♫ ♫ my lips , they give so fiery a kiss , ♫

( applause )
you see , apple has made a conscious decision to get out of the surveillance business .
in contrast , the security of android just really is n't as good .
and we would expect a manufacturer of luxury goods to have products that include more features .
in contrast , the poor and the most vulnerable in our societies are using devices that leave them completely vulnerable to surveillance .
and it 's not just a privacy or a cybersecurity problem .
this is actually a problem for our democracy .
i 'll explain what i mean .
and so , naturally governments that feel threatened by these movements will also target the organizers and their smartphones .
should we be covering these things ?
it 's really terrifying .
hw : wow . thank you so much . cs : thank you .
( applause )
some companies succeed . others fail .
the first one is equality of quality of life , especially for children , that all children should have , beyond the obvious health and education , access to green spaces , to sports facilities , to swimming pools , to music lessons .
`` and the second kind of equality is one which we could call `` '' democratic equality . '' '' the first article in every constitution states that all citizens are equal before the law . ''
that is not just poetry .
for example , if that is true , a bus with 80 passengers has a right to 80 times more road space than a car with one .
we called it transmilenio , in order to make buses sexier .
in fact , it 's not just a matter of equity .
it does n't take ph.d. 's .
in fact , buses are not sexy , but they are the only possible means to bring mass transit to all areas of fast growing developing cities .
here , what you see is a picture that shows insufficient democracy .
here they made a flyover , probably very useless , and they forgot to make a sidewalk .
this is prevailing all over the world .
not even schoolchildren are more important than cars .
first of all , i had black hair before that .
it is a very difficult battle .
and i believe that our cities today have severe flaws , and that different , better ones could be built .
we have had cities for 8,000 years , and children could walk out of home and play .
only 20 years later , between 1920 and 1930 , almost 200,000 people were killed by cars in the united states .
only in 1925 , almost 7,000 children were killed by cars in the united states .
i will propose to you a couple of ingredients which i think would make cities much better , and it would be very simple to implement them in the new cities which are only being created .
in this picture , you see in one of the very poor neighborhoods , we have a luxury pedestrian bicycle street , and the cars still in the mud .
of course , i would love to pave this street for cars .
but what do we do first ?
as a latin american , and latin america was the most recently organized region in the world , i would recommend , respectfully , passionately , to those countries which are yet to urbanize — latin america went from 40 percent urban in 1950 to 80 percent urban in 2010 — i would recommend asian and african countries which are yet to urbanize , such as india which is only 33 percent urban now , that governments should acquire all land around cities .
the cities we are going to build over the next 50 years will determine quality of life and even happiness for billions of people towards the future .
they can create a much happier life for billions towards the future .
i am sure , i am optimistic , that they will make cities better than our most ambitious dreams .
hey , why not ?
( laughter ) baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
that means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
three times out of 10 .
do you know what they call a 300 hitter in major league baseball ?
suppose you have appendicitis and you 're referred to a surgeon who 's batting 400 on appendectomies .
but , but , you know what ?
somehow this is n't working .
1,000 , very good .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the admonition , be perfect .
i even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis .
and i did well , i graduated with honors , cum laude .
and it worked for a while , until i met mrs. drucker .
and to report back to my attending .
and when i listened to her chest with a stethoscope , i could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
and he knew her , he would have been able to furnish additional information about her .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending 's patients without even having to contact him .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
she was back and near death .
and i was shocked and shaken to the core .
and i went through this roller coaster , because after they stabilized her , she went to the intensive care unit , and i hoped against hope that she would recover .
and the family gathered .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
why did i go into medicine ?
and they did .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
`` `` do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat ? '' ''
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
now in both cases , i did n't send them home and i do n't think there was any gap in their care .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
but each time , they were gnawing at me , eating at me .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and weed out all the error-prone health professionals , well there wo n't be anybody left .
i 'm human . i make mistakes .
i still do n't know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
no one knows what the hell we do .
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
now , sadly , neurological disorders such as parkinson 's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend jan stripling , who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time .
however , there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor , rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it 's too late .
i mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
we see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity .
the neurologist 's test is non-invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
and they 're both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice-based tests are non-expert .
we can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it 's too late .
so , taking the first steps towards this today , we 're launching the parkinson 's voice initiative .
if you go even further , it turns into this green garden .
each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay , and it was the imperfections that people cherished .
i just took this out of the kiln last week , and the kiln itself takes another day or two to cool down , but raku is really fast . you do it outside , and you take the kiln up to temperature . in 15 minutes , it goes to 1,500 degrees , and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside , you can see that faint sheen , you turn the kiln off , and you reach in with these long metal tongs , you grab the pot , and in japan , this red-hot pot would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea , and you can imagine what that steam would smell like .
but here in the united states , we ramp up the drama a little bit , and we drop our pots into sawdust , which catches on fire , and you take a garbage pail , and you put it on top , and smoke starts pouring out .
raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity .
it was supposed to break , but that 's okay . ( laughter ) ( laughs ) that 's part of the letting go , is sometimes it happens and sometimes it does n't , because creativity also grows from the broken places .
the best way to learn about anything is through stories , and so i want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace in order for our own creativity to flourish .
mira nair : in this little town , there were like 2,000 temples .
julie burstein : is n't that a wonderful story ?
`` jb : richard serra says that so nonchalantly , you might have missed it . he went and saw this painting by a guy who 'd been dead for 300 years , and realized , `` '' i ca n't do that , '' '' and so richard serra went back to his studio in florence , picked up all of his work up to that point , and threw it in a river . ''
richard serra had to let go of painting in order to embark on this playful exploration that led him to the work that he 's known for today : huge curves of steel that require our time and motion to experience . in sculpture , richard serra is able to do what he could n't do in painting .
`` the educator parker palmer calls it `` '' the tragic gap , '' '' tragic not because it 's sad but because it 's inevitable , and my friend dick nodel likes to say , `` '' you can hold that tension like a violin string and make something beautiful . '' '' that tension resonates in the work of the photographer joel meyerowitz , who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography , for capturing a moment on the street , and also for his beautiful photographs of landscapes — of tuscany , of cape cod , of light . ''
on 9/11 , joel was n't in new york . he was out of town , but he raced back to the city , and raced down to the site of the destruction .
`` joel meyerowitz : and like all the other passersby , i stood outside the chain link fence on chambers and greenwich , and all i could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble , and i raised my camera to take a peek , just to see if there was something to see , and some cop , a lady cop , hit me on my shoulder , and said , `` '' hey , no pictures ! '' '' and it was such a blow that it woke me up , in the way that it was meant to be , i guess . ''
`` and when i asked her why no pictures , she said , `` it 's a crime scene . no photographs allowed . '' ''
`` and i asked her , `` '' what would happen if i was a member of the press ? '' '' and she told me , `` '' oh , look back there , '' '' and back a block was the press corps tied up in a little penned-in area , and i said , `` '' well , when do they go in ? '' '' and she said , `` '' probably never . '' '' and as i walked away from that , i had this crystallization , probably from the blow , because it was an insult in a way . ''
looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when i went home to my family at night .
my office was just a few blocks away .
but some of these photographs are beautiful , and we wondered , was it difficult for joel meyerowitz to make such beauty out of such devastation ?
jm : well , you know , ugly , i mean , powerful and tragic and horrific and everything , but it was also as , in nature , an enormous event that was transformed after the fact into this residue , and like many other ruins — you go to the ruins of the colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace — and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather .
it gets further and further away from the day , and light and seasons temper it in some way , and it 's not that i 'm a romantic . i 'm really a realist .
`` the reality is , there 's the woolworth building in a veil of smoke from the site , but it 's now like a scrim across a theater , and it 's turning pink , you know , and down below there are hoses spraying , and the lights have come on for the evening , and the water is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on , and i 'm thinking , `` '' my god , who could dream this up ? '' '' but the fact is , i 'm there , it looks like that , you have to take a picture . ''
this bowl is more beautiful now , having been broken , than it was when it was first made , and we can look at those cracks , because they tell the story that we all live , of the cycle of creation and destruction , of control and letting go , of picking up the pieces and making something new .
consciousness also is what makes life worth living .
i actually live there , around the corner .
man : ( in dutch ) does that sound like fun ? child : ( in dutch ) yes !
elon musk : well , it goes back to when i was in university .
i think it 's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production .
one is that , even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars , you 're still better off .
and the reason is , in the stationary power plant , you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more , is voluminous , and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source .
so in effect , even after you 've taken transmission loss into account and everything , even using the same source fuel , you 're at least twice as better off charging an electric car , then burning it at the power plant .
em : yes , it does .
and then the other point is , we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway , electricity generation .
in fact , we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack .
so as a result , the energy usage is very low , and it has the most advanced battery pack , and that 's what gives it the range that 's competitive , so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range .
ca : that was the good news . the bad news was that to do it , he had to drive at 18 miles an hour constant speed and got pulled over by the cops . ( laughter ) em : i mean , you can certainly drive — if you drive it 65 miles an hour , under normal conditions , 250 miles is a reasonable number .
not at all a dig at the new york times , this , by the way .
so we had a $ 100,000 sports car , which was the roadster .
and so i think we 're making progress in that direction , and i feel confident that we 'll get there .
do you see that coming , really , truly , or just on a few key routes ?
em : there actually are far more charging stations than people realize , and at tesla we developed something called a supercharging technology , and we 're offering that if you buy a model s for free , forever .
and so this is something that maybe a lot of people do n't realize .
so if you start a trip at 9 a.m. , by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat , hit the restroom , coffee , and keep going .
ca : all right . so this is only one string to your energy bow .
em : well , as i mentioned earlier , we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption , so i 'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar .
what most people know but do n't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already .
the whole ecosystem is solar-powered .
ca : but in a gallon of gasoline , you have , effectively , thousands of years of sun power compressed into a small space , so it 's hard to make the numbers work right now on solar , and to remotely compete with , for example , natural gas , fracked natural gas . how are you going to build a business here ?
em : no , we actually are . you can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system .
and the thing about solar power is that it does n't have any feed stock or operational costs , so once it 's installed , it 's just there .
it 's no money down , and your utility bill decreases .
no risk , you 'll pay less than you 're paying now .
em : well , essentially , solarcity raises a chunk of capital from say , a company or a bank .
so effectively it 's the first time there 's been competition for this monopoly , because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines , but now it 's on your roof .
ca : and you really picture a future where a majority of power in america , within a decade or two , or within your lifetime , it goes solar ?
em : more from solar than any other source .
you decided to build a space company .
why on earth would someone do that ?
we came very close to failure , but we managed to get through that point in 2008 .
you 've dreamed of mars and beyond ?
and i really think there 's a fundamental difference , if you sort of look into the future , between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization , that 's out there exploring the stars , on multiple planets , and i think that 's really exciting , compared with one where we are forever confined to earth until some eventual extinction event .
nasa has been doing this for years . how have you done this ?
em : absolutely . so the thing about rockets is that they 're all expendable .
the space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket , but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time , and the parts that were reusable took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight .
em : that 's right . so it 's important that the rocket stages be able to come back , to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours .
so it 's possible to achieve , let 's say , roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket .
so we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization .
and we 've had some good tests .
we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket . ( laughter ) ca : all right , let 's see that video then , because this is actually amazing when you think about it .
( rocket launch ) so now it 's hovering at about 40 meters , and it 's constantly adjusting the angle , the pitch and yaw of the main engine , and maintaining roll with cold gas thrusters .
these projects are so — paypal , solarcity , tesla , spacex , they 're so spectacularly different , they 're such ambitious projects at scale .
how on earth has one person been able to innovate in this way ?
through most of our life , we get through life by reasoning by analogy , which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations .
otherwise , mentally , you would n't be able to get through the day .
ca : boys and girls watching , study physics .
learn from this man .
em : thank you . ca : that was awesome . that was really , really cool .
these thoughts were going through my head when i looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book .
unfortunately , all his spinosaurus bones were destroyed in world war ii .
my fieldwork took me to the border region between morocco and algeria , a place called the kem kem .
we discovered many incredible specimens .
again , this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water , it 's useful for buoyancy control in the water .
our desks , our computers , our pencils , our buildings all harbor resident microbial landscapes .
as we design these things , we could be thinking about designing these invisible worlds , and also thinking about how they interact with our personal ecosystems .
if we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings , this opens a path to influencing our health in unprecedented ways .
`` this is a picture of tim , who , right when i snapped this picture , reminded me , he said , `` '' jessica , the last lab group i worked in i was doing fieldwork in the costa rican rainforest , and things have changed dramatically for me . '' '' so i 'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices , and we 're going to look at the data through a visualization tool that i 've been working on in partnership with autodesk . ''
if you look inside the restrooms , they all have really similar ecosystems , and if you were to look inside the classrooms , those also have similar ecosystems .
but if you look across these space types , you can see that they 're fundamentally different from one another .
we know that microbes are dispersed around by people and by air .
if you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another , they have very similar ecosystems , but if you go to an office that is a farther walking distance away , the ecosystem is fundamentally different .
he 's dedicated his life to sustainable design .
what we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant until saturday , when we opened the vents up again .
he felt like he had made a good choice with the design process because it was both energy efficient and it washed away the building 's resident microbial landscape .
the examples that i just gave you are about architecture , but they 're relevant to the design of anything .
as i said , it has a thick , extensive atmosphere .
and so it 's been tectonically altered .
this is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane .
and there is a lake scene in the south polar region of titan .
it is a total eclipse of the sun , seen from the other side of saturn .
`` and in my lab , i was studying the widower effect , which is a very old idea in the social sciences , going back 150 years , known as `` '' dying of a broken heart . '' '' so , when i die , my wife 's risk of death can double , for instance , in the first year . ''
and second , it was not restricted to pairs of people .
so i started to see the world in a completely new way and i became obsessed with this .
why are we embedded in social networks ?
so my first topic with respect to this , was not death , but obesity .
`` it had become trendy to speak about the `` '' obesity epidemic . '' '' and , along with my collaborator , james fowler , we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic and could it spread from person to person like the four people i discussed earlier . ''
in addition , if your body size , if your bmi , your body mass index , is above 30 — if you 're clinically obese — we also colored the dots yellow .
it 's not obvious exactly what 's going on .
how big are the clusters ? how far do they reach ?
and , most importantly , what causes the clusters ?
this here shows , on the y-axis , the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese and , on the x-axis , the degrees of separation between the two people .
there are at least three possibilities : one possibility is that , as i gain weight , it causes you to gain weight .
a kind of induction , a kind of spread from person to person .
and we found that if your friend becomes obese , it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent in the same given time period .
another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight , and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is .
now , headline writers had a field day with our studies .
`` blame your fat friends . '' '' ( laughter ) what was interesting to us is that the european headline writers had a different take : they said , `` are your friends gaining weight ? perhaps you are to blame . '' ( laughter ) ''
our next questions was : could we actually visualize this spread ?
so , again , every dot is a person .
we looked at smoking and drinking behavior , and voting behavior , and divorce — which can spread — and altruism .
and , in fact , emotional contagion can be broader still .
the question that we wanted to ask was : could emotion spread , in a more sustained way than riots , across time and involve large numbers of people , not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car ?
and if you look at this image , you can right away see clusters of happy and unhappy people , again , spreading to three degrees of separation .
so to invoke another metaphor , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity — i 'm connected to you and you to her , on out endlessly into the distance — this fabric is actually like an old-fashioned american quilt , and it has patches on it : happy and unhappy patches .
( laughter ) so , this work with emotions , which are so fundamental , then got us to thinking about : maybe the fundamental causes of human social networks are somehow encoded in our genes .
why do they not look like this ?
why do n't we form human social networks that look like a regular lattice ?
but that 's not the case with real networks .
that 's very obvious , we all know that .
but certain other aspects of social network structure are not so obvious .
compare node b in the upper left to node a in the lower left .
now , those people both have four friends , but a 's friends all know each other , and b 's friends do not .
and we think the reason for this is that some people like to introduce their friends to each other — you know who you are — and others of you keep them apart and do n't introduce your friends to each other .
they 're both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way — on the left — and you get graphite , which is soft and dark .
now , a superorganism is a collection of individuals which show or evince behaviors or phenomena that are not reducible to the study of individuals and that must be understood by reference to , and by studying , the collective .
like , for example , a hive of bees that 's finding a new nesting site , or a flock of birds that 's evading a predator , or a flock of birds that 's able to pool its wisdom and navigate and find a tiny speck of an island in the middle of the pacific , or a pack of wolves that 's able to bring down larger prey .
now , look at this .
similarly , social networks are required for the spread of good and valuable things , like love and kindness and happiness and altruism and ideas .
but there 's a fix for this .
so let me explain .
we cut roads through the forest .
we 've changed the chemistry of the soil with our artificial fertilizers .
now , i understand that there are certain parts of this nature that speak to us in a special way .
but ultimately , even these edens are deeply influenced by humans .
now , let 's just take north america , for example , since that 's where we 're meeting .
humans have just been involved in nature in a very influential way for a very long time .
`` now , just recently , someone told me , `` oh , but there are still wild places . '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' where ? where ? i want to go . '' '' and he said , `` '' the amazon . '' '' and i was like , `` '' oh , the amazon . i was just there . ''
they domesticate crops .
and many other tropical forests are the same , and not just tropical forests .
maybe we should define it by the presence of multiple species , by the presence of a thriving life .
all of a sudden , there 's nature all around us .
so to deal with this , the park service has been planting rust-resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park , even in areas that they are otherwise managing as wilderness .
native species are reintroduced .
you ca n't take home the pinecones .
the nature conservancy did a survey of young people , and they asked them , how often do you spend time outdoors ?
and only two out of five spent time outdoors at least once a week .
`` and when they asked them why , what are the barriers to going outside , the response of 61 percent was , `` there are no natural areas near my home . '' ''
and i 'm sure the figures are similar in other countries .
everybody lives near nature .
i mean , this is really an ecosystem .
`` so scientists have started calling ecosystems like these `` '' novel ecosystems , '' '' because they 're often dominated by non-native species , and because they 're just super weird . ''
and of course , pretty much all of hawaii , where novel ecosystems are the norm , where exotic species totally dominate .
he just stopped mowing his lawn , and after a few years , he had some grad students come , and they did sort of a bio-blitz of his backyard , and they found 375 plant species , including two endangered species .
first , we can not define nature as that which is untouched .
which brings me to the second thing that we have to do , which is that we have to let children touch nature , because that which is untouched is unloved .
i think i would much rather learn from this boy that no matter where this plant comes from , it is beautiful , and it deserves to be touched and appreciated .
so , these are the cities of the future , and we have to engage them .
`` this woman is nine , which means `` '' grandma '' '' in turkish . ''
i 'm here today to talk about social change , not a new therapy or a new intervention or a new way of working with kids or something like that , but a new business model for social change , a new way of tackling the problem .
it 's got to be worth something , right ?
i mean , there 's prison costs , there 's police costs , there 's court costs , all these things that you 're spending money on to deal with these guys . what 's it worth ?
now , of course , we care about the social value .
social finance , the organization i helped set up , cares about social stuff .
but we wanted to make the economic case , because if we could make the economic case , then the value of doing this would be completely compelling .
now , the social impact bond is simply saying , if we can get the government to agree , that we can create a contract where they only pay if it worked .
now , many of you may have noticed there 's a problem at this point , and that is that it takes a long time to measure whether those outcomes have happened .
socially motivated investors : there 's an interesting idea , right ?
so we find some investors , and they pay for a set of services , and if those services are successful , then they improve outcomes , and with those measured reductions in re-offending , government saves money , and with those savings , they can pay outcomes .
so in march 2010 , we signed the first social impact bond with the ministry of justice around peterborough prison .
now , each of those cohorts would get measured over the two years that they were coming out of prison .
so everyone wins here , right ?
the ministry of justice can try out a new program and they only pay if it works .
also , they make a reasonable return , and they also know that first investors in these kinds of things , they 're going to have to believers .
instead of just coming out of the prison with 46 pounds in their pocket , half of them not knowing where they 're spending their first night out of jail , actually , someone meets them in prison , learns about their issues , meets them at the gate , takes them through to somewhere to stay , connects them to benefits , connects them to employment , drug rehabilitation , mental health , whatever 's needed .
only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level of five gcses at 16 , against 58 percent of the wider population .
but there are great programs for adolescents who are on the edge of care , and 30 percent of kids going into care are adolescents .
essex only pays in the event that it 's saving them care costs .
investors have put in 3.1 million pounds .
obama has suggested 300 million dollars in the u.s. budget for these kinds of ideas and structures to move it forward , and a lot of other countries are demonstrating considerable interest .
by working to outcomes , people really have to test and bring data into the situation that one 's dealing with .
so taking peterborough as an example , we add case management across all of the different organizations that we 're working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners , and at the same time they learn from the ministry of justice , and we learn , because we pushed for the data , what actually happens , whether they get re-arrested or not .
so when you 're trying to do something like this , you need the flexibility to adapt the program .
the last element is partnership .
there is , at the moment , a stale debate going on very often : state 's better , public sector 's better , private sector 's better , social sector 's better , for a lot of these programs .
this leaves us with a way that people can invest in social change .
after some time , however , we had a tentative answer .
this is an image of me and my daughter holding the israeli flag .
a few days ago , i was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store , and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other , and the owner was explaining to the client that we 're going to get 10,000 missiles on israel .
it 's like , if we do n't act now , it 's too late forever , for 10 years now .
most of the time , i make posters , i post them on facebook , my friends like it , do n't like it , most of the time do n't like it , do n't share it , do n't nothing , and it 's another day .
so i went to sleep , and that was it for me .
and later on in the night , i woke up because i 'm always waking up in the night , and i went by the computer and i see all these red dots , you know , on facebook , which i 've never seen before .
and now people from iran are talking to me .
but more seriously , i was like , okay , these ones work , but it 's not just about me , it 's about people from israel who want to say something .
and she wished that we 'd meet and come to visit one another , and just a few days after i posted the first poster .
the day after , iranians started to respond with their own posters .
they have graphic designers . what ? ( laughter ) crazy , crazy .
and it became really big at some point .
and then it became news .
because when you 're seeing the middle east , you see only the bad news .
`` it 's everybody . '' '' the chinese . ''
something crazy also happened .
look at this one . this is the iran-loves-israel page .
this is a guy in tehran on the day of remembrance of the israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an israeli soldier on his page .
what ?
it 's like , we are showing respect , one to each other .
and you become friends .
so to me , this is the courageous thing to do , to try to reach the other side before it 's too late , because when it 's going to be too late , it 's going to be too late .
and sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe [ with ] effort , we can avoid it .
we can just send a message and hope for the best .
and maybe that image will help us change something .
that 's her boat , the american pearl .
her plan was to row it alone across the atlantic ocean — no motor , no sail — something no woman and no american had ever done before .
several years earlier , she 'd become the first woman to ski to the south pole .
and as frustrating as those days were , other days were like this .
dl : after nearly three months at sea , she 'd covered over 3,000 miles .
she was two thirds of the way there , but in the storm , the waves were the size of a seven-story building .
some of them were pitchpole capsizes , flipping her end over end , and rowing became impossible .
it 's so far underwater right now , the only part that 's showing pretty much is the cabin .
ah , listen , dear heart .
their friends drifted away .
one year turned to two , two turned to three .
meanwhile , my mind began knitting itself back together .
but no one realized that i had come back to life .
i simply existed .
other people controlled every aspect of my life .
i was confused .
following yet another heated argument between my parents , in a moment of despair and desperation , my mother turned to me and told me that i should die .
there were many moments when i gave up , sinking into a dark abyss .
alone with my thoughts , i constructed intricate fantasies about ants running across the floor .
to some i was martin , a vacant shell , the vegetable , deserving of harsh words , dismissal and even abuse .
to others , i was the tragically brain-damaged boy who had grown to become a man .
an aromatherapist began coming to the care home about once a week .
i started to feel whole again , a man worthy of love .
true communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world .
`` in two weeks time , that 's the ninth anniversary of the day i first stepped out onto that hallowed `` '' jeopardy '' '' set . ''
`` and given `` '' jeopardy 's '' '' average demographics , i think what that means is most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead . ''
( laughter ) but not all , a few are still alive .
for better or for worse , that 's what i 'm going to be known as , as the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff .
if nothing else , you realize very quickly as a teenager , it is not a hit with girls to know captain kirk 's middle name .
but if you go further back , if you look at it , it 's all there .
i now have a 10-year-old of my own who 's exactly the same .
`` and later , in the mid-'80s , when `` '' jeopardy '' '' came back on the air , i remember running home from school every day to watch the show . ''
it was my favorite show , even before it paid for my house .
you know some beatles factoid that dad did n't know .
`` i studied computers because i heard that was the thing , and i became a computer programmer — not an especially good one , not an especially happy one at the time when i was first on `` '' jeopardy '' '' in 2004 . ''
and of course i said yes , for several reasons .
people playing computers on game shows was the kind of thing i always imagined would happen in the future , and now i could be on the stage with it .
i had taken some artificial intelligence classes .
`` i knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on `` '' jeopardy . '' '' people do n't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program that can read a `` '' jeopardy '' '' clue in a natural language like english and understand all the double meanings , the puns , the red herrings , unpack the meaning of the clue . ''
and i thought , well this is going to be child 's play .
i remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph .
and at first , it was very low .
and i noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart some darker dots , some black dots , that were a different color .
this is what it looks like when the future comes for you .
watson 's actually huge .
you must come to it ; you must make the pilgrimage .
i do n't want to spoil it , if you still have this sitting on your dvr , but watson won handily .
and i remember standing there behind the podium as i could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking .
i felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete under this new regime of thinking computers .
and it has n't been the last .
i read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score from a baseball or football game and it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game and was commenting on it .
i 've heard other people say quite the opposite , that this is yet another tier of the middle class that 's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology and that this is actually something ominous , something that we should worry about .
all i know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work .
here 's the one thing that i was ever good at , and all it took was ibm pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people and thousands of processors working in parallel and they could do the same thing .
`` they could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national tv , and `` '' i 'm sorry , ken . we do n't need you anymore . '' '' and it made me think , what does this mean , if we 're going to be able to start outsourcing , not just lower unimportant brain functions . ''
is all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that ?
are we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less ?
`` i came to believe there were two advantages that those of us who have these things in our head have over somebody who says , `` '' oh , yeah . i can google that . hold on a second . '' '' there 's an advantage of volume , and there 's an advantage of time . ''
the advantage of volume , first , just has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays .
there 's so much information out there .
there 's just too much .
if we have those facts at our mental fingertips , we 're going to be able to make informed decisions .
the other issue is the advantage of time that you have if you have all these things at your fingertips .
it 's not always a tsunami , often it 's a social situation .
`` you say where you 're from , and i say , `` '' oh , yeah . '' '' or your alma mater or your job , and i know just a little something about it , enough to get the ball rolling . ''
people love that shared connection that gets created when somebody knows something about you .
`` ( laughter ) the great 18th-century british theologian and thinker , friend of dr. johnson , samuel parr once said , `` '' it 's always better to know a thing than not to know it . '' '' and if i have lived my life by any kind of creed , it 's probably that . ''
i do n't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced by these little bubbles of specialty , so that none of us know about the common associations that used to bind our civilization together .
and i feel like we 're sort of at the point now where we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in .
this is a question of leadership , because it becomes a question of who leads the future .
and we can all make that choice .
`` we make that choice by being curious , inquisitive people who like to learn , who do n't just say , `` '' well , as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over , i do n't have to learn anymore , '' '' or `` '' thank goodness i have my diploma . i 'm done learning for a lifetime . ''
`` i do n't have to learn new things anymore . '' '' no , every day we should be striving to learn something new . ''
these know-it-alls , they 're not rainman-style savants sitting at home memorizing the phone book .
ladies and gentlemen , the choice is yours .
thank you very much .
so , we 're going to put up some slides of some of your companies here .
so , you know , virgin atlantic , virgin records — i guess it all started with a magazine called student .
but , yeah , it was sad at the time , but we moved on .
ca : so , just help us with some of the numbers .
ca : and how many employees ?
rb : dropping in for tea .
ca : so , we 'll just run a couple more pictures here . virgin brides . very nice .
ca : so this interior is philippe starcke designed ?
rb : philippe has done the — yeah , quite a bit of it : the logos and he 's building the space station in new mexico .
and when you land , you 'll be able to go back into this giant eye .
ca : but you did n't have him design the engine ?
rb : well , i knew i had about half an hour 's fuel left , and i also knew that the chances were that if i jumped , i would only have a couple of minutes of life left .
but it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and — ca : what did you write to your family ?
ca : that is outrageous .
and they moved their bodies and they came forward , and the lights bounced off these costumes .
but somehow , it did n't matter about the publicity .
there was no money involved .
and you see the mechanics .
ariel : i have made you mad .
prospera : we are such stuff as dreams are made on .
but it 's very easy to climb up , is it not ?
and no hiking boots .
you may have heard of it .
`` `` '' my air jordans cost a hundred with tax . ''
parents say i should n't , but i knows i should .
but security is tight at all the shops . every day there are more and more cops .
this is serious business . this ai n't no fun .
as i took off with his sneakers , there was tears in his eyes .
very next day , i bopped into school with my brand new air jordans , man , i was cool .
`` and in 1996 , i found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named reg e. gaines , who wrote the famous poem , `` '' please do n't take my air jordans . '' '' and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ? ''
when he was writing a broadway show , i would be outside of the door .
`` then one day i told him , `` '' reg e. , what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration ? '' '' ( laughter ) and he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesis on a poet named etheridge knight and the oral nature of poetry , and from that point , reggie stopped becoming the best to me , because what etheridge knight taught me was that i could make my words sound like music , even my small ones , the monosyllables , the ifs , ands , buts , whats , the gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear , and from then on , i started chasing etheridge knight . ''
`` i wanted to know which poet he read , and i landed on a poem called [ `` '' dark prophecy : sing of shine '' '' ] , a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be : broadway , baby . ''
the biggest lesson i learned was many years later when i went to beverly hills and i ran into a talent agent who looked at me up and down and said i do n't look like i have any experience to be working in this business .
`` and i said to him , `` '' listen , punk fool , you 're a failed actor who became an agent , and you know why you failed as an actor ? ''
because people like me took your job .
i 'm so experienced that when you went to the fell school and all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child in it , that was me , but kicked me out when i was caught teaching the fairy boys how to rob the pats off a pair of lee jeans and bring them to vim . let me see chekhov pull that off .
dude , you go to riker 's island academy .
i could make david mamet psychoanalyze my attack on dialogue , stanislavski be as if he were bruce lee kicking your roster of talentless students up and down crenshaw .
thank you . ( applause )
but then the anger and the depression about my father 's death set in .
but i did n't really think it affected me .
keeps you safe .
most people recover from that pretty quickly .
about 20 percent of people , however , wind up with chronic , long-term ptsd .
as a result , the casualty rates have gone down .
the recent wars in iraq and afghanistan have produced , thank god , a casualty rate about one third of what it was in vietnam .
they 're shooting at people , killing people , getting shot at , seeing their friends get killed .
and suicide does n't even fit into this in a very logical way .
most people do n't realize that the majority of those suicides are veterans of the vietnam war , that generation , and their decision to take their own lives actually might not be related to the war they fought 50 years earlier .
if you 're in the military and you 're in a lot of combat , you 're no more likely to kill yourself than if you were n't .
and if you come back to an alienating , modern society , you might remain traumatized your entire life .
so what is happening with them ?
that alienation and depression can lead to suicide .
these people are in danger .
the israeli military has a ptsd rate of around one percent .
the theory is that everyone in israel is supposed to serve in the military .
and if you take that same lab rat and put it in a cage with other rats , after a couple of weeks , it 's pretty much ok .
even combat veterans of previous wars who suffered from ptsd said that their symptoms went down after 9/11 happened .
for a while , that was the kind of country that american soldiers came back to — a unified country .
it 's just getting worse .
race relations are terrible .
there are demonstrations and even riots in the streets because of racial injustice .
we 've gotten used to it .
this is the country they fought for .
there is no wi-fi involved , it 's just light .
and this is where the solar cell and the led come in .
and the answer to that is yes , we can .
but in order to prove the point , i can block the light of the solar cell .
but now imagine that this led lamp is a street light , and there 's fog .
and it really does n't matter where the beam hits the solar cell .
the first time i heard about this christian coptic community was in 2009 when the egyptian authorities under the regime of hosni mubarak decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs using the pretext of h1n1 virus .
add to it the din created by the crushers in those warehouses along the way .
in every work that i create , i write messages with my style of arabic calligraphy .
and for me this quote was perfectly reflecting the spirit of the project .
uncle ibrahim is such an enthusiastic person .
the building number 3 was the house of uncle bakheet and aunty fareeda .
for the first few days , they were always refusing anything we were offering them , even a snack or a drink .
( applause )
this is cbs sunday morning that aired about two weeks ago .
craig venter : can we explain how significant this is ?
my inspiration comes from problems in my daily life .
with a light-up crown and skirt .
i made a physical version of flappy bird that could never be taken off the app store .
( video ) friend : ah !
then a few of them started taking pieces of paper and decorating their robots .
and i also started to take these workshops outside of school and into the community .
this statistic might look familiar if you walked into a high school robotics club , or a college engineering class .
( laughter ) and finally , the third principle is customization .
this means that we can make this project relevant to anyone .
so even if you do n't like flappy bird , you can still make your own game .
millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around syria .
you talk about one million people .
`` and there is such a thing as international law , so there is no way you can say , `` '' i take 10,000 and that 's finished . '' '' i remind you of one thing : in turkey , at the beginning of the crisis , i remember one minister saying , `` turkey will be able to receive up to 100,000 people . '' ''
and europe has not been able to do so , because basically , europe is divided because there is no solidarity in the european project .
how do you imagine these people reacting ?
they have eritreans .
country by country , international organizations , the european union ?
who should be coming up with this support ?
yesterday , he said this .
bg : have the recent attacks in paris and the reactions to them made your job more difficult ?
bg : in what sense ?
for me it is clear .
last year , we helped 124,000 .
you know , one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver , always telling the new one what to do .
so that , i will not do .
`` if i had to say something to him , it would be , `` '' be yourself , and do your best . '' '' bg : commissioner , thank you for the job you do . ''
and really , that 's where this case should have ended .
landscape was not enough .
second woman : dad , mom , i grew up .
if someday i can achieve something , i would like to say thank you daddy and mommy .
we are endangering ourselves .
we have all a part of the solutions .
for women : self-confidence , empowerment .
what now are you looking to accomplish with the billie jean king leadership initiative ?
pm : billie , you have been an inspiration for us .
how about the setting in which animals need to use this call ?
but collision is a serious problem .
i 'll discuss two very promising approaches .
( applause )
that 's because most people think architects design buildings and cities , but what we really design are relationships , because cities are about people .
and besides , skylines are highly specific urban habitats with their own insects , plants and animals , and even their own weather .
here 's an example of what i mean .
the students wanted a place for cultural exchange .
and they wanted to be welcoming to the outside community .
community meeting houses are places where there 's very specific relationships between people , like this one in mali , where the elders gather .
it 's made of cordwood masonry , which is using logs the way you would use bricks .
you might only see people in those awkward elevator rides .
so we invented a way to use balconies as the new social connectors .
and equity is the key issue here .
in north lawndale , people are afraid of police and of going anywhere near the police station , even to report a crime .
it 's based on the idea that if you can increase opportunities for positive social interactions between police and community members , you can rebuild that relationship and activate the neighborhood at the same time .
and parents report something astonishing .
so maybe in the future , on the public side of the station , you might be able to drop in for a haircut at the barbershop or reserve the community room for a birthday party or renew your driver 's license or get money out of an atm .
i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p.o . box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in texting or cell phones in general .
and so when i moved to new york city after college and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression , i did the only thing i could think of at the time .
i blogged about those letters and the days when they were necessary , and i posed a kind of crazy promise to the internet : that if you asked me for a hand-written letter , i would write you one , no questions asked .
but what if it 's not about efficiency this time ?
or the man who decides that he is going to take his life , uses facebook as a way to say goodbye to friends and family .
these are the kinds of stories that convinced me that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair and talk about efficiency , because she is an art form now , all the parts of her , the signing , the scripting , the mailing , the doodles in the margins .
i once had this nightmare : i 'm standing in the middle of a deserted field full of land mines .
in real life , i love to hike , but every time i want to go on a hike , it makes me nervous .
mohammed , like so many other survivors all around the world , had to live through the horrifying repercussions of cluster munitions on a daily basis .
i saw the young boy who had to endure physical and emotional trauma .
`` and what for ? '' '' let me explain to you what a cluster bomb is . ''
it 's a large canister filled with bomblets .
these weapons are extremely unpredictable , which makes the threat even bigger .
lebanon holds some 400,000 palestinian refugees , and they suffer from discriminatory laws .
they 're not allowed to work in the public sector or practice certain professions and are denied the right to own property .
many who get injured by this weapon drop out of school , ca n't find jobs or even lose their jobs , therefore losing the ability to provide for their families .
he 's very cautious with his steps , as a couple of falls over the years brought him embarrassment among his friends .
he joked that since he does n't have legs , some days he tries to walk on his hands .
culturally , he 's expected to provide for his family , but he simply ca n't .
as an academic , i was a mere reader .
and so six years ago , i changed the direction of my career .
so how does multispectral imaging actually work ?
the results can be spectacular .
using infrared , we 've been able to read even the darkest corners of the dead sea scrolls .
`` `` subjects . '' ''
what about the future ?
shakespeare being seven ?
we need clean water to drink .
i 've often been verbally attacked behind their doors .
but that does n't solve my change room dilemmas , does it ?
they do n't make anyone safer .
but they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us .
and meanwhile , our trans children suffer .
do n't even get me started on how they treat us in airports .
and this starts very early .
i know a little girl . she 's the daughter of a friend of mine .
`` `` until you can get home ? '' ''
so let 's just do it .
what about people with anxiety issues ?
would all those people not benefit from these single stall facilities ?
chris anderson : the rights of citizens , the future of the internet .
( laughter ) ca : ed , some questions for you .
the internet is not the enemy .
es : absolutely .
thank you very much .
an asteroid impact ?
justin bieber becoming president of the united states ?
but that is n't the most likely scenario .
this is a winner-take-all scenario .
let me say that again .
`` this is how long `` '' the simpsons '' '' has been on television . ''
( applause )
2014 was the hottest year on record .
( laughter ) ( applause ) thank you .
the extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas .
most vaccines are delivered with the needle and syringe , this 160-year-old technology .
and credit where it 's due — on many levels , vaccines are a successful technology .
that 's a pretty hard act to beat .
and that 's problematic in terms of the rollout of vaccines .
now , related to this is another key issue , which is needlestick injuries .
now , these are two things that you probably may have heard of , but there are two other shortcomings of the needle and syringe you may not have heard about .
one is it could be holding back the next generation of vaccines in terms of their immune responses .
and the second is that it could be responsible for the problem of the cold chain that i 'll tell you about as well .
i 'm going to tell you about some work that my team and i are doing in australia at the university of queensland on a technology designed to tackle those four problems .
to the naked eye it just looks like a square smaller than a postage stamp , but under a microscope what you see are thousands of tiny projections that are invisible to the human eye .
and i 've designed those projections to serve a key role , which is to work with the skin 's immune system .
it 's a spring-operated device .
then we can take the nanopatch off and discard it .
we 've talked about it being needle-free — these are projections that you ca n't even see — and , of course , we get around the needle phobia issue as well .
so i 'll take a step back and explain to you how vaccines work in a simple way .
so vaccines work by introducing into our body a thing called an antigen which is a safe form of a germ .
but it could be argued that the needle is holding back our immune responses ; it 's missing our immune sweet spot in the skin .
and we see this kind of data .
now , this is real data — that thing that we can see there is one projection from the nanopatch that 's been applied to the skin and those colors are different layers .
now , as the guy that 's invented this thing and designed it to do that , i found that exciting . but so what ?
in the world of vaccines , what does that mean ?
so , we had to do that gamble .
if we 're above that line it 's considered protective ; if we 're below that line it 's not .
so the red line is mostly below that curve and indeed there 's only one point that is achieved with the needle that 's protective , and that 's with a high dose of 6,000 nanograms .
that 's a real fresh opportunity .
we can push that lever to help get those candidate vaccines over the line .
as the name suggests — the cold chain — it 's the requirements of keeping a vaccine right from production all the way through to when the vaccine is applied , to keep it refrigerated .
now , that presents some logistical challenges but we have ways to do it .
now , the stakes are very high .
and as a scientist , i love that and i love science .
but also , papua new guinea has the world 's highest incidence of hpv , human papillomavirus , the cervical cancer [ risk factor ] .
so for those two reasons , with the attributes of the nanopatch , we 've got into the field and worked with the nanopatch , and taken it to papua new guinea and we 'll be following that up shortly .
now , doing this kind of work is not easy .
( applause )
so that 's a three-to-one return .
and then , as the other axis kicks in , those actually blur into a volume .
they were amazing — like you can see here .
`` participants were given a list of ice- breaker questions to get the ball rolling , things like , `` '' if you could be any kind of animal , what would you be ? '' '' that sort of thing . ''
alec and i saw him at the end of the evening , and he said he 'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession stands .
this is carl .
alec actually liked his eyes and asked if i was attracted to him , but i was n't , and i do n't think he was attracted to me either .
austin and mike came together .
he thought i was lying , but i was n't .
william was really difficult to talk to .
i think he was drunk .
( laughter ) actor chris mckenna was the mc of the event .
alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him .
needless to say , i did n't fall in love .
at this date-a-thon event , i saw so many examples of that , but as i watched stacey 's dates and talked to her about them , i realized how different photographic love is from real love .
amazingly , mary took him back , and eventually things got better .
now , by the time we met joe and roseanne , we 'd gotten in the habit of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph .
in their case , they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets the exact same photograph .
register , for example .
in the case of this little example i 'm holding , we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light .
two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi-touch systems .
so i 'm a social scientist by training , so why am i here today talking about smart materials ?
so a little over three years ago , kirsty boyle and i started a project we called open materials .
but why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of ?
the objects we use , the clothes we wear , the houses we live in , all have a profound impact on our behavior , health and quality of life .
two scientists at university of illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink .
jordan then published his results online , including all the things he had tried and did n't work , so others could study and reproduce it .
so jordan 's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself .
her project 's goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder .
electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn .
so hannah 's approach , on the other hand , is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre-designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves .
we often tackle problems from unconventional angles , and , in the process , end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things .
thank you .
but before i show you how all of this is possible , let 's talk briefly about why improving the quality of science education is so vitally important .
and who , exactly , is going to help us solve all of these great challenges ?
i will explain briefly what this is .
do you see me up on the screen ?
and here , i have my learning tablet .
and now before i finalize this , i want to show you an even cooler thing , i think — something you can not even do in real laboratories .
and that was that he did not have access to real laboratories , because he was too inexperienced to be allowed in .
the second is columbus finally gets funded to go to india , but he gets lost .
dr. razem : it 's time to go , miklos .
i do n't deserve it . i do n't deserve anything .
dr. razem : do n't listen to them .
as the father of five sons , i worry about who they 're going to be using as role models .
he actually called me a meddling kid the other day .
and then you 'll be even more convinced you ca n't succeed .
you have to fight feelings of helplessness .
and he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy .
now , we rarely make really totally rational choices .
we barely break even . there is no fame in it .
it 's the most powerful thing you own .
i was part of a team that was tasked with trying to figure out how best to respond to this humanitarian catastrophe .
it was right on the heels of the rwandan genocide , and aid money to the region was drying up .
she had died hours before of malnutrition and dehydration .
after all , it is as old as existence itself .
how so ?
and so now the important part : can anything be done about this ?
and what do we notice ?
well , you see them in green .
and then what if we go beyond small arms for a second .
who does the biggest business ?
`` now , some of you might be saying at this moment in time , `` oh yeah , but ok , hang on a second there ... nutt . '' ''
but here 's what we should really take away from this .
you know , the curbing of small arms — it 's not going to solve the problem of war .
and it 's up to all of us who live in those rich countries to make change here .
you know , there are generations around the world who are being lost to war .
when i first got on that plane for somalia as a young doctor , i had no idea what it meant to live with war .
but i can tell you that i know what it means now .
over the years of doing this work , unfortunately , war has killed far too many people close to me .
we are therefore not powerless to solve it .
on the contrary , we are the only ones who can .
and i 'm telling you , it 's not even close .
and they do something incredibly cool .
but nothing else does either .
what should i actually try to replicate ?
tom hanks : hello , houston , this is odyssey .
gloria stuart : that was the last time titanic ever saw daylight .
everything in america is so much bigger than in europe .
look at me — i am huge !
and i always feel rather smug then .
i think they are a cancer of the soul .
in britain , we have a particularly vicious section of the right-wing press , and they went nuts .
and i was giving a talk in 2015 about the suffragettes — i 'm sure you know those magnificent women who fought so hard for the right for women in britain to vote .
2133 !
we are not going to get equal pay in my grandchildren 's grandchildren 's lives under the current system .
i 've waited long enough in my own business .
is n't that great ? wonderful , i 'm thrilled .
and what is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow ?
augmented reality is something that will happen in our lifetime , and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen , and people need to be aware of that , because augmented reality will change our lives just as much as the internet and the cell phone .
what you may not be familiar with is that google glass is a device that will allow you to see what i see .
it will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional athlete on the field .
we have some video of that courtesy of the university of washington .
ck : so again , this takes you a little bit closer to what it 's like to be on that field , but this is nowhere what it 's like to be on the nfl .
can you get this on a running back ?
they protested across britain .
or if you take eglantyne jebb , the woman who created save the children 90 years ago .
but what more could she have done if she’d had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately ?
100 years ago in most countries in europe , the pressure was for the right to vote .
i was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation .
i was sitting next to nelson mandela — i was very privileged to do so — when amy winehouse came onto the stage . ( laughter ) and nelson mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and i was explaining to him at the time who she was .
he said that there was a greater challenge ahead , the challenge of poverty , of climate change — global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society .
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally , with the challenges that we now face , most of which are global in their nature .
climate change can not be solved in one country , but has got to be solved by the world working together .
take the problems of security and terrorism and , equally , the problem of human rights and development : they can not be solved by africa alone ; they can not be solved by america or europe alone .
you need in the long run for stability , for economic growth , for jobs , as well as for financial stability , global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared , and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible .
so another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility , not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years .
i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone .
`` it said `` '' david , age 10 . '' '' david : ambition to be a doctor . ''
how did he die ?
we have the means by which we could create a truly global society .
the institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors .
that global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work , but we should not lose the chance in this generation , in this decade in particular , with president obama in america , with other people working with us around the world , to create global institutions for the environment , and for finance , and for security and for development , that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples , our desire to bind the world together , and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist .
thank you .
death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure .
but what is it , exactly ?
vaccine development is expensive and complicated .
we have to stop waiting until we see evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one .
and they have different properties .
sadly , about 40 percent of us will hear those three words within our lifetime , and half will not survive .
this disease is pervasive .
like a tornado strike in an area without an early warning system , there is no alarm to warn , for the danger is already at your doorstep when your odds of survival are greatly reduced .
having the convenience and accessibility of regular screening options that are affordable , noninvasive and could provide results much sooner , would provide us with a formidable weapon in the fight against cancer .
an early warning would allow us to get out ahead of the disease instead of merely following in its relentless wake .
and this is exactly what i 've been doing .
still , not everyone has this done , or they may develop breast cancer before the middle age recommendation for having a mammogram .
so , there 's still a lot of room for improvement , even for cancers that do have screening options , and , of course , considerable benefits for those that do n't .
the silver bullet in this case are tiny vesicles , little escape pods regularly shed by cells called exosomes .
we 've created a technology that we call nano-dld that is capable of precisely this : automated exosome isolation to aid rapid cancer diagnostics .
while the first exosome-based diagnostics emerged on the market just this year , they are not yet part of mainstream healthcare options .
you can visualize this separation process similar to traffic on a highway that separates into two roads , with one road going into a low-clearance tunnel under a mountain , and the other road going around it .
this would make rapid diagnostics virtually painless .
or they 're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many , or most , of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question .
and these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in tunisia and egypt this past spring and beyond .
`` as wael ghonim , the google-egyptian-executive by day , secret-facebook-activist by night , famously said to cnn after mubarak stepped down , `` '' if you want to liberate a society , just give them the internet . '' '' but overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated . ''
but you 'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence .
but if you look at china , vietnam and a number of the former soviet states , what 's happening there is more troubling .
you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where , effectively , the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government .
`` now in china , you have the `` '' great firewall , '' '' as it 's well-known , that blocks facebook and twitter and now google+ and many of the other overseas websites . ''
and robin li , ceo of baidu , china 's dominant search engine , was one of the recipients .
and earlier this year , there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to rospil through a payments processing system called yandex money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at yandex money .
of course , it 's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is .
how do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most ceo 's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit ?
similarly , governments do n't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day .
we also are going to need political innovation .
eight hundred years ago , approximately , the barons of england decided that the divine right of kings was no longer working for them so well , and they forced king john to sign the magna carta , which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules .
at the moment , we still do n't know .
thank you very much .
so this is a new species we described , from southern indiana .
so this sets up this beautiful natural experiment where we can look at the genes behind our vision , and at the very roots of how we can see .
so in fact , these species did n't move at all .
now , we actually do n't know this species ' closest relative , yet .
thank you .
you know , white , brown , whatever — i loved them all .
`` i was very confused because i was thinking , well , `` '' my white people , come on ! where are they ? what 's going on ? ''
so very quickly , i was starting to become attacked at my own concerts .
so once again , i packed my suitcase , i left music and i moved to the us .
and i was certainly not going to be killed for something that was n't even my dream — it was my father 's choice .
and , to my surprise , what i found was so many of these young people were suffering and struggling .
they were facing so many problems with their families and their communities who seemed to care more about their honor and their reputation than the happiness and the lives of their own kids .
kids we are losing to forced marriages , to honor-based violence and abuse .
the same men , or similar men , to the ones that have hounded me for most of my life .
men that i 've been afraid of most of my life .
`` `` '' come to us , '' '' they say . ''
they make the powerless feel powerful .
this is what they 're doing for our young people .
what i am trying to say is that we have to understand why some of our young people are attracted to this .
the same feeling of being lost and torn between cultures .
and the reason i did that is because of my superpower .
can we make ourselves care about them and consider them to be our own ?
and not just be outraged when the victims of violence look like ourselves ?
can we find a way to reject hatred and heal the divisions between us ?
and in the long term , revenge and violence will not work against extremists .
this image is the kryptonite for extremists .
after all , the meme for shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite .
one sculpture became two .
it is textured to allow coral polyps to attach .
so why exhibit my work in the ocean ?
fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed .
coralline algae applies a kind of purple paint .
`` visitors to `` '' ocean atlas '' '' in the bahamas highlighted a leak from a nearby oil refinery . ''
so why are we all here today in this room ?
and what do you see here ?
so let 's think big and let 's think deep .
thank you .
and it did n't even matter until i was 27 .
but after a couple of years , just writing songs was n't enough .
( laughter ) i have never been more terrified — until now .
i 'm embarrassed , the audience is clearly uncomfortable , they 're focused on my discomfort .
and i did . i went back every single week , and sure enough , week after week , it did n't get any better . the same thing happened every week . ( laughter ) i could n't shake it .
that only seems authentic when i have stage fright , and the more nervous i was , the better the song would be . easy .
first , fessing up to the problem , the physical manifestations , how i would feel , how the listener might feel .
they did n't have to feel bad for me because i was nervous , they could experience that with me , and we were all one big happy , nervous , uncomfortable family . ( laughter ) by thinking about my audience , by embracing and exploiting my problem , i was able to take something that was blocking my progress , and turn it into something that was essential for my success .
except for when i was really nervous , like now . ( laughter ) would it be okay if i played the stage fright song for you ?
( applause ) can i have a sip of water ?
but scientists have for a long time thought this just was never going to be possible .
they thought you just wear out , there 's nothing you can do about it — kind of like an old shoe .
now these animals are different from one another , because they have different genes .
and if you could do that , then you could find the genes for aging .
and we did n't study any of these animals .
instead , we studied a little , tiny , round worm called c. elegans , which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence .
but at that time , most of the mutant worms are still alive .
so the first thing you 're going to see is the normal worm when it 's about college student age — a young adult .
and next you 're going to see the long-lived mutant when it 's young .
so this animal is going to live twice as long .
is it miserable ? it does n't seem to be .
and now here is the daf-2 mutant .
one gene is changed out of 20,000 , and look at it .
this is what 's really cool : it 's aging more slowly .
it takes this worm two days to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day .
and you meet someone you really like , you get to know her .
so part of it is like a baseball glove .
it says that aging is subject to control by the genes , and specifically by hormones .
now you 've all heard of at least insulin .
insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal .
and the hormone igf-1 promotes growth .
so for example , there was one study that was done in a population of ashkenazi jews in new york city .
they hardly get cancer , and when they do it 's not as severe .
and the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes , genes i call carrot-giver genes , whose protein products actually help other proteins to function well — to fold correctly and function correctly .
and it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell and recycle them if they 're damaged .
and the immune system is more active .
so it 's really interesting .
so what about the normal worm ?
that 's how it works . that 's why we do n't see the long lifespan , until we have the daf-2 mutant .
well we think that insulin and igf-1 hormones are hormones that are particularly active under favorable conditions — in the good times — when food is plentiful and there 's not a lot of stress in the environment .
and that 's why we think the animals live longer .
and then the hurricane comes through , and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in .
and that 's the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
and that means that , maybe if we tweak it a little bit , we can increase the health and longevity of people .
a foxo is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people .
there are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging .
and for at least one of them , there is a drug .
now i do n't want you all to go out taking rapamycin .
thank you .
ck : ah , so the kinds of drugs i was talking about would not change the genes , they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity .
you could change the genes in principle .
and the reason is that these hormones , like the insulin and the igf hormones and the tor pathway , they 're essential .
so it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully to get the benefits without getting any problems .
and i think that 's much better , that kind of control would be much better as a drug .
and when you look at these 70 year-old turtles , you ca n't tell the difference , just by looking , between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles .
they 're more resistant to these kinds of stresses .
and maybe they 're even set really differently in animals with no senescence at all — but we do n't know .
these groups are hybrid .
i 'd like to share with you a story about how i 've experienced this very dramatically in my own work .
when i make an incision inside a patient 's body , it 's dark .
we need to shine light to see what we 're doing .
and this is why , traditionally , surgeries have always started so early in the morning — to take advantage of daylight hours .
and if you look at historical pictures of the early operating rooms , they have been on top of buildings .
and then this is a picture of one of the most famous hospitals in america .
and do you know where the operating room is ?
and because we no longer need to use sunlight , we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room .
and this is what i think is the magic of fluorescence .
so let me back up a little bit .
nerves are yellow , arteries are red , veins are blue .
the nurses , anesthesiologist , the surgeon , all the assistants are waiting around .
and we wait .
and that may be 20 minutes later per piece .
`` there 's still cancer in your patient . '' '' so now you 're faced with telling your patient , first of all , that they may need another surgery , or that they need additional therapy such as radiation or chemotherapy . ''
i mean , in many ways , the way that we 're doing it , we 're still operating in the dark .
so in 2004 , during my surgical residency , i had the great fortune to meet dr. roger tsien , who went on to win the nobel prize for chemistry in 2008 .
and the two pieces are then linked by something that can only be cut if you have the right molecular scissors — for example , the kind of protease enzymes that tumors make .
and now , boom , the tumor labels itself and it gets fluorescent .
can you tell where the tumor is ?
i could n't when i was working on this .
but here it is . it 's fluorescent .
we can tell in the operating room , in the field , at a molecular level , where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do and how much more work they need to do to cut that out .
and the cool thing about fluorescence is that it 's not only bright , it actually can shine through tissue .
there 's actually normal muscle on top of it . see that ?
sentinel lymph node dissection has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer , melanoma .
and then if that node has cancer , the woman would go on to get the axillary lymph node dissection .
but sentinel lymph node , the way that we do it today , is kind of like having a road map just to know where to go .
so if you 're driving on the freeway and you want to know where 's the next gas station , you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road .
you see a lot of little , roundish bumps there .
nerves , if they are injured , can cause paralysis , can cause pain .
`` we have n't had that many complications . '' '' but i went ahead anyway . ''
you can see where they are .
do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is ?
that white portion there is easy to see .
we received commentary in discover magazine , in the economist .
and we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues .
`` they said , `` '' wow ! ''
i have patients who would benefit from this .
`` i think that this will result in my surgeries with a better outcome and fewer complications . '' '' what needs to happen now is further development of our technology along with development of the instrumentation that allows us to see this sort of fluorescence in the operating room . ''
successful innovation is not a single breakthrough .
it 's a medical story , but more than that , it 's a social story .
they go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum-based education , training .
our organization has three goals .
i 've been a journalist now since i was about 17 , and it 's an interesting industry to be in at the moment , because as you all know , there 's a huge amount of upheaval going on in media , and most of you probably know this from the business angle , which is that the business model is pretty screwed , and as my grandfather would say , the profits have all been gobbled up by google .
it 's on the input side . it 's concern with how we get information and how we gather the news .
and that 's changed , because we 've had a huge shift in the balance of power from the news organizations to the audience .
so i wrote a letter .
i 'm not sure if i had any impact on the one-day strike , but what i do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me .
and that was the round journey . it took that long for anyone to have any impact and get some feedback .
so it 's a real-time thing . it 's much quicker . it 's happening on a constant basis , and the journalist is always playing catch up .
it was a 7.6 magnitude . it was fairly big .
and 60 seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel 250 kilometers to managua .
so the ground shook in managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter .
so 60 seconds was how long it took for the physical earthquake to travel .
more than three and a half thousand photos go up onto facebook .
so by the time i 'm finished talking here , there 'll be 864 more hours of video on youtube than there were when i started , and two and a half million more photos on facebook and instagram than when i started .
we had to deal with composite images that were merging photos from previous storms .
`` we had to deal with images from films like `` '' the day after tomorrow . '' '' ( laughter ) and we had to deal with images that were so realistic it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all . ( laughter ) ''
and a good example of how useful it can be but also how difficult was the egyptian revolution in 2011 .
as a non-arabic speaker , as someone who was looking from the outside , from dublin , twitter lists , and lists of good sources , people we could establish were credible , were really important .
this visualization was done by an italian academic .
he 's called andré pannison , and he basically took the twitter conversation in tahrir square on the day that hosni mubarak would eventually resign , and the dots you can see are retweets , so when someone retweets a message , a connection is made between two dots , and the more times that message is retweeted by other people , the more you get to see these nodes , these connections being made .
and you have to do that investigative work .
( rain and wind sounds ) ( explosion ) oh , shit !
markham nolan : okay , so now if you 're a news producer , this is something you 'd love to run with , because obviously , this is gold .
you know ? this is a fantastic reaction from someone , very genuine video that they 've shot in their back garden .
but we started looking , and we used free internet tools to do so .
so we looked all over the u.s. we found them in new york , we found them in pennsylvania , nevada and florida .
so we went and we looked for a second free internet tool called wolfram alpha , and we checked the weather reports for the day in which this video had been uploaded , and when we went through all those various cities , we found that in florida , there were thunderstorms and rain on the day .
and we went back to google maps , and we looked a little bit closer , and sure enough , there 's the white lilo , there are the two trees , there 's the umbrella . it 's actually folded in this photo .
little bit of trickery . and there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool .
so this video , i 'm not going to show you the whole thing , because it 's quite gruesome , but you 'll hear some of the sounds .
three different sources said three different things about the bridge .
and also , as you look away from the bridge , there 's a divot on the left-hand side of the bank , and the river narrows .
so onto google maps we go , and we start looking through literally every single bridge .
so we go a bit further . we switch to the satellite view , and we find another bridge , and everything starts to line up .
we start to see that it 's got a median , so it 's a two-lane bridge .
and it 's got the black-and-white curbs that we saw in the video , and as we click through it , you can see someone 's uploaded photos to go with the map , which is very handy , so we click into the photos . and the photos start showing us more detail that we can cross-reference with the video .
the first thing that we see is we see black-and-white curbing , which is handy because we 've seen that before .
given a couple of clues , i could probably find out a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out .
they 're yes or no , they 're black or white .
truth is never binary . truth is a value .
i was born in 1976 .
i grew up in a traditional mexican family .
what i 'm about to say , at least some of what i 'm about to say , will cause controversy .
but it 's imperative that we listen because it 's undeniable and definitive .
it will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons .
what we do n't agree on is what the problem actually is .
i think none of these is the problem .
the real problem we have is most of us mexicans , we believe we are victims of our circumstances .
historically , we 've always acted as victims of something or somebody .
then we were victims of don porfirio .
then we were victims of the pri .
even of salinas .
and of el peje .
hold on ! wait a minute !
it 's like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it 's the flu and it will just go away .
we need to move mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response , which is , effectively , recognition .
and that recognition will sow fear — recognizing the seriousness of the situation .
but , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
we 're very afraid .
let 's think about mexican streets : they 're unsafe because of violence , so people stay at home .
we go from fear to courage .
`` they say , `` '' i ca n't take it anymore . ''
it 's pacific , coordinated civil action , which does n't mean passive action .
there are examples of this kind of action in mexico .
two years ago , in galena city , chihuahua , a member of the community was kidnapped , eric le barón .
in the end , benjamín and julián decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .
they mobilized the whole community of le barón to go to chihuahua , where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city .
`` we 'll be waiting for you right here . '' '' they stayed there . ''
but he keeps fighting .
i think anyone who has stepped foot on this land — not to mention all mexican people — will agree that it 's not difficult to love mexico .
what are we going to do ?
where is the soldier in each son ?
we need gandhis .
we need men and women who love mexico and who are willing to take action .
but we are many more .
but no one can kill the spirit of true mexicans .
the battle is won , but we still have to fight it .
2000 years ago , the roman poet juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true mexican .
i spoke to drugsheaven .
let 's take the payment system .
so the internet is about to get more interesting , more exciting , more innovative , more terrible , more destructive .
that was awkward .
i just totally transformed what you thought of me , in six seconds .
i am on this stage because i am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry , we call that a sexy girl .
and first , i commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
and i 'm insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day .
but when they were a bit older , they took a little agency and decided to engage .
even though we 've identified the gaps , the whole class will then move on to the next subject , probably a more advanced subject that 's going to build on those gaps .
but what was really broken was the process .
`` and this is n't even just a `` '' nice to have . '' '' i think it 's a social imperative . ''
and i do n't think that this is utopian .
well there 's always the hole .
and then it 's inflated with this low-pressure air .
and then it 's restrained with the cables .
and we said , well the first erection would take one week .
i could n't understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
i was told i was dyslexic .
and so concern is where all of this comes from .
and then , being an actor , i was doing these different kinds of things , and i felt the content of the work that i was involved in really was n't cutting it , that there surely had to be more .
maybe i can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference .
maybe there 's a little change i can get involved in .
because it 's obviously incredibly frightening .
is the destruction of the world inevitable ? should i have children ?
and that was when i had the idea .
that might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces — if we did it just for a day .
i was living at my mom 's place .
and we started writing letters to everybody .
he was a prisoner of war .
he saw the bomb go off at nagasaki .
and that 's why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace .
and we started to build this case .
and of course we did n't have the money ; we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [ this mail ] .
`` and i rang sir bob ayling , who was ceo of ba at the time , and said , `` '' mate , we 've got this invitation . ''
`` could you give me a flight ? because we 're going to go see him . '' '' and of course , we went and saw him and it was amazing . ''
and then dr. oscar arias came forward .
so anyway , we began the journey .
i 'm cutting my hair , it 's getting short and long , because every time i saw kofi annan , i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i cut it , and that was kind of what was going on .
( laughter ) yeah , i 'm not worried about it now .
the fact is that , if i tried and it did n't work , then i could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite — until , it was in somalia , picking up that young girl .
i do n't know how to get involved in that process .
and then on the seventh of september , i was invited to new york .
the costa rican government and the british government had put forward to the united nations general assembly , with 54 co-sponsors , the idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day , the 21st of september , as a fixed calendar date , and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world .
that was an incredible moment .
and as i mentioned , when it started , we were at the globe , and there was no press .
kofi annan invited me on the morning of september the 11th to do a press conference .
and i was waiting for him to come down , and i knew that he was on his way .
the world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence .
and it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives , there and then subsequently all over the world .
it never happened .
`` and i remember thinking , `` '' this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder . ''
and i felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did , then maybe we would n't see things like that .
i remember putting that film out and going to cynics .
it 's just symbolism .
`` they can unite . they can come together . if people would stop , lives will be saved . '' '' that 's what i 'd heard . ''
and i 'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about .
and after lots and lots of meetings obviously , i 'm delighted that this man , ahmad fawzi , one of my heroes and mentors really , he managed to get unicef involved .
it was historical . could it work in afghanistan with unama and who and civil society , etc. , etc. , etc . ?
`` and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it , and i was thinking , `` '' this is it . this is the possibility of it maybe working . ''
`` so jude said , `` '' okay , i 'll do some statements for you . '' '' while i was filming these statements , he said to me , `` '' where are you going next ? '' '' i said , `` '' i 'm going to go to afghanistan . '' '' he said , `` '' really ? '' '' and i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest . ''
it 'd be really interesting if you came .
and actually i could never raise awareness by myself , no matter what i 'd achieved .
i mean , we basically sat down with everybody — in and out of schools with ministers of education , holding these press conferences , which of course , now were loaded with press , everybody was there .
this amazing woman , fatima gailani , was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians .
and then suddenly , i obviously knew at this point , there was a chance .
they were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it , etc. , etc . — and they made it real .
70 percent reduction in violence — in what everyone said was completely impossible and you could n't do .
and that made me think that , if we can get 70 percent in afghanistan , then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere .
we have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce , go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities , both domestically and internationally , ever recorded .
and on the 21st of september this year , we 're going to launch that campaign at the o2 arena to go for that process , to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities .
and we will utilize all kinds of things — have a dance and social media and visiting on facebook and visit the website , sign the petition .
and we 'll globally link with government , inter-government , non-government , education , unions , sports .
and you can see the education box there .
we 've got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce .
`` ultimately , that 's what it 's about . '' '' why do n't we all team up ? why do n't we bring truce to life ? ''
we 'll utilize sport and football .
i was with brahimi , ambassador brahimi .
`` and i said to him , `` '' mr. brahimi , is this nuts , going for a global truce ? ''
it 's all about partnerships .
it 's about your constituencies ; it 's about your businesses .
by working together , we can create peace one day .
thank you ted . thank you .
thank you very much . thank you .
salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate .
that 's exactly what you see here .
very similar to what we just did , but a little bit more complex .
you now have your fully seeded scaffold .
and on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered .
and you can just look at the headlines .
they do n't own those facilities .
even if they did their jobs , and they cited those facilities for their violations , the fine would be derisory .
around 1850 , one of the biggest u.s. industries was whaling .
the question is , who will make them ?
and that costs on average under 18 dollars a barrel .
for example , we use a lot of carbon-fiber composites in sporting goods .
the plant also gets smaller .
the same for gps .
it will recalibrate what 's most important in your life .
i had tears rolling down my cheeks .
harry butler is a precursor , if you like , to the late steve irwin .
when i asked him about what the solution to the problem might be , the answer was quite surprising .
is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to consider and define ?
i wanted to test this idea .
and we did three key things .
we did that genetically and we did that anatomically .
but the acid test is always going to be , how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes .
cheers , mate .
cheers .
and this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals .
because every generation thinks we are the final one .
it 's ok. you start to be in the territory of intelligence , we can say .
but sometimes , like today , we fall , we fall so fast , so fast to shadow , we fall so fast to barbaria .
because it 's not , the barbaria we have today , it 's perhaps not the barbaria we think .
and you can fall , and it 's very dangerous .
science , science has allowed us to know so much about the far reaches of the universe , which is at the same time tremendously important and extremely remote , and yet much , much closer , much more directly related to us , there are many things we do n't really understand .
but first , what do we call complexity ?
well , complex is not complicated .
on the opposite , a complex system is made of many , many similar parts , and it is their interaction that produces a globally coherent behavior .
but from aristotle , let 's move onto a more concrete example of complex systems .
it requires physicists who work with biologists , with mathematicians and computer scientists , and it is their interaction that produces cross-boundary competence to solve these problems .
so again , the whole is greater than the sum of the parts .
in a way , collaboration is another example of a complex system .
in fact , it 's a little different , and to explain , i need to tell you a short story about myself .
it was very , very complicated , but it worked beautifully in our test room , and on demo day , professors had assembled to grade the project .
it turned out , the light in that room was slightly different .
the robot 's vision system got confused .
and i decided that , in fact , i did n't really want to create complicated stuff .
they are very social animals .
mostly they roost , or sleep , together .
and they live in maternity colonies , which means that every spring , the females meet after the winter hibernation , and they stay together for about six months to rear their young , and they all carry a very small chip , which means that every time one of them enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes , we know where she is , and more importantly , we know with whom she is .
okay ? so that 's what this picture looks like .
in this network , all the circles are nodes , individual bats , and the lines between them are social bonds , associations between individuals .
we call them cryptic social units .
with a brain the size of a peanut , they maintain individualized , long-term social bonds , we did n't know that was possible .
what the model told us is that , in a nutshell , each bat knows a few other colony members as her friends , and is just slightly more likely to roost in a box with them .
this is all it takes to explain the social complexity of these bats .
what we know is that the bats are not aware that their colony is doing this .
they live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy .
in the middle of the reserve which they live in lies a road .
on this road there are cars , so it 's dangerous .
it 's a simplistic model .
when the dominant female gives way to a subordinate , it 's not out of courtesy .
so this behavior of risk avoidance is a very old evolutionary response .
in the end , it may be bats which change their social structure in response to a population crash , or it may be meerkats who show a novel adaptation to a human road , or it may be another species .
nicolas perony : i 'm okay , thanks .
thank you , nicolas perony .
chris anderson : william , hi . good to see you .
ca : where ? what country ?
ca : five years ago you had an idea . what was that ?
ca : a windmill ?
ca : so what did you do ? how did you realize that ?
and i tried , and i made it .
ca : the book had three , yours had four .
wk : yeah .
wk : i made four blades , just because i want to increase power .
ca : you tested three , and found that four worked better ?
ca : and what did you make the windmill out of ?
wk : when the wind blows , it rotates and generates .
wk : four bulbs and two radios .
ca : wow .
wk : yeah .
ca : and so what 's your — what are you going to do with this ?
wk : yeah , i want to build another one — to pump water and irrigation for crops .
ca : so this one would have to be bigger ?
ca : how big ?
we create financial markets that are super complex .
maybe it 's actually us that 's designed badly .
here 's felix , i think . he 's our alpha male ; he 's a kind of big guy .
do the monkeys do anything like this ?
for a big bonus , now they get three .
we make things grow .
there were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion .
it was less than i would pay for a bar of chocolate at home .
his dream was to be a teacher .
but of course , life is hard under a military dictatorship , and so for now , this was the only way he could make a living .
and finally he extracted a box .
inside it was every single letter he had ever received from visitors from abroad , and on some of them he had pasted little black-and-white worn snapshots of his new foreign friends .
at home , it 's dangerously easy to assume we 're on top of things .
out in the world , you are reminded every moment that you 're not , and you ca n't get to the bottom of things , either .
i do n't believe that ignorance is bliss .
science has unquestionably made our lives brighter and longer and healthier .
but when a mathematician tells me that minus three times minus three makes nine , that 's a kind of logic that almost feels like trust .
the opposite of knowledge , in other words , is n't always ignorance .
and in my life , i 've found it 's the things i do n't know that have lifted me up and pushed me forwards much more than the things i do know .
the nobel prize-winning economist daniel kahneman has spent more than 60 years now researching human behavior , and his conclusion is that we are always much more confident of what we think we know than we should be .
but the minute they began nibbling from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , they fell from their innocence .
they grew embarrassed and fretful , self-conscious .
and now that i 've been there for 28 years , i really could n't tell you very much at all about my adopted home .
knowledge is a priceless gift .
but the illusion of knowledge can be more dangerous than ignorance .
i 've been a full-time writer now for 34 years .
the first is collaboration .
and everywhere , our institutions are becoming naked .
now , by buff i mean , you need to have good value , because value is evidenced like never before .
and we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world .
so we need to think differently about intellectual property .
i mean , we 're not putting this one back .
the open world is bringing empowerment and freedom .
now , what i 'd like to do is , to close , to share with you some research that i 've been doing .
i 've tried to study all kinds of organizations to understand what the future might look like , but i 've been studying nature recently .
but the choice that we do n't have is a no climate change future .
but dangerous climate change can be subjective .
most of our planet is actually made up of the sea .
there are quite a lot of my colleagues and other scientists who would say that it 's now too late to avoid a two-degree warming .
the other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy .
there are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise .
let me just put that into context .
alice bows-larkin : yeah , it 's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees .
grave 9 , though , matched the family of sergio saul linares .
six .
and go to countries like haiti and the congo .
well , guess what ?
what characterizes them is decentralized authority .
you do n't have to ask permission , as you do in a property-based system .
it 's creating , and it 's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition .
thank you .
it 's never too late to become someone other than simply a survivor .
people were taking care of her for a change .
( applause )
youtube , they 're putting this thing on youtube .
i started to imagine what this would look like .
designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3d , and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen .
what we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies .
students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion , physics , and unlike computer screens or textbooks , this is a real , tangible experience that you can touch and feel , and it 's very powerful .
today , we started by talking about the boundary , but if we remove this boundary , the only boundary left is our imagination .
we 've seen it in the financial crisis . we 've seen it in the pandemic flu .
i do n't live there .
i 'm not as bad a shot as i thought i might have been .
what i learned from north idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around .
in georgia , i stayed in an exurb north of atlanta .
the reality is that many white americans are affable and kind .
thank you .
nature 's my muse and it 's been my passion .
but five years ago , i went on a personal journey .
but there were also revelations .
i went down to a remote lagoon in australia , hoping to see the earth the way it was three billion years ago , back before the sky turned blue .
there 's stromatolites down there — the first living things to capture photosynthesis — and it 's the only place they still occur today .
the oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites is what we all breathe today .
solidifying into surface , molded by fire .
heat from within made geysers erupt — that is how the oceans were born .
growing living structures under an alien sky ...
stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen .
life hardened and became defensive .
vision was refined in horseshoe crabs , among the first to leave the sea .
life turned hard so it could venture inland .
forests arose and nurtured things with wings .
in birds , life gained new mobility .
in africa , gondwana molded proteas .
co-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever .
but there were witnesses , survivors in the dark .
new forms became bats . civets .
new predators , hyenas , getting faster and faster still .
so who are we ? brothers of masculine chimps , sisters of feminine bonobos ? we are all of them , and more .
the blood veins in our hands echoed a course of water traces on the earth .
and where water is liquid , it becomes a womb for cells green with chlorophyll — and that molecular marvel is what 's made a difference — it powers everything .
this earth is alive , and it 's made its own membrane .
and you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next .
( applause ) thank you . thank you .
chris anderson : perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country .
usually not more than two kilometers in width .
later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally .
and of course that 's a highly competitive space .
i mean , if you 're collecting millions of data points on a decision you 're going to make , then you should be able to make a pretty good decision .
many of you will ...
and i find that a very encouraging message , in fact , that even in the face of huge amounts of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you 're doing and take risks .
thank you .
it was then i read the testimony that abed gave the morning after the crash , of driving down the right lane of a highway toward jerusalem .
we looked down at his laminated mug .
i told him only that he had killed one man , not two .
and you walk around , and it points to things .
so there is a danger to pseudoscience , in believing in this sort of thing .
it is the default option . we just believe .
`` so like fox mulder on `` '' x-files , '' '' who wants to believe in ufos ? well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains . ''
in fact , what skinner discovered is that , if you put a pigeon in a box like this , and he has to press one of these two keys , and he tries to figure out what the pattern is , and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there — if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern , they will figure out any kind of pattern .
and that 's called superstition , and that , i 'm afraid , we will always have with us .
well , if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it 's just the wind , you 've made an error in cognition , made a type i error , false positive .
but no harm . you just move away .
this is the only equation in the talk by the way .
it 's a horse head , that 's right .
it looks like a horse . it must be a horse .
and is it really a horse ?
yes , there it is . and there 's the prime .
so when i go back without the prime , your brain already has the model so you can see it again .
what do you see here ?
that 's a good audience , chris .
because there 's nothing in this . well , allegedly there 's nothing .
for example , baseball players are notoriously superstitious when they 're batting , but not so much when they 're fielding .
so their superstitions , their patternicities , are all associated with feelings of lack of control and so forth .
what do you see in this particular one here , in this field ?
here is what you show subjects .
an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine .
they 're incorrect patterns . they 're false positives . they 're type i errors .
in fact , i saw robin williams recently talk about how he thought he was much funnier when he was doing cocaine , when he had that issue , than now .
if you 're too skeptical , you 'll miss the really interesting good ideas .
every time somebody looks at you , you think people are staring at you .
it 's a distinction perhaps we might make between two nobel laureates , richard feynman and john nash .
one sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a nobel prize .
and we then call that schizophrenia .
again , i 'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here , causing you conflicting pattern detections .
you know , of course , this is via uno shoes .
you see a dolphin here , and there 's a dolphin , and there 's a dolphin .
if you look down here , it 's fine . if you look up here , then you get conflicting data .
`` so you say , `` '' aw , come on shermer , anybody can do that in a psych 101 text with an illusion like that . '' '' well here 's the late , great jerry andrus ' `` '' impossible crate '' '' illusion in 3d , in which jerry is standing inside the impossible crate . ''
this is a fairly new one that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns of comparing this angle with that angle .
here 's some faces on the side of a rock .
now , they trade up the politicians every time .
and there 's two types of cells that do this , that record facial features either globally , or specifically these large , rapid-firing cells , first look at the general face .
so you recognize obama immediately .
and then you notice something quite a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth .
and i call this process agenticity .
that is the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning , intention and agency , often invisible beings from the top down .
so it 's a type of that expanded to explain , i think , a lot of different things : souls , spirits , ghosts , gods , demons , angels , aliens , intelligent designers , government conspiracists and all manner of invisible agents with power and intention , are believed to haunt our world and control our lives .
my favorite one was he was in the manhole .
but of course , lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy .
so we ca n't just uniformly dismiss all patterns like that .
some conspiracies really are true .
explains a lot , maybe .
we did a whole issue on it .
`` but that 's not what the `` '' 9/11 truthers '' '' think . ''
well , that 's a whole other lecture .
i 'm going to ask you to go ahead and put a blindfold on .
woman : take a step here .
okay , now i 'm going to ask you to pucker up .
pucker up big and lean in just a little bit , okay ?
spiders are truly global citizens .
on the bottom here , this is the geologic timescale , and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present , so the zero here , that would be today .
all spiders make silk at some point in their life .
most spiders use copious amounts of silk , and silk is essential to their survival and reproduction .
spiders use silk for many purposes , including the trailing safety dragline , wrapping eggs for reproduction , protective retreats and catching prey .
when you look at this orb web , you 're actually seeing many types of silk fibers .
you can see multiple fibers coming out of the spinnerets , because each spinneret has many spigots on it .
spider silk is almost entirely protein .
so for example this would be one sentence , and you would get this sort of green region and the red polyalanine , that repeats over and over and over again , and you can have that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times within an individual silk molecule .
silks made by the same spider can have dramatically different repeat sequences .
now , it 's really convenient that spiders use their silk completely outside their body .
so silk fibers vary in their strength and also their extensibility .
in the case of the capture spiral , it needs to be so stretchy to absorb the impact of flying prey .
some of them are orb-weaving spiders and some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders .
it 's been hypothesized that orb-weaving spiders , like this argiope here , should have the toughest dragline silks because they must intercept flying prey .
the 21 species are indicated here by this phylogeny , this evolutionary tree , that shows their genetic relationships , and i 've colored in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders .
if you look right here at the two red arrows , they point to the toughness values for the draglines of nephila clavipes and araneus diadematus .
yet , their draglines are not the toughest .
we do n't really know why scytodes needs such a tough dragline , but it 's unexpected results like this that make bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile .
now i 'm going to mark on the toughness values for nylon fiber , bombyx — or domesticated silkworm silk — wool , kevlar , and carbon fibers .
and the strength , extensibility and toughness of spider silks combined with the fact that silks do not elicit an immune response , have attracted a lot of interest in the use of spider silks in biomedical applications , for example , as a component of artificial tendons , for serving as guides to regrow nerves , and for scaffolds for tissue growth .
spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti-ballistic capabilities .
in addition to these biomimetic applications of spider silks , personally , i find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself .
to borrow from the writings of a spider named charlotte , silk is terrific .
actually , it 's a long-standing philosophical debate .
here i 'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient greek cities looked just based on a few bricks , that the writings of a culture are the archaeological records , the fossils , of human thought .
and with this , they gained introspection : the ability to think about their own thoughts .
and the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions , of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection .
`` now , already you may be saying of yourself , `` '' i 'm not intriguing . ''
they spell out the acronym ocean .
`` and `` '' n '' '' — `` '' neurotic individuals , '' '' in contrast to those who are more stable . ''
and so we know that , for example , openness and conscientiousness are very good predictors of life success , but the open people achieve that success through being audacious and , occasionally , odd .
already , some of you have tried to lick the outside of your own elbow .
let me explain .
one of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation .
and i 've seen you .
it may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation .
and so , if you would like me to — yes , you would ?
3.0 .
7.5 .
extroverts prefer black-and-white , concrete , simple language .
introverts prefer — and i must again tell you that i am as extreme an introvert as you could possibly imagine — we speak differently .
when we talk , we sometimes talk past each other .
first , his name is tom .
and michael almost brought the project to a crashing halt .
of course .
are we just a bunch of traits ?
as elizabeth or as george , you may share your extroversion or your neuroticism .
that make us love you ?
`` do n't ask people what type you are ; ask them , `` '' what are your core projects in your life ? '' '' and we enact those free traits . ''
and while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it , all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any browser .
all you do , go into the timeline , double-click the item , and i 've set it to toronto , because that 's where i 'm from .
and it 's exactly the same for the people who watch your production .
so imagine if every video that we watched on the web worked like the web , completely remixable , linked to its source content , and interactive for everyone who views it .
here are two reasons companies fail : they only do more of the same , or they only do what 's new .
consider facit .
facit was a fantastic company .
everybody used them .
gone .
to me , the irony about the facit story is hearing about the facit engineers , who had bought cheap , small electronic calculators in japan that they used to double-check their calculators .
`` they were extremely innovative , and the mantra was , `` '' when we only get it right , '' '' or even , `` '' we want it perfect . '' '' the sad thing is , before they became perfect — even good enough — they became obsolete . ''
it 's about search , it 's about discovery , it 's about new products , it 's about new innovations .
it 's about changing our frontiers .
we all know that exploration is risky .
we do n't know the answers , we do n't know if we 're going to find them , and we know that the risks are high .
it 's about making good products faster and cheaper .
small children , they explore all day .
as we grow older , we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on .
and this is , of course , a big worry to ceos .
and i hear very often questions phrased in different ways .
`` or , `` '' how can i make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis ? '' '' so , doing one well is difficult . ''
but the same goes for that , then we 're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated .
but we do n't only see this in companies .
we see this in the public sector as well .
we all know that any kind of effective reform of education , research , health care , even defense , takes 10 , 15 , maybe 20 years to work .
another trap is the success trap .
we are like that , too .
when we know something well , it 's difficult to change .
so i think there are some lessons , and i think they apply to us .
but it 's difficult , and we need to be conscious .
i want to just point out two questions that i think are useful .
second question is : when did i explore something new last , and what kind of effect did it have on me ?
so let me leave you with this .
whether you 're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know , do n't forget : the beauty is in the balance .
now , i want to tell you about the yap because their form of money is really interesting .
there 's a story about these sailors that were transporting a stone across the ocean when they ran into some trouble and the stone actually fell in .
the point i want to make with these two examples is that there 's nothing inherently valuable about a dollar or a stone or a coin .
it 's about a collective story that we tell each other about value .
now when this works , it 's because there are large institutions underwriting every 1 or 0 that changes on a computer .
and a lot of times , they do n't .
the same thing happens when institutions control the money supply .
in an analog world , we had to deal with these physical objects , and money moved at a certain speed — the speed of humans .
we 're about to enter a new phase of money .
when we combine software and currency , money becomes more than just a static unit of value , and we do n't have to rely on institutions for security .
and when this happens , we wo n't even feel like we 're transacting anymore .
money will be directed by software , and it will just safely and securely flow .
it 's money designed to work in a world without intermediaries .
cryptocurrencies are based on a special field of mathematics called cryptography .
cryptography underpins so many of the systems around us .
today , anyone with a modern web browser is running a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem .
so what the banks used to give us — trustworthy digital money transfer — we can now get with a clever application of cryptography .
in bitcoin , i spend by transferring bitcoin , and i get paid when someone transfers bitcoin to me .
imagine that we had this magic paper .
and i can look at mine and i 'll have a list of all of the transfers that are happening in the entire bitcoin economy .
except , it 's not done through paper .
but where do bitcoins actually come from ?
imagine that we had 15 dice , and we were throwing these dice over and over again .
and when they do , we say that they 've solved the puzzle .
there are actually people all over the world running this software , and we call them bitcoin miners .
so , the first set of cryptocurrencies are a little bit slow and a little bit cumbersome .
cryptocurrencies are the first step to a world with a global programmable money .
and i can send money around the world .
imagine a world where i can rent out my healthcare data to a pharmaceutical company .
we 're not at this world yet , but it 's coming .
the first cryptocurrency , like the first car , is slow and hard to understand and hard to use .
all new technology comes with trade-offs .
the internet brought us a lot of ways to waste time .
the new sharing economy is going to eliminate some jobs .
but it 's also going to create new , flexible forms of employment .
and because of this , things are going to change and unfold in ways that we ca n't even predict .
hi , kids .
when do we start aging ?
we all feel younger than our real age , because the spirit never ages .
sophia loren . look at her .
but attitude , aging is also attitude and health .
she is always happy and eternally young .
what have i gained ?
freedom : i do n't have to prove anything anymore .
and i 've gained spirituality .
i 'm aware that before , death was in the neighborhood .
and it 's good to start early .
you know , for a vain female like myself , it 's very hard to age in this culture .
she says that there is nothing more sensual than a hot shower , that every drop of water is a blessing to the senses .
she does n't see herself as disabled .
she has been a widow for nine years , but she 's not looking for another mate .
i have been training for some time , and when i feel flat and bored , i fake it .
and i train by trying to stay in love .
jubilation . celebration .
we have paid our dues .
i am working on it every day .
thank you .
so what will you do ? i 'll tell you what i did and why i did it . and i know my time 's up .
dad , being an academic , had no idea that mike 's hard lemonade contained alcohol .
fair enough .
now , how about incentives ?
his employees are inspired by the effort .
they need to learn to respect themselves .
and 100 percent were living below the poverty level .
and if they 're not learning , where would they end up ?
`` we call our students `` '' scholars , '' '' because they 're lifelong learners . ''
( laughter ) but we are all connected to succeed , and good leaders do this .
thank you .
`` right now there 's a person who can tell an audience to put their hands up in the air and they will stay there till he says , `` put them down . '' ''
and that to me is sad .
i 'm going to paraphrase mark twain .
`` you go to a black church , their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience , so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes , and then he takes a pause , and he says , `` '' oh my gosh , they 're not quite paying attention . '' '' so he says , `` '' can i get an amen ? '' '' audience : amen . ''
he drops his voice at a very , very low volume when he wants people to key into him , and those things are the skills that we need for the most engaging teachers .
at our teacher education classes at my university , i 've started a project where every single student that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts .
well , they orient to the caregiver .
it does n't ; it begins with the beginning of life .
how do we enter that feeling of resonance , how do we enter another person 's being ?
and there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
the stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter .
it was an amazing sort of insight for me .
anyway , another interesting thing happened while i was there .
that 's a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
there are many science-based analyses of this , but they all draw the same conclusion — that we 're living beyond our means .
the eminent scientists of the global footprint network , for example , calculate that we need about 1.5 earths to sustain this economy .
in other words , to keep operating at our current level , we need 50 percent more earth than we 've got .
in financial terms , this would be like always spending 50 percent more than you earn , going further into debt every year .
so when i say full , i mean really full — well past any margin for error , well past any dispute about methodology .
what this means is our economy is unsustainable .
what i 'm saying is our approach is simply unsustainable .
but that 's not possible , you might think .
we ca n't stop economic growth .
technology is amazing . people are innovative .
well , it 's mostly true .
we are certainly amazing , and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity .
so if our problem was to get the human economy down from 150 percent to 100 percent of the earth 's capacity , we could do that .
we plan to take this highly-stressed economy and make it twice as big and then make it four times as big — not in some distant future , but in less than 40 years , in the life time of most of you .
china plans to be there in just 20 years .
in response , some people argue , but we need growth , we need it to solve poverty .
this is about food and water , soil and climate , the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives .
and that 's what will happen to us .
many of you will be thinking , but surely we can still stop this .
if it 's that bad , we 'll react .
i could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this , but i wo n't because , if you want to see it , that evidence is all around you .
i want to do so because , in my view , the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question .
but let 's just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen .
now imagine what that means for you , your family , your friends , your personal financial security .
imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen .
perhaps anger .
maybe fear .
of course , we ca n't know what 's going to happen and we have to live with uncertainty .
that 's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on , because if we wait until the crisis takes hold , we may panic and hide .
if we feel it now and think it through , we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself .
think about war .
think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy .
and how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that ?
there 's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way .
scientists like james hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net co2 emissions from the economy in just a few decades .
to my surprise , eliminating net co2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap , not very cheap , but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization .
you can read the details , but in summary , we can transform our economy .
we can do it at an affordable cost .
and this is where you come in .
we need to accept the fear and then we need to act .
we need to act like the future depends on it .
i know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth , more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do .
this could be our finest hour .
you lose the institutional imperative .
there 's a wonderful , small example going on right now .
we can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge .
and here is an example .
but networks are not just a scientific metaphor .
it 's a set of concentric geodesic structures with linkages between each one .
wish us luck .
okay , just like the movies .
one , 3d printing takes forever .
at the bottom of the reservoir is a special window .
it 's got characteristics like a contact lens .
the result is pretty staggering .
you always take the risk that something like this wo n't work onstage , right ?
and subtractive techniques from the silicon industry ca n't do that very well .
so that 's just forming some body stuff , right ?
woo hoo ! ( applause ) it takes me back to the summer of 2011 .
my family , my kids had all grown up .
jenn , my daughter , and my son-in-law came down from new york .
we 're at the playoff game , pete 's at the plate , and a fastball 's coming in , and it hits him on the wrist .
oh , pete .
his wrist went completely limp , like this .
`` six months later , in march , he called my husband and me , and he said , `` '' oh , mom and dad , we have a doctor that found a diagnosis for that wrist . ''
`` so at the end of their talk , the panel , they had questions and answers , and boom , my hand went right up , and i get the microphone , and i look at them and i say , `` '' thank you . ''
thus my mission had begun .
we were supposed to have therapies overseas , and the rug was pulled out from under us .
today , pete 's completely paralyzed .
he 's confined to a motorized wheelchair .
he has a feeding tube .
over the next couple of days , our news feed was full of family and friends .
you 've got to see uncle artie 's human bloody mary .
so week one , boston media .
how about the redemption nuns of dublin ?
angela merkel , the chancellor of germany .
als tdi in cambridge , they raised three million dollars .
well , guess what ?
goal number one , check .
now on to the treatment and cure .
you 'll see the kids , they 're up there hanging it up .
( applause ) thank you . ( applause )
be hardworking .
the game is rigged .
the choices are terrible .
it was street theater , open-air debates , fasting and feasting and toasting , parades and bonfires .
a few decades later , the suffragettes brought a spirit of theatricality to their fight , marching together in white dresses as they claimed the franchise .
in india , elections are colorful , communal affairs .
in taiwan and hong kong , there is a spectacle , eye-popping , eye-grabbing spectacle to the street theater of elections .
well , how do we make this happen ?
in akron , it means political plays being performed in the bed of a flatbed truck that moves from neighborhood to neighborhood .
in philadelphia , it 's a voting-themed scavenger hunt all throughout colonial old town .
he got himself registered , and then he got educated about the upcoming primary election , and on election day he was out there not just passing out stickers , but chatting up voters and encouraging people to vote , and talking about the election with passersby .
in akron , a theater company called the wandering aesthetics has been putting on these pickup truck plays .
i want to read to you from this poem .
i used to be afraid of ghosts .
it 's about this passion .
it 's about feeling and belief , and it is n't just our organization 's work .
voting matters because it is a self-fulfilling act of belief .
when we vote , even if it is in anger , we are part of a collective , creative leap of faith .
it is a matter of spirit .
because there is no such thing as not voting .
i invite you to imagine 100 percent .
we have to make purpose .
let 's vote this revolution into existence , and while we 're at it , let 's have some fun .
it was fantastic .
but my colleagues did n't know .
anas aremeyaw anas : this was another story on anticorruption .
i have been undercover in the prisons .
and i can tell you , what i saw is not nice .
she had 14 children .
now , these caves contain some of the oldest cave paintings in the world .
not only that , but some really bad scientists want to do some experiments on him , and they 're looking for him .
so the children have a plot .
and i turn to caroline , and she 's crying her eyes out .
and this is common .
and then when he 's finished with ophelia , he turns on his mum , because basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle and enjoy sex .
and i want to ask you : do you believe that ?
and remember this : that in a sense , if we 're going to get past this moment of a world where we know that we are unequal , it 's artists who have to imagine a different world .
they bury their dead . they educate the next of kin .
it 's called the blockchain . blockchain .
now , it 's not the most sonorous word in the world , but i believe that this is now the next generation of the internet , and that it holds vast promise for every business , every society and for all of you , individually .
this is democratized information .
it can take a second for an email to go around the world , but it can take days or weeks for money to move through the banking system across a city .
what if there were a native medium for value ?
and that 's of greater interest .
so for the first time now in human history , people everywhere can trust each other and transact peer to peer .
so if i wanted to go and hack a block and , say , pay you and you with the same money , i 'd have to hack that block , plus all the preceding blocks , the entire history of commerce on that blockchain , not just on one computer but across millions of computers , simultaneously , all using the highest levels of encryption , in the light of the most powerful computing resource in the world that 's watching me .
this is infinitely more secure than the computer systems that we have today .
recognize this ?
it 's a ridiculously complicated machine that does something really simple , like crack an egg or shut a door .
i mean , you tap your card in the corner store , and a bitstream goes through a dozen companies , each with their own computer system , some of them being 1970s mainframes older than many of the people in this room , and three days later , a settlement occurs .
now , why should you care ?
well , let me describe some applications .
this creates the conditions for prosperity for potentially billions of people .
this is a very powerful idea , that peers can come together and create and share wealth .
my view is that ...
this is 600 billion dollars a year , and it 's growing , and these people are getting ripped off .
it takes five hours out of her week to do this .
six months ago , analie domingo used a blockchain application called abra .
and data is really a new asset class , maybe bigger than previous asset classes , like land under the agrarian economy , or an industrial plant , or even money .
and all of you — we — create this data .
musicians are left with crumbs at the end of the whole food chain .
it 's free , or maybe a few micro-cents that flow into a digital account .
( applause )
that is how our women dress .
so our economy is small , but here is where it gets interesting .
today , our culture is flourishing .
so today , the clean energy that we export offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood .
you see , the world is getting warmer , and climate change is a reality .
climate change is affecting my country .
it 's stunning .
just 20 years ago , that lake did n't exist .
that 's why we have promised to remain carbon neutral .
last december in paris , at cop 21 , we reiterated our promise to remain carbon neutral for all time to come .
all countries , from the very small to the very large , committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions .
it 's crucial that all of us keep our commitments .
we are providing free electricity to our rural farmers .
is n't that awesome ?
we must keep our parks awesome .
over the next few years , our small economy wo n't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment .
we are almost there .
naturally , i 'm pretty excited .
whew , it is getting warm in here .
building is at the heart of the experience : hands on , deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand .
and the things that they build amaze even themselves .
video : yay !
do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them . i know they could .
it is absolutely possible .
and you know something about a lousy school ?
right ? ( laughter ) where you say , like , '87 was like a good year , right ?
one size fits all , if you get it , fine , and if you do n't , tough luck . just tough luck .
do not tell me we ca n't do better than this .
who created that business model ? right ?
it was n't about the customers .
it was about bankers . they created something that worked for them .
and they do n't care whether or not geoff is upset he ca n't go to the bank . go find another bank .
they all operate the same way . right ?
now , one day , some crazy banker had an idea .
`` i am never using that , right ? '' '' so technology has changed . things have changed . ''
yet not in education . why ?
why is it that when we had rotary phones , when we were having folks being crippled by polio , that we were teaching the same way then that we 're doing right now ?
it says exactly the same thing : poor kids lose ground in the summertime .
you know , i always wonder , who makes up those rules ?
i thought i knew something .
you plant them in the spring .
how many places in america are going to change ? none .
yes , there 'll be some place , because some folks will do the right thing .
we know that the problem begins immediately .
we did n't know how critical those first three years were .
we did n't know the role that language , a stimulus and response , call and response , how important that was in developing those children .
wealthy people know . educated people know .
poor kids need that experience .
nope . lots of places , it does n't exist .
you know , we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about , you know , because i 'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff , but we do health services , and i have to raise a lot of money .
so here 's the other thing .
i 'm a tester guy . i believe you need data , you need information , because you work at something , you think it 's working , and you find out it 's not working .
but here 's the problem with testing .
you go on vacation . ( laughter ) you come back from vacation .
why would you look at it ?
i need to know you 're struggling , and i need to know whether or not what i did corrected that .
i do n't need to know that at the end of the year when it 's too late .
because in my older years , i 've become somewhat of a clairvoyant .
i can predict school scores .
and you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids were on grade level .
we ca n't stifle innovation in our business .
we have to innovate . and people in our business get mad about innovation .
this stuff has n't worked for 55 years .
let 's try something different . and here 's the rub .
but we ca n't confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we should n't therefore do anything .
`` every time something did n't work , we just threw in the towel and said , `` '' let 's forget it . '' '' right ? ''
you know , they convinced me . i 'm sure some of you were like me — the latest and greatest thing , the palmpilot .
our job as educators , there 's some stuff we know that we can do .
i dare say it 's a pittance , what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems .
geoffrey canada : well , you know , john , 100 percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school .
gc : well , you know , one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids , the same kids , these same vulnerable kids , when you get them in school , they drop out in record numbers .
and so we 've figured out that you 've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does .
`` they harass you , right ? they call you , they say , `` '' i want to see your grades . how 'd you do on that last test ? ''
but you have everything you need .
within a few decades , millions will have the capability to misuse rapidly advancing biotech , just as they misuse cybertech today .
for instance , there are some eco-extremists who think that it would be better for the planet , for gaia , if there were far fewer humans .
what happens when such people have mastered synthetic biology techniques that will be widespread by 2050 ?
and just to see the world trade center from bujold 's viewpoint , look at this .
it 's not making them more heat-resistant .
probably , like , none .
so it 's the data .
everybody can see the data .
it 's about the data .
but this is quite good .
insects are animals that walk around on six legs .
what do they do ?
they remove dung , they pollinate our crops .
small animals eat insects .
but the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals , still larger animals .
if they do n't have any damage , they go to the grocery .
in fact , why would we put these balls in the soup , there 's meat in there anyway ?
( laughter ) in fact , all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of .
`` now you may say , `` okay , so we 're eating 500 grams just by accident . '' ''
one gram of gold is 30 euros .
that means that we have a lot more mouths to feed , and this is something that worries more and more people .
in china in the last 20 years , it increased from 20 to 50 , and it 's still increasing .
they 're even models in medicine , and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human .
and a pig disease , a pig virus , and a human virus can both proliferate , and because of their kind of reproduction , they can combine and produce a new virus .
( laughter ) and there 's the conversion factor .
so that 's three points for insects .
well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein , or fat , or vitamins , it 's very good .
so that 's four points for insects .
so the question is , why not eat insects ?
and if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent , we 're not going to make it that way .
on the left-hand side , you see a market in laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night .
you can vary enormously .
it has many benefits .
well that 's just a matter of mindset .
there are entrepreneurs in the netherlands that produce them , and one of them is here in the audience , marian peeters , who 's in the picture .
i predict that later this year , you 'll get them in the supermarkets — not visible , but as animal protein in the food .
a dutch chocolate maker .
( music ) ( applause ) so there 's even a lot of design to it .
you should try it yourself .
so you can try it yourself today , and i would say , enjoy .
bg : that 's exactly the same [ one ] you saw in the video actually .
when the havasupai found out , they sued successfully for $ 700,000 , and they banned asu from conducting research on their reservation .
and if we do n't do something soon , the gap in health disparities is going to continue to widen .
what if you could fit a genome sequencer in your pocket ?
it does n't have the same physical limitations , in that it 's not tethered to a lab bench with extraneous cords , large vats of chemicals or computer monitors .
indigenomics is about science for the people by the people .
( applause )
and second , that language is one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world .
and in my little corner of the world , these two things are actually related , and i want to tell you how tonight .
keep your hands up if you wanted an operation .
but if you have to have an operation , what you really want is a minimally invasive operation .
let me tell you , surgeons are not born .
it starts with a foundation , basic skills .
we build on that and we take people , hopefully , to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant .
if you need surgery , you want to be operated on by a board-certified surgeon .
you get your board certificate , and you can go out into practice .
now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the american board of surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified .
so to lift this education and training worldwide is a very large task , something i 'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world .
sages does surgery all over the world , teaching and educating surgeons .
and one of the tools i like personally is using video .
it 's the primary harvard medical school teaching facility .
we have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages , and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital .
if you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients — not just teaching surgeons , just trying to talk to your patients — there are n't enough translators in the world .
we need to employ technology to assist us in this quest .
and there is n't always a translator available .
we need a universal translator .
one of the things that i want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world .
maybe we have something to learn as well .
`` and everywhere i go the barrier is : `` we want this , but we need it in our language . '' ''
that 's a tall order . we have to work at it .
so let me show you what we 're doing .
this is research — ca n't buy it .
but we do n't have the words yet , so we add a third technology .
and now we 've got the words , and we can apply the special sauce : the translation .
and we currently have access to eleven language pairs .
module five : manual skills practice .
the difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much .
now go ahead and cut .
we want it to be bi-directional .
( applause )
there is something different ; you can click on it , and if you click on it , you can zoom in on almost any place on the earth .
is that possible ?
can i reconstruct social networks of the past ?
can i make a facebook of the middle ages ?
if we want to build something like google maps of the past , or facebook of the past , we need to enlarge this space , we need to make that like a rectangle .
so , it might not be enough .
so , i can do what historians do .
they 've been keeping track of everything , almost like google today .
the type of objective we want to reach is 450 books a day that can be digitized .
so the solution is actually to take inspiration from another domain : speech recognition .
and these are administrative documents .
and then what you can do is put that in space , because much of this information is spatial .
you can reconstruct that journey , visualize it in many different ways .
we can reconstruct also the journey of the venetian maritime empire , how it progressively controlled the adriatic sea , how it became the most powerful medieval empire of its time , controlling most of the sea routes from the east to the south .
of course , you understand , the central scientific challenge of a project like this one is qualifying , quantifying and representing uncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process .
how can we represent that form of uncertainty ?
it 's difficult . one thing you can do is document each step of the process , not only coding the historical information but what we call the meta-historical information , how is historical knowledge constructed , documenting each step .
that will not guarantee that we actually converge toward a single story of venice , but probably we can actually reconstruct a fully documented potential story of venice .
this is an image from an exhibit which is currently conducted in geneva with that type of system .
when you visit the archivio di stato , you feel this is beyond what any single team can do , and that should be a joint and common effort .
so one day i stayed a little late after school , a little too late , and i lurked in the girls ' bathroom .
all of those a 's . ( laughter ) and i got ready to return the book to the drawer , when hang on , some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too .
i felt great .
i was never caught .
jealousy baffles me .
it 's so mysterious , and it 's so pervasive .
we know primates do . bluebirds are actually very prone .
`` this year is the centennial of his masterpiece , `` '' in search of lost time , '' '' and it 's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness , my brand , that we can hope to have . ( laughter ) and we think about proust , we think about the sentimental bits , right ? ''
we think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea .
we forget how harsh his vision was .
we forget how pitiless he is .
let 's look at why they go so well together , the novel and jealousy , jealousy and proust .
is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
we tell ourselves a story about other people 's lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they 're designed to make us feel terrible .
jealousy makes us all amateur novelists , and this is something proust understood .
but you do n't have to be that jealous to concede that it 's hard work . right ?
`` he says , `` '' you know , look , i know you think this is repugnant , but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument . '' '' he says , `` '' they are scientific investigations with real intellectual value . '' '' proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd , but it is , at its crux , a quest for knowledge , a quest for truth , painful truth , and actually , where proust is concerned , the more painful the truth , the better . ''
`` he says , `` '' a woman whom we need , who makes us suffer , elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us . '' '' is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ? ''
and does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way ?
does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ?
because she 's blameless ; everybody knows it .
[ freud ] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife 's unconscious .
and this is why , i think , jealousy does n't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things .
now i 'm thinking of myself at eight , i concede , but i 'm also thinking of this story i heard on the news .
for a year . a year .
( laughter ) because , i mean , let 's be real .
what immense , if misplaced , creativity . right ?
this is something from a novel .
but what do we do ? we ca n't go the tom ripley route .
does the novel show us a way out ? i 'm not sure .
but i 've always preferred [ inspector ] lestrade , who is the rat-faced head of scotland yard who needs holmes desperately , needs holmes ' genius , but resents him .
oh , it 's so familiar to me .
you know , one minute holmes is on the other side from lestrade .
we are in excellent company .
and when this happens , it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight , which you can see as a dip in this curve .
on this graph on the left-hand side you have the amount of light , and on the bottom is time .
earth , on the other hand , is 11 times smaller than jupiter , and the signal is barely visible in the data .
a few years ago , planet hunters were sifting through data looking for transits , and they spotted a mysterious signal coming from the star kic 8462852 .
they said and object like jupiter would make a drop like this in the star 's light , but they were also saying it was giant .
it also is asymmetric , having a gradual dimming that lasts almost a week , and then it snaps right back up to normal in just a matter of days .
things start to get really crazy .
these dips have variable shapes .
some are very sharp , and some are broad , and they also have variable durations .
this is truly remarkable .
and so at this point , we set out to learn everything we could about the star to see if we could find any clues to what was going on .
and the citizen scientists who helped us in this discovery , they joined along for the ride watching science in action firsthand .
`` now i have to rewrite my paper . '' '' so yes , the natural explanations were weak , and we were curious now . ''
we wrote a proposal to observe the star with the world 's largest radio telescope at the green bank observatory .
and if you search google images , this is what you 'll find .
so they would go and build huge structures .
it 's really hard to provide perspective on the vastness of these things , but you can think of it this way .
you see , anything that uses a lot of energy is going to produce heat , and we do n't observe this .
personally , as a scientist , my money is on the natural explanation .
and i 'm happy to say that once again , citizen scientists have come in and saved the day .
what 's amazing to me is that this star would have never been found by computers because we just were n't looking for something like this .
it sometimes acts without knowing everything it has to know .
but — and it 's a pretty big but — we forget .
now the first part of this that we need to think about and we need to process our existence , our life , immediately and repeatedly .
in between , we want to talk to people about it .
practice for some reason became a very negative thing .
`` i just got through reading `` '' the great gatsby , '' '' and i have a perfect idea of what he looks like in my head , so my own version . ''
everything we do is an approximation of sophistication .
we also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease .
i experienced this firsthand as a high school student in uganda .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , as well as the teachers who taught me , to hiv/aids .
back in the day , computers used to fill this entire room , and people actually used to work inside the computers .
but what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone .
the good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories .
so , right now , we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips .
this is a microfluidic chip that i developed .
thank you very much .
( applause )
if i see it in a game , you 're going to come out and sit on the bench .
and i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside .
( laughter ) and we stop listening .
do that . err on the side of caution .
if they 're talking about having lost a family member , do n't start talking about the time you lost a family member .
when i 'm talking , i 'm in control .
but it 's not that simple .
our global economy stops growing .
growth matters a lot .
this means either more labor or more capital or more productivity .
we hoped it could produce growth .
it will be 25 percent in 10 years .
these robots are working for us right now .
the new manufacturing revolution makes it possible .
it will create a huge macroeconomic shift .
and it is .
we were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son — my husband , orlando , and i and our family .
and when i saw it — and yet , through the shock , the terrible shock , and the terrible explosion in our lives , literally , we were not vengeful .
`` when i saw aicha in the media , coming over when her son was indicted , and i thought , `` '' what a brave woman . ''
and i saw phyllis , and i watched her .
the others were brothers , sisters .
i lost a child when i was 15 , a second child when i was 16 .
it 's up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children .
and what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connected as human beings .
`` who else can i meet that i do n't know , or that i 'm so different from ? '' '' so , aicha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ? ''
because our time is up .
( laughter ) ( translator ) aw : i wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other .
you must be tolerant .
this is what i wanted to say .
( applause )
they are very happy with their balls-and-sticks models of molecules .
here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness of the quantum world .
but in the quantum world , this happens all the time .
it 's almost like magic .
physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness .
and these are reductionist , deterministic chemical reactions , showing that , essentially , life is made of the same stuff as everything else , and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world , then we should be able to forget about it in biology , as well .
in fact , living matter seems to behave in this order , in a structure , just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero , where quantum effects play a very important role .
there 's something special about the structure — the order — inside a living cell .
this is n't speculation , by the way .
the particles fuse together , and the sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling .
one question we asked is whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in dna .
again , this is not a new idea ; it goes all the way back to the early 60s .
one prefers to sit on one side ; the other , on the other side of the two strands of the vertical lines going down , which you ca n't see .
it can happen that these two protons can hop over .
they can jump over to the other side .
quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking .
some years ago , the world of science was shocked when a paper was published showing experimental evidence that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria , carrying out photosynthesis .
it 's also still very speculative , but i have to share it with you .
the european robin migrates from scandinavia down to the mediterranean , every autumn , and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects , they navigate by sensing the earth 's magnetic field .
but i believe it 's built on solid science .
watch this space .
thank you .
well that fundamental sense of oneness is lost on us very quickly .
and that self becomes the vehicle for navigating our social world .
the self changed , got affected , broken , destroyed , but another one would evolve — sometimes stronger , sometimes hateful , sometimes not wanting to be there at all .
i grew up on the coast of england in the '70s .
but nature had its wicked way , and brown babies were born .
but from about the age of five , i was aware that i did n't fit .
because the self likes to fit , to see itself replicated , to belong .
without it , we literally ca n't interface with others .
my hair was n't right .
i would put all my emotional expression into my dancing .
and at 16 , i stumbled across another opportunity , and i earned my first acting role in a film .
by 19 , i was a fully-fledged movie actor , but still searching for definition .
and race is an illegitimate concept which our selves have created based on fear and ignorance .
my desire to disappear was still very powerful .
i still believed my self was all i was .
the self 's struggle for authenticity and definition will never end unless it 's connected to its creator — to you and to me .
for a start , we can think about all the times when we do lose ourselves .
i 'm earthed in my essence , and my self is suspended .
and when i 'm acting a role , i inhabit another self , and i give it life for awhile , because when the self is suspended so is divisiveness and judgment .
and i honestly believe the key to my success as an actor and my progress as a person has been the very lack of self that used to make me feel so anxious and insecure .
i always wondered why i could feel others ' pain so deeply , why i could recognize the somebody in the nobody .
i take it to therapy .
so here 's a note to self : the cracks have started to show in our constructed world , and oceans will continue to surge through the cracks , and oil and blood , rivers of it .
only we 're not living with each other ; our crazy selves are living with each other and perpetuating an epidemic of disconnection .
let 's live with each other and take it a breath at a time .
and it turns out there is only one solution to fight a much stronger enemy .
when i was him back then , i was approached by j. walter thompson , the ad company , and they were hired sort of by the sundance channel .
and i was initially resistant , because i always think poetry can stand alone by itself .
but i relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility , and also i 'm like a total cartoon junkie since childhood .
when i was poet laureate , there i go again — i ca n't help it , it 's true — ( laughter ) i created a poetry channel on delta airlines that lasted for a couple of years .
so let us start with the first one .
( applause ) writing is not actually as easy as that for me .
poetry just says a few things in different ways .
`` and i think you could boil this poem down to saying , `` some days you eat the bear , other days the bear eats you . '' ''
all afternoon they face one another , the man in the brown suit , the woman in the blue dress — perfectly motionless , perfectly behaved .
and the poem begins with a certain species of forgetfulness that someone called literary amnesia , in other words , forgetting the things that you have read .
`` ( video ) narration : `` '' forgetfulness . '' '' the name of the author is the first to go , followed obediently by the title , the plot , the heartbreaking conclusion , the entire novel , which suddenly becomes one you have never read , never even heard of . ''
long ago , you kissed the names of the nine muses good-bye and you watched the quadratic equation pack its bag .
`` ( applause ) bc : the next poem is called `` '' the country '' '' and it 's based on , when i was in college i met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine . ''
and we would visit each other .
and when i would go up to the country , he would teach me things like deer hunting , which meant getting lost with a gun basically — ( laughter ) and trout fishing and stuff like that .
who could whisk away the thought of the one unlikely mouse padding along a cold water pipe behind the floral wallpaper , gripping a single wooden match between the needles of his teeth ?
who could not see him rounding a corner , the blue tip scratching against rough-hewn beam , the sudden flare and the creature , for one bright , shining moment , suddenly thrust ahead of his time — now a fire-starter , now a torch-bearer in a forgotten ritual , little brown druid illuminating some ancient night ?
and who could fail to notice , lit up in the blazing insulation , the tiny looks of wonderment on the faces of his fellow mice — one-time inhabitants of what once was your house in the country ?
and that to me was a bad start to the afterlife , having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified .
( applause ) bc : i 'm not sure if other poems will be animated .
and schlepping is an ancient and honorable art .
and it 's addressed to a certain person .
of course , there will be time for all that later in your life , after you come out of your room and begin to blossom , or at least pick up all your socks .
but then she was beheaded , so never mind her as a role model .
but of course , that was in austria at the height of romantic lyricism , not here in the suburbs of cleveland . ( laughter )
frankly , who cares if annie oakley was a crack shot at 15 or if maria callas debuted as tosca at 17 ?
we think you 're special just being you — playing with your food and staring into space .
thanks . ( applause )
it 's my job to make sure the collection stays okay , and that it grows , and basically it means i collect dead animals .
( laughter ) and in those days , i developed an ear to identify birds just by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass .
and it was on june 5 , 1995 , that i heard a loud bang against the glass that changed my life and ended that of a duck .
it 's laying dead on its belly .
`` i said , `` '' something 's wrong here . '' '' one is dead , one is alive . that must be necrophilia . ''
( laughter ) i mean , it 's a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine , but to share this among your peers is something different .
as you probably know , in science , when you write a kind of special paper , only six or seven people read it .
( laughter ) but then something good happened .
real nobel laureates hand you the prize .
that 's the first thing .
`` here 's one of my fellow winners . that 's charles paxton who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper , `` '' courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans under farming conditions in britain . '' '' ( laughter ) and i think there are one or two more ig nobel prize winners in this room . ''
dan , where are you ? dan ariely ?
applause for dan .
( applause ) dan won his prize in medicine for demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine works better than low-priced fake medicine .
i 'm going to pass it around .
you can pass it around .
these are pigeons in rotterdam .
at least , i thought it was till i got these slides .
and here you see a dead duck .
it 's been there for three days , and it 's laying on its back .
so there goes my theory of necrophilia .
another example of the impact of glass buildings on the life of birds .
here he goes , and here 's a short video .
and as you know , or as you may not know , this is one of the major causes of death for birds in the world .
so i hope to see you next year in rotterdam , the netherlands , for dead duck day .
despite all this focus on the healthy self , general public knowledge of the anatomical self is lacking .
how many of you here made it through anatomy ?
but what happens when we 're done studying ?
and this drive to not only teach but also to entertain resulted in some of the strangest anatomical illustrations .
on the mirrored figure , he renders the full anatomy and covers it in glitter , making it look like candy .
now , this next artist i 've been following for many years , watching him excite the public about anatomy .
thank you .
so there seems to be a complete disconnect here .
in truth , we do live in a world that science can understand .
and i 'd be wrong to dis that completely .
moving over , we come , of course , to consultancy .
it 's a very simple yet devastating problem , one that spans the globe and is affecting all of us .
but why is blood red ?
and from that slightly crazy question , over two decades and many campaigns later , including alerting the world to the problem of blood diamonds funding war , from that crazy question , global witness is now an 80-strong team of campaigners , investigators , journalists and lawyers .
or political corruption in sarawak , malaysia , which has led to the destruction of much of its forests .
well , that uses anonymous companies too .
and the awful thing is , there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life .
the $ 100 million american medicare fraud , the supply of weapons to wars around the world including those in eastern europe in the early '90s .
well , the answer is , yes you can .
and then finally , give your company a name add a few more details and make your payment .
and not only is it easy , really , really easy and cheap , it 's totally legal too .
companies were created to give people a chance to innovate and not have to put everything on the line .
and so i come to my wish .
my wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good .
together let 's ignite world opinion , change the law , and launch a new era of openness in business .
well , imagine if you could go online and look up the real owner of a company .
so how are we going to do this ?
well , there is only one way .
together , we have to change the law globally to create public registries which list the true owners of companies and can be accessed by all with no loopholes .
and the techies among you , you could really help us create a prototype public registry to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be .
together , let 's kickstart this global movement .
let 's just do it , let 's end anonymous companies .
we went about getting evidence of what was going on .
and they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle .
and that is that all of us want to be happy .
now my topic is gratefulness .
many people would say , well , that 's very easy .
but think again .
they radiate happiness . you are surprised .
i appeal to your own experience .
and it 's really given .
these two things have to come together .
it has to be something valuable , and it 's a real gift .
and when these two things come together , something that 's really valuable to me and i realize it 's freely given , then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart , happiness spontaneously rises in my heart .
does that mean that we can be grateful for everything ?
certainly not .
it is n't as bad as it might seem .
it may be to stand up for your opinion , to stand up for your conviction .
that 's the wonderful richness of life .
so how can we find a method that will harness this ?
every time i turned on the faucet , i was overwhelmed .
we have a network for grateful living , and it has mushroomed .
and that 's one way that we try to time technology trends .
`` i 'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that i call my `` '' grand unified theory of predicting the future , '' '' but it 's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future . ''
it 's based on the presumption , the observation even , that all important technologies go through four stages in their life — at least one of the four stages , sometimes all four of the stages .
after it falls below a critical price , it will tend , if it 's successful , to rise above a critical mass , a penetration .
and even if you missed , you know , the first boom of wi-fi — you know , wi-fi did the critical price , it did the critical mass , but has n't done displacement yet , and has n't done free yet — there 's still more opportunity in that .
the dvd , as you know , was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive . but you can see that by 1998 , it had fallen below 400 dollars , and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold .
and maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them , and bring the rest of your entertainment in .
reed hastings is here . he clearly saw that that was a moment , that was an inflection point that he could do something with .
and here too , you can see the implications in the world at large .
i 'd like to talk about some other technologies out there , just technologies on our radar — and i 'll use this lens , these four , as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development .
it is now possible — will be possible , and if craig venter indeed comes today , he may tell you something about this — to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year .
the generics came in , first in brazil and elsewhere , and the effect was just dramatic on pricing .
now we 've switched to critical mass .
these are now technologies that are hitting critical mass .
i do n't know whether anybody has a prius 2004 , but they 're fantastic .
at two percent , you start seeing them on the roads everywhere .
and what 's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you 've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry .
it 's a deflationary force , if not handled right .
and here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive .
and their response is draconian , and not necessarily the one that 's going to get them out of this .
it was surprisingly non-innovative , moved very slowly , but then there was just so much fiber out there , you could n't hold back , and look how quickly the price fell .
it is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we 're seeing in our world today .
( laughter ) imagine seeing your life , 30 years of it , go by , and it was , to say the least , for me , quite a shocking experience .
it 's not that i was fidel castro and i could talk for two hours , or bucky fuller .
and this was a device we built in the '70s , which has never even been picked up .
entebbe happened .
and that created the media lab .
that is the original slide from that year , and it has worked in lockstep obedience .
look at the kid on the left , and so on .
nn : you 're going to give me extra time ?
a lot less .
well , that 's the way it was done for hundreds of years .
how did it come about ?
multics was a trailblazing interactive time-sharing system .
( laughter ) now , at harvard , we learned by the case method .
so i decided to build a prototype .
print was n't working yet , so i had to copy everything down .
i did five-year projections . i did all sorts of different scenarios .
welcome to the new world .
but then by the end of the decade , the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement .
in 1979 , i witnessed my first military coup .
now europe came as a shock to me , and i think i started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in .
i think it was a tactic of survival .
so here i was in 2008 wondering where i was in my life .
i wanted to document on film the 2008 presidential elections .
was what was happening in ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me ?
now the first round of the voting did n't bring forth a clear winner — so nobody had achieved the absolute majority — so voting went into a second round three weeks later .
the heat was on .
and then the cliche came to haunt us .
and not only that , i am documenting it — documenting my own cultural shortcomings .
so when the echo of the gunshots had lingered , it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob , and i did n't believe what i was hearing .
after all , they decide , and they did .
it could be , by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace .
but instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide , ghana honored democracy and its people .
so the people went back to the polls to determine their own president , not the legal system .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i 'm still searching for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently .
thank you .
but then i realized that , as much as i know that these moments have contributed on my journey , they have influenced my journey but they have not been the beginning of it , but the true beginning of my journey was in front of a mud house in upper sindh of pakistan , where my father held the hand of my 14-year-old mother and they decided to walk out of the village to go to a town where they could send their kids to school .
while we were living in a community i fondly remember as called ribabad , which means community of the poor , my dad made sure that we also had a house in our rural homeland .
i was aware that i was the only girl who got to have such freedom , and i was guilty of it .
while going to school in karachi and hyderabad , a lot of my cousins and childhood friends were getting married off , some to older men , some in exchange , some even as second wives .
i got to see the beautiful tradition and its magic fade in front of me when i saw that the birth of a girl child was celebrated with sadness , when women were told to have patience as their main virtue .
usually the killer is the brother or father or the uncle in the family .
a custom that kills did not make any sense to me , and i knew i had to do something about it this time .
it was so big it looked as if it was going to take up half of the only room we had , and had so many pieces and wires that needed to be connected .
i was devastated .
as a teenager , i was blaming myself for everything that happened .
we were saying no to something that was very important to them , challenging their code of honor , and hurting them deeply in the process .
the women in the villages had no idea we were fighting for them in the streets .
the policies of a country do not necessarily always affect the tribal and rural communities .
yes , apologize .
we soon called this project sughar .
galileo , by the way , did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute .
i 'd like to start my performance by saying 90 percent of everything is crap .
ninety percent of everything is crap , so there 's this to prove that sturgeon was correct .
keep the giraffe for a moment , okay ?
well , the truth is , why is the majority of everything bad ?
the idea was to take a piece of paper and fold it inside out using only your weaker hand , in my case , the left hand .
something that would look like this .
a paper clip makes this a little bit more interesting .
not only that , if instead of using my hand with the fingers , i use my hand closed into a fist , that makes this even a little bit more interesting .
the 10 of hearts ?
there 's this to prove that things can always change — the 10 of hearts .
`` but i was not really paying attention to the book because i was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before , `` i will not touch the deck till the end . '' ''
perfect . sir , you 're going to play my role in this story .
hg : indeed !
it was a black card .
since it 's a high spade , it could be a nine , a 10 , a jack , king , queen or the ace of spades .
hg : the king of spades , indeed .
and the first number i thought of was ...
audience member 2 : 17 .
hg : indeed ! it was the 17 .
but he left his notebook that was there from the beginning .
and when i picked it up , that was the best secret i 've ever experienced .
and this was his way of sharing a secret with me .
and the reason why we do n't see them as often , it 's because we do n't place ourselves in a position to search for those amazing things .
first of all , take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill .
so i want to make sure it 's exactly the same bill .
and do you mind , can you take some cards and shuffle ?
you can take some cards and shuffle .
do you mind doing that for me , sir ?
please cut and complete .
madam , can you take the dollar bill ?
all the cards in order , just for you .
and he explained to me that , when i shave , i have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is , but on the right side of my face i was badly burned so i have no hair , and this creates lack of symmetry .
it sounded interesting . he asked me to go and shave .
when i got back to his office , i was n't really sure .
`` ( laughter ) and he said , `` '' dan , what 's wrong with you ? ''
`` do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently ? '' '' none of those happened . ''
( laughter ) now you probably think that this guy 's a schmuck .
but let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
so we had one group that i hoped their performance would be very high , another group that i thought their performance would be very low , and when i got the results , that 's what we got — i was very happy — aside from one person .
so i looked carefully at this guy .
and i remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
`` who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? '' '' but a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , `` '' what would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ? ''
what would have happened if he was in the other group ?
but you know , these stories , and lots of other experiments that we 've done on conflicts of interest , basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me .
the first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces .
they just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased .
the most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives .
i was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .
but this was not the case .
( applause )
right now , america is in an unremitting state of trauma .
i think that arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes .
one day , i was glancing through my bank statement ( i did n't have much to look at ) and i 've noticed that in the upper corner there was a symbol , that i 'm going to show you , saying that document had been made in plain language , for me to understand it .
when i came back to portugal , for good , i came across with several documents - for example , my work contract , the papers i had to sign to buy a house , the electricity bill — a series of documents that reminded me of that bank statement .
because i had to read everything twice or thrice , to begin to understand what was written there .
and then , that little seed that had been sown in 1996 , started germinating .
and one day , i found myself entering through my boss ' office and quitting my job to dedicate myself to this .
i found out that it was a much more severe problem than i thought .
it was n't only about these documents being complex and annoying , it was the fact that portuguese people 's literacy — literacy is the hability to understand written documents — is extremely low . i 'm going to show you a chart about portuguese people 's literacy [ rate ] .
50 % of the portuguese . then we have 30 % more , those yellow ones , over there , people who get by on the daily basis .
that is , if they do n't have to read anything too new or too different , they will manage .
`` from time to time , i 'm arriving home and he says : `` miss sandra ! `` ; `` yes , mr . domingos . '' ''
`` `` '' here is a little letter . '' '' so , the deal is : when mr. domingos or someone in the family or in the neighbourhood receives something that they do n't understand , they come to me and i help them to translate it . ''
in that same year , i 've found out , only 20 % of people had used these surgery-bank checks .
hum ? are you clear ?
and this one is really good . this one , i signed a renting contract to the new office on friday and i laughed my head off .
we get as lost as mr. domingos .
and these documents are not written by experts to experts , as the ones from the string theory .
no ! these are documents written for me , these are the public documents , the public documents i need to understand in my daily life , to govern myself , to live my life .
this has to be clear , so that i can understand .
do you think that if there was a culture of clarity in the financial sector things would have got up to where they 've got ?
i 'm going to show you an example .
there is n't much doubt , is there ?
so , how is this achieved ? how can you make the state and companies communicate with citizens in a language they can understand at first glance ?
`` and you think , `` '' well , that 's normal . they are countries that are a bit ahead . ''
`` `` '' but they are countries that are a bit ahead . ''
`` `` it would be nice if in our country there was also legislation towards that , would n't it be ? '' ''
but the thing is : it is not applied . so , the question , the path of going through legislation , enforcing through legislation , works in those countries where laws are made to be applied .
it 's the path of civil movements , that are based in a mentality shift .
`` in countries where this really went forward — do you remember the english label , of the `` '' plain english campaign '' '' ? — this is all based on a consumers ' movement . ''
on this side we have : understanding is a right .
no ! demand to understand . ask .
it 's not easy , and perhaps it 's even a bit embarrassing , is n't it ?
`` no , you do n't , right ? you say : `` look , when you do n't understand , you put your hand up in the air and ask the teacher until you are cleared . '' ''
a while ago , they told us about einstein .
grandma has a lot to do . she is not going to read three pages to get to the main idea .
`` we are going to start with the `` '' claro '' '' guide of justice . ''
another thing we will do is to grant prizes to the worse and best documents , because , indeed , there are people who are working to communicate in a clearer way , and that have to be rewarded , and there are lazy people that do nothing about it and need to be humiliated .
and if you do n't have a grandmother , write to mr. domingos , he will like it .
but yet , it was simple .
and if we did that , then google would back this .
the world changes .
we work out slowly and gradually how to live in better ways .
you can see the great chinese famine .
but this is the map of the world changed again to make area large , the further away people are from each area .
our world is changing .
this is a map showing where the water falls on our planet .
you can see that india is in the center of this world .
let 's start by thinking about the member countries of the oecd , or the organization of economic cooperation and development .
holding down the right flank of the oecd , all the way on the other side , is greece .
and what you can see is that over the last 25 years , greece has barely managed to save more than 10 percent of their gdp .
now that we see these huge differences in savings rates , how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences ?
let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ .
now , how might that be ? let me give you an example .
`` why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modify what i 'm saying to say , `` '' it will rain , '' '' or `` '' it 's going to rain . '' '' it 's simply not permissible in english to say , `` '' it rain tomorrow . '' '' in contrast to that , that 's almost exactly what you would say in chinese . ''
a chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an english speaker 's ears .
if , on the other hand , you speak a futureless language , the present and the future , you speak about them identically .
well , what i did with that was to access the linguistics literature .
what is the average difference here ?
now while these findings are suggestive , countries can be different in so many different ways that it 's very , very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences .
`` `` '' excuse me , would you mind if i peruse your stock portfolio ? ''
do you happen to know how much your house is worth ? do you mind telling me ?
( laughter ) combine that with a demographic and health survey collected by usaid in developing countries in africa , for example , which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the hiv status of families living in , for example , rural nigeria .
and what i 'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure , and then i 'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels .
what are the characteristics we can control for ?
well i 'm going to match families on country of birth and residence , the demographics — what sex , their age — their income level within their own country , their educational achievement , a lot about their family structure .
it turns out there are six different ways to be married in europe .
and most granularly , i break them down by religion where there are 72 categories of religions in the world — so an extreme level of granularity .
there are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself .
well , think about smoking , for example .
if savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure , smoking is just the opposite .
it 's current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
and that 's exactly what we find .
thank you very much .
my friend andy cavatorta was building a robotic harp for bjork 's biophilia tour and i wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and play music .
i built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the museum of science and industry in chicago , and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen .
and when you think about it , this makes a lot of sense , that using specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily .
so if we want to tweak the color , we just enter the color mode , and then we get three different dials for tweaking the color , or if we want to adjust the audio , then we get two different dials for that , these physical objects .
so the idea is that we get the speed and efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and versatility of a system that 's designed in software .
but when we want to have a video chat or play a game or lay out the slides to our next ted talk , the objects on the table come alive .
they literally flipped the switch .
no kidding .
( applause ) to do that , do n't look at the agribusiness model for the future .
if we could get that , maybe we could have a better understanding of how the brain is organized to yield thoughts and emotions and actions and sensations .
maybe we could try to pinpoint the exact changes in the brain that result in diseases , diseases like alzheimer 's and epilepsy and parkinson 's , for which there are few treatments , much less cures , and for which , very often , we do n't know the cause or the origins and what 's really causing them to occur .
the density of the brain is incredible .
so it 's not at the level of resolution where it can pinpoint the molecular changes that occur or the changes in the wiring of these networks that contributes to our ability to be conscious and powerful beings .
microscopes , of course , will use light to look at little tiny things .
for centuries , they 've been used to look at things like bacteria .
but light is fundamentally limited .
this could potentially be quite dramatic .
polymers are chains of atoms arranged in long , thin lines .
they 're separated by distances that are around the size of a biomolecule .
we need to pull the molecules of the brain apart from each other , and to do that , we need to have a little handle that allows those polymers to bind to them and to exert their force .
so we need to find a way to make the polymers inside .
and of course , we can pinpoint , hopefully , the actual problems in the brain at a molecular level .
what if we could actually look into cells in the brain and figure out , wow , here are the 17 molecules that have altered in this brain tissue that has been undergoing epilepsy or changing in parkinson 's disease or otherwise being altered ?
we can build drugs that bind those .
it turns out that if you look at cancers , if you look at the immune system , if you look at aging , if you look at development — all these processes are involving large-scale biological systems .
so what we 're trying to do now is to figure out if we can actually use this technology to map the building blocks of life in a wide variety of diseases .
sometimes , it 's even guesswork .
my hope is we can actually turn what might be a high-risk moon shot into something that 's more reliable .
we understood gravity ; we understood aerodynamics .
we can map the patterns that occur in living systems , and figure out how to overcome the diseases that plague us .
thank you very much .
ld : at the opposite end of the spectrum is argentina .
if only my parents knew .
you can tweet a message and start a protest in egypt .
hold it up .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
that 's a lot . almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
but today i will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
and if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
they said , we do n't want this data retention .
`` they were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said : `` '' we do n't want this . '' '' and here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of berlin and said , `` freedom , not fear . '' ''
and i asked them once , and i asked them again , and i got no real answer . it was only blah blah answers .
so at the end , i had a settlement with them .
i 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for .
because in the mean time , the german constitutional court ruled that the implementation of this e.u . directive into german law was unconstitutional .
but then after a while i realized , this is my life .
you can zoom in and zoom out , you can wind back and fast forward .
you can see every step i take .
all this is possible with this information .
but you can see how your people are communicating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing . if you have access to this information ,
this is a blueprint how to survey your society , because you know who talks to whom , who sends whom an email , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
and this information is stored for at least six months in europe , up to two years .
because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline .
but self-determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction .
so , in the future , every time you use your mobile phone , let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age .
so i picked think.com , but then i thought , you know , there 's a lot of really interesting names out there .
if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
you 'd kind of depend on people to do that , and that was the building block .
in fact , it was so successful that there 's no way that these days you could make a book like this .
my rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick .
imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
nobody has claimed credit for that .
now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant .
and so there 's a lot of — i 'm sure you 've read a lot in papers , about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those .
so actually , in the early days , back when it was the arpanet , there were actually times — there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it .
so , in other words , it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it .
so of course , the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy , who would send it back in time and get it there super early , so every message in the internet started getting switched through this one node , and of course that clogged everything up .
everything started breaking .
i mean , everything off , it 's like the service call you get from the cable company , except for the whole world .
that 's crazy . it was never designed to do things like that .
and in fact , nobody really exactly understands all the things it 's being used for right now .
and so if you hear an expert talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather , or something like that .
they have an informed opinion , but it 's changing so quickly that even the experts do n't know exactly what 's going on .
so if you see one of these maps of the internet , it 's just somebody 's guess .
but so what we need is a plan b .
`` so i think that , if people understand how much we 're starting to depend on the internet , and how vulnerable it is , we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist , and i think if enough people say , `` '' yeah , i would like to use it , i 'd like to have such a system , '' '' then it will get built . ''
america 's public energy conversation boils down to this question : would you rather die of a ) oil wars , or b ) climate change , or c ) nuclear holocaust , or d ) all of the above ?
what if we could make energy do our work without working our undoing ?
could we reinvent fire ?
you see , fire made us human ; fossil fuels made us modern .
let 's see how .
so we need a new fire .
and switching from the old fire to the new fire means changing two big stories about oil and electricity , each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air .
by 2050 though , it could become efficient , connected and distributed with elegantly frugal autos , factories and buildings all relying on a modern , secure and resilient electricity system .
this could cost , by 2050 , five trillion dollars less in net present value , that is expressed as a lump sum today , than business as usual — assuming that carbon emissions and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero — a conservatively low estimate .
yet this cheaper energy system could support 158 percent bigger u.s. economy all without needing oil or coal , or for that matter nuclear energy .
moreover , this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of congress and no new federal taxes , mandate subsidies or laws and running washington gridlock .
and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security , or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health , reinventing fire makes sense and makes money .
general eisenhower reputedly said that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies .
those combinations yield very much more than the sum of the parts , especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities .
oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day , plus another four billion dollars a day in hidden economic and military costs , raising its total cost to over a sixth of gdp .
so sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today , while the driving cost , even from the start , is very much lower .
the sales can grow and the prices fall even faster with temporary feebates , that is rebates for efficient new autos paid for by fees on inefficient ones .
the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers .
of course , computers and electronics are now america 's biggest industry , while typewriter makers have vanished .
currently the leader is germany .
( laughter ) in one minute — and you can tell from the sound how immensely stiff and strong it is .
but such manufacturing techniques can scale to automotive speed and cost with aerospace performance .
they can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos .
if we made all of our autos this way , it would save oil equivalent to finding one and a half saudi arabias , or half an opec , by drilling in the detroit formation , a very prospective play .
and combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes , now on the drawing board , can save close to a trillion dollars .
we can use some smart it to enhance transit and enable car sharing and ride sharing .
in fact , three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil , not in supply , but in demand .
but the electrified vehicles do n't need to burden the electricity grid .
changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it .
but as efficiency in buildings and industry starts to grow faster than the economy , america 's electricity use could actually shrink , even with the little extra use required for those efficient electrified autos .
that is how our 2010 retrofit is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the empire state building — remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site into super windows that pass light , but reflect heat .
and then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones saved 17 million dollars of capital cost , which helped pay for the other improvements and reduce the payback to just three years .
this is not about new technology , it 's just rearranging our metal furniture .
and of course , as you go back upstream , the components get smaller and therefore cheaper .
now needing less electricity would ease and speed the shift to new sources of electricity , chiefly renewables .
for each of the past four years half of the world 's new generating capacity has been renewable , mainly lately in developing countries .
in fact in this country , no new nuclear power plant has been able to raise any private construction capital , despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies .
so how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants ?
but we only need to replace them once .
we 're often told though that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on , because they 're 24/7 , whereas wind and solar power are variable , and hence supposedly unreliable .
actually no generator is 24/7 . they all break .
that is how , for example , four german states in 2010 were 43 to 52 percent wind powered .
portugal was 45 percent renewable powered , denmark 36 .
and it 's how all of europe can shift to renewable electricity .
that approach is exactly what the pentagon is adopting for its own power supply .
they think they need that ; how about the rest of us that they 're defending ?
and those utilities were rewarded , as they still are in 34 states , for selling you more electricity .
so our energy future is not fate , but choice , and that choice is very flexible .
well that 's what 's actually happened so far .
it 's fallen by half .
but with today 's much better technologies , more mature delivery channels and integrative design , we can do far more and even cheaper .
now our team at rmi helps smart companies to get unstuck and speed this journey via six sectoral initiatives , with some more hatching .
of course there 's still a lot of old thinking out there too .
we humans are inventing a new fire , not dug from below , but flowing from above ; not scarce , but bountiful ; not local , but everywhere ; not transient , but permanent ; not costly , but free .
and this is why the greatest designers are almost always the biggest dreamers and rebels and renegades .
this has been the case throughout history , all the way back to the year 300 bc , when a 13-year-old became the king of a remote , very poor and very small asian country .
and he did the same for daggers , axes , spears , shields and every other form of weaponry .
his formidably equipped army won batter after battle , and within 15 years , his tiny kingdom had succeeded in conquering all its larger , richer , more powerful neighbors , to found the mighty chinese empire .
now , no one , of course , would have thought of describing ying zheng as a designer at the time — why would they ?
and so did another equally improbable , accidental designer , who was also not above using violence to get what he wanted .
this was edward teach , better known as the british pirate , blackbeard .
so in other words , they could take the ships without wasting ammunition , or incurring casualties .
so edward teach redesigned himself as blackbeard by playing the part of a merciless brute .
he wore heavy jackets and big hats to accentuate his height .
he even attached matches to the brim of his hat and set them alight , so they sizzled menacingly whenever his ship was poised to attack .
and like many pirates of that era , he flew a flag that bore the macabre symbols of a human skull and a pair of crossed bones , because those motifs had signified death in so many cultures for centuries , that their meaning was instantly recognizable , even in the lawless , illiterate world of the high seas : surrender or you 'll suffer .
her mission was to provide decent healthcare for everyone .
back in britain , she mounted another campaign , this time for civilian hospitals , and insisted that the same design principles were applied to them .
but by then , design was seen as a tool of the industrial age .
he radicalized the bauhaus design school in 1920s germany , and yet some of his former colleagues shunned him when he struggled to open a new bauhaus in chicago years later .
now , it was the courage and verve of radical designers like bucky and moholy that drew me to design .
i wrote about politics , economics and corporate affairs , and i could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields .
( applause ) and greatly as i admire the achievements of professional designers , which have been extraordinary and immense , i also believe that design benefits hugely from the originality , the lateral thinking and the resourcefulness of its rebels and renegades .
because even very basic advances in digital technology have enabled them to operate increasingly independently , in or out of a commercial context , to pursue ever more ambitious and eclectic objectives .
now , some of my favorite examples of this are in africa , where a new generation of designers are developing incredible internet of things technologies to fulfill florence nightingale 's dream of improving healthcare in countries where more people now have access to cell phones than to clean , running water .
he 's a young , cameroonian design engineer who has a adapted a tablet computer into the cardiopad , a mobile heart-monitoring device .
arthur zang started working on the cardiopad eight years ago , in his final year at university .
and we all stand to benefit .
this was taken using satellite , so it 's got tremendous spatial resolution .
sea level was 120 meters lower .
we do n't know .
it 's made of calcium carbonate , so you can see its tentacles there , moving in the ocean currents .
and here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system , and we put it into a sampling container .
we then found corals that are of an intermediate age , and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition .
it 's just a beautiful place .
one good thing did come out of it .
we have never understood it .
and watch the change as it goes into this long dry season .
because it 's very hollow , all the noise will disappear , so it 's a very silent road .
it also has disadvantages , of course , and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur .
and finally , this raveling can also lead to more and more damage .
sometimes you can create potholes with that .
potholes , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
then you need a machine , like you see here , that you can use for cooking — an induction machine .
today i use a microwave because i can not take the big induction machine here onstage .
so a microwave is a similar system .
so i said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .
several times we can repeat that .
so actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine — this is the big version we have made to go on the real road — if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .
so we still have the specimen here . it 's quite warm .
thank you .
( applause )
by the way , this does n't help .
consumers are different than citizens .
so thank you very much .
( applause )
it 's a horrifying fact .
and so , back to plastic .
and my job is to try to collect the best of each kid 's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work .
well , reality is a bit more complicated than this .
and its a place where adults and kids can play together .
thank you .
now let 's see what has happened in the world .
and you need the fourth factor , which perhaps is the most important factor .
now , i 'm not thinking about a distant future .
our universe is analog .
so why are screens so pervasive in our analog life ?
why ?
it required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine .
but how would that machine then interact with reality ?
i take inspiration from our ancestors .
thank you .
jn : thanks for the question .
hw : amazing . ok , jeff , please go away . thank you very much .
i was also making a tv series for the bbc at the time .
its origins are located in russia .
it was led by felix dzerzhinsky .
at the top of this tremendous apparatus , there was one man , erich mielke .
bg : a personal question , and this is the last one .
( applause ) bg : hubertus , thank you very much .
and i started playing with it more like a puzzle .
the thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good as any car that you would have today .
and two , it has be more affordable than today 's cars .
alright ? that 's not something that we can finance or buy today .
so we 're bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
`` in a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic `` batteries not included . '' ''
and so the first thought that came to mind is , everywhere we park we have electric power .
but e-miles follow moore 's law .
and pick the two best places — the one where you did n't need any range extension .
the foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground .
by 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars even at the pace we 're going at right now .
and the downs are going to be much longer and the ups are going to be much shorter .
europe has solved it . they just put a tax on gasoline .
but our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars .
in denmark , we will drive all the cars in denmark from windmills , not from oil .
we have to come and attack this problem with a focus , with an effort that actually says , we 're going to go to zero before the world ends .
came from a source of energy that was immoral : human slaves .
we have to make it immediately .
t : i do n't ever want to let my country down !
t : most importantly ... s : most importantly ...
cr : i do n't know if we can do this , but we 've got the image of the cat .
so i thought about a notice board .
it sounds totally crazy .
what i 'm worried is that we throw out the baby with the bathwater .
cr : so you 're talking about saving lives .
cr : but it 's not only you 're talking about automated cars .
the principle of that for you is what ?
it took a long time .
and i said , what did they fundamentally do wrong ?
architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these .
they use these to design with and they design for them , which is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look like this — ( loud crowd noise ) — and sound like this , shouting from a foot away to try and be heard by our dinner companion , or why we get on airplanes — ( flight attendant announcements ) — which cost 200 million pounds , with somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset on a cheap stereo system , making us jump out of our skins .
it 's our health , our social behavior , and our productivity as well .
how does this work ? well , two ways .
first of all , ambience . i have a whole tedtalk about this .
sound affects us physiologically , psychologically , cognitively and behaviorally all the time .
the sound around us is affecting us even though we 're not conscious of it .
if the space i 'm sending it in is not effective , that communication ca n't happen .
spaces tend to include noise and acoustics .
many rooms are not so good .
i think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero , would n't we ? and yet , as noise levels go up , so do the errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals .
`` ( `` '' do architects have ears ? '' '' ) ( laughter ) now , that 's a little unfair . some of my best friends are architects . ( laughter ) and they definitely do have ears . ''
but i think sometimes they do n't use them when they 're designing buildings . here 's a case in point .
unfortunately , it was designed like a corporate headquarters , with a vast central atrium and classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all .
old-fashioned classrooms suffer too .
now that does n't mean they only get half their education , but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what 's going on .
this is affected massively by reverberation time , how reverberant a room is .
now that education you would receive , and thanks to the british acoustician adrian james for those simulations . the signal was the same , the background noise was the same .
now that 's not just deaf children . that could be any child who 's got a cold , glue ear , an ear infection , even hay fever . on a given day , one in eight children fall into that group , on any given day .
then you have children for whom english is a second language , or whatever they 're being taught in is a second language .
in the u.k. , that 's more than 10 percent of the school population .
( noisy conversation ) this study in germany found the average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels .
two and a half thousand pounds .
i 'm glad that debate is happening on this .
where are the urban sound planners ?
i do n't know of one in the world , and the opportunity is there to transform our experience in our cities .
people who say , do n't sit that team next to this team , because they like noise and they need quiet .
it 's time to start designing for the ears .
so that 's a still from the video there .
and then i get asked questions .
and the questions usually have a very particular format .
and what i do is i look for similarities and differences in the solutions that they 've evolved for fundamental biological problems .
so today i 'm here to argue that this is not at all an esoteric ivory tower activity that we find at our universities , but that broad study across species , tissue types and organ systems can produce insights that have direct implications for human health .
( laughter ) and i think we see this tremendous variation because it 's a really effective solution to a very basic biological problem , and that is getting sperm in a position to meet up with eggs and form zygotes .
now the penis is n't actually required for internal fertiliztion , but when internal fertilization evolves , penises often follow .
but then one day i started thinking about the mammalian penis .
and moreover , it has to work .
the skeletal support comes from an interaction between a pressurized fluid and a surrounding wall of tissue that 's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins .
it has a central space of spongy erectile tissue that fills with fluid — in this case blood — surrounded by a wall of tissue that 's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen .
and that explained to me expansion — made sense : more fluid , you get tissues that expand — but it did n't actually explain erection .
because there was no mechanism in this explanation for making this structure hard to bend .
`` and this was the point at which my graduate adviser said , `` whoa ! hold on . slow down . '' ''
and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we had found in nature up to that point had the same basic elements .
so the image behind me shows a piece of tissue in one of these cross helical skeletons cut so that you 're looking at the surface of the wall .
it lengthens , shortens and bends really easily in response to internal or external forces .
now my adviser 's concern was what if the penile wall tissue is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton .
i was really surprised at this .
that 's because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton , and that was with fibers at zero degrees and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure .
so it 'll be made of the same cotton cloth , same balloon , same internal pressure .
but the only difference is that the fibers are arranged differently .
now what that tells us is that wall tissues are doing so much more than just covering the vascular tissues .
they 're an integral part of the penile skeleton .
i really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies .
after all , if ideas about invertebrate skeletons can give us insights about mammalian reproductive systems , there could be lots of other wild and productive connections lurking out there just waiting to be found .
the curator had only one condition : i had to use the arabic script for my artwork .
but that led to a series of no , coming out of the book like ammunition , and adding messages to them , and i started spraying them on the walls .
a group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall . it 's one to one .
another artist comes , paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank .
`` the message reads , [ arabic ] `` you can crush the flowers , but you ca n't delay spring . '' ''
that patient was my government .
( applause ) and kenya was no exception .
when i returned to kenya in 2014 , there was 17 percent youth unemployment .
new business is good for everyone .
we had our work cut out for us .
we 're a group of computer scientists , mathematicians , engineers and a cancer researcher , who understood that in order to cure the sickness of a system as big as government , we needed to examine the whole body , and then we needed to drill down all the way from the organs , into the tissues , all the way to single cells , so that we could properly make a diagnosis .
god forbid you had to go to court to get help in being able to settle a dispute to enforce a contract , because that process alone would take you 465 days .
when we started out , i thought i was going to find so much corruption , i was literally going to either die or get killed in the process .
( laughter ) but when we dug deeper , we did n't find corruption in the classic sense : slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness , waiting to grease the palms of their friends .
and when people feel stuck and helpless , they stop seeing their role in a bigger system .
( applause ) and in recognition of the significant reforms we 've been able to implement in such a short time , kenya was recognized to be among the top three global reformers in the world two years in a row . ( applause )
you do n't intend to be an entrepreneur .
it 's easy in this political and global economy to want to give up when we think about transforming government .
we can easily resign to the fact or to the thinking that government is too inefficient , too corrupt , unfixable .
( applause )
here 's one .
so i think it 's time we try and tell a really good poop joke .
thank you .
so we 're having record-breaking temperatures .
it goes back more than a century .
these downpours are really unusual .
it 's an enormous burden .
so the rest , 22 trillion dollars — unburnable .
this year , we 're on track to beat it 68 times over .
`` `` '' how many can we sell by the year 2000 ? '' '' they asked . ''
first , the cost came down much faster than anybody expected , even as the quality went up .
so what about the electricity grids in the developing world ?
and in many areas , they do n't exist .
all of these coal plants have had their retirement announced .
we are solving this crisis .
many thousands , tens of thousands , marched in cities around the world .
but eight years and two months later , in the moment that neil armstrong set foot on the moon , there was great cheer that went up in nasa 's mission control in houston .
thank you very much .
( laughter ) and so she went and formed an alliance with the sierra club and they formed a new organization called the green tea party . ( laughter )
and it did n't work out economically for some of them , but it kick-started this global revolution .
ca : al gore , that was incredibly powerful .
`` ah yes , those university days , a heady mix of ph.d-level pure mathematics and world debating championships , or , as i like to say , `` '' hello , ladies . oh yeah . '' '' did n't get much sexier than the spence at university , let me tell you . ''
from the youngest of ages , we display a prodigious sporting talent .
i 'm almost five years old . fair to say , i 'm enjoying the day a lot more than santa was .
`` i 've got no plans . '' '' it was an exercise in democratic schooling , and i am all for democratic schooling , but we were only seven . ''
`` that 'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole . '' '' now i was n't trying to be smart . ''
`` i just politely raised my hand , and when ms. russell acknowledged me , i said , in front of my year two classmates , and i quote , `` '' but miss , surely if the diagonal of the square is less than the diameter of the circle , well , the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole . '' '' ( laughter ) `` it 'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop , would n't it ? '' ''
today we 're going to talk about prime numbers .
the proof of that is a great party trick that admittedly only works at certain parties .
over thousands of years ago , he proved that for us .
all you need to know , of all the mathematics you 've ever learned , unlearned , crammed , forgotten , never understood in the first place , all you need to know is this : when i say 2 ^ 5 , i 'm talking about five little number twos next to each other all multiplied together , 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 .
if you 've got that , you 're with me for the entire journey . okay ?
31 is a prime number , and that five in the power is also a prime number .
and one of the things about the search for massive primes that i love so much is some of the great mathematical minds of all time have gone on this search .
he proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill , ink , paper and his mind .
we know that ( 2 ^ 127 ) - 1 is a prime number .
we knew it was like six , but we did n't know what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together to give us that massive number .
a frisson of excitement went around the room .
he admitted afterwards it was n't that hard to do .
these are the largest prime numbers we knew decade by decade , each one dwarfing the one before as computers took over and our power to calculate just grew and grew .
it was the year i left university .
i was torn between mathematics and media .
in a roomful of maths ph.ds , i 'm as dumb as a box of hammers .
my skill is not in the mathematics .
it is in telling the story of the mathematics .
if you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file , that 's 22 meg .
for the slightly less geeky of you , think about the harry potter novels , okay ?
i was keen to do it , could not convince bono .
( laughter ) i know what you 're thinking : adam , we 're happy that you 're happy , but why should we care ?
let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful .
`` first of all , as i explained , to ask a computer `` '' is that number prime ? '' '' to type it in its abbreviated form , and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy , is a remarkably simple question to ask . ''
large prime numbers are a great way of testing the speed and accuracy of computer chips .
we live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but on laptops , desktops , in the palms of people 's hands who are simply helping out for the search .
we 've heard a lot about what they can and ca n't do .
this is the cubestormer ii .
how lucky are we to live in this age when mind and machine can work together ?
it was n't my highlight of 2012 .
that is what we are all about .
even if i did little , sales would be ok .
yes , it may be hard to find talent .
mostly they 're worried about each other .
either way they were going to eat it .
and i told them i 'd build them an arm .
`` `` '' who is entitled to what ? ''
so why do we learn mathematics ?
then they often hear that they 'll need it in an upcoming math class or on a future test .
now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways .
let me show you one of my favorites .
so one squared is one , two squared is four , three squared is nine , five squared is 25 , and so on .
suppose you wanted to look at adding the squares of the first few fibonacci numbers .
those are not fibonacci numbers , but if you look at them closely , you 'll see the fibonacci numbers buried inside of them .
now , as much fun as it is to discover these patterns , it 's even more satisfying to understand why they are true .
i 'll show you by drawing a simple picture .
together , they form a one-by-two rectangle .
now let me ask you a simple question : what is the area of the rectangle ?
well , on the one hand , it 's the sum of the areas of the squares inside it , right ?
it 's one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared . right ?
and if you divide the larger number by the smaller number , then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1.618 , known to many people as the golden ratio , a number which has fascinated mathematicians , scientists and artists for centuries .
we spend lots of time learning about calculation , but let 's not forget about application , including , perhaps , the most important application of all , learning how to think .
thank you very much .
and in a way , this is also another default selection .
about taking you from your own material world into a spiritual world .
the move , in fact , back to an earlier life , one i 'd begun at the british museum , back to the world of three dimensions — of sculpture and of decorative arts — to take over the department of european sculpture and decorative arts , here at the met .
but it was an incredibly busy time .
so , it was just before the time that the leonardo show was due to open when i finally made it back to the met , to new york , to see my new domain .
and i thought , on that very first day , i better tour the galleries .
and then i moved gradually around , feeling a little lost sometimes .
what was the anatomy of my distaste ?
i mean , it 's a color that i ca n't think of anything that you actually see in nature , that looks that shade .
it reminded me , in an odd kind of way , of my niece 's fifth birthday party .
there was one who would come as a fairy princess .
or , indeed , thank god there was a revolution .
( laughter ) so , there i was — in a sort of paroxysm of horror .
where i could n't stop looking .
it took me a little time .
it has an extraordinary lightness and yet , it is also amazing balanced .
and then i realized that this piece went into the kiln four times , at least four times in order to arrive at this .
well actually , the end of the trunks were originally candle holders .
on the slightly uneven pink , on the beautiful gold .
this is an object which is all about escapism .
it 's about an escapism that happens — that the aristocracy in france sought very deliberately to distinguish themselves from ordinary people .
and that seems fine .
except for the fact that it becomes a kind of sequestration of imagination .
in london , for example , with these extraordinary buildings that have been appearing over the last few years .
redolent , in a sense , of science fiction , turning london into a kind of fantasy playground .
it 's actually amazing to look out of a high building nowadays there .
there 's an idea that we do n't want these anxious-making , imaginative journeys to happen in our daily lives .
i feel lucky in a way , i 've encountered this object .
and unlike the pink elephant vase , this was a kind of love at first sight .
and he now adorns my office .
so i loved , on an art historical level , i loved that layered quality that he has .
in a way that i think would have been impossible without the pink sèvres vase in my leonardo days .
and so it was just an incredibly powerful experience .
this is a game with 50,000 individual pieces .
this is where it gets clever .
normally when we mess around with an organism 's genes , we make that thing less evolutionarily fit .
the good news is that this opens the door to some remarkable things .
and on this axis , i 'm showing dollars per person in income .
it 's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies .
it 's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with parkinson 's disease , with severe tremor , with severe pain .
and that with a little bit of help , the brain is able to help itself .
so the story started 15 years ago .
i often had to take care of patients with head trauma .
and in order to save his life , you have to decrease this intracranial pressure .
we wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue .
growing cells from a piece of tissue is a bit the same as growing very small children out from their family .
and that was , for us , a major surprise .
why ?
they divide slowly , and after a few weeks of culture , they even died .
they come from these cells .
they represent four percent of your cortical brain cells .
and we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain .
they had to retrieve food pellets from a tray .
and when they had reached a plateau of performance , we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion .
and exactly the same as humans would do , they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent , exactly the same as after a stroke .
and look now when we re-implant the cells : two months after re-implantation , the same individual .
and i really hope that i 'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself .
and of course the question is , what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials ?
and then , you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients .
and then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial .
bg : jocelyne , thank you for coming to ted and sharing this .
bg : thank you .
but above all , the scout wants to know what 's really there , as accurately as possible .
we want them to win . we want to defend them .
that 's a good call , let 's not examine it too closely .
and this is ubiquitous .
it 's just rooted in different emotions .
`` if studies come out showing that it does n't , they can say , `` huh . looks like i might be wrong . does n't mean i 'm bad or stupid . '' ''
and the key takeaway i want to leave you with about those traits is that they 're primarily not about how smart you are or about how much you know .
they 're about how you feel .
`` instead , teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea . '' '' in other words , i claim , if we really want to improve our judgment as individuals and as societies , what we need most is not more instruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics , even though those things are quite valuable . ''
do you yearn to defend your own beliefs ?
( applause )
all the footage was taken from our open rov , which is a robot that we built in our garage .
so a few years ago , my friend eric and i decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave in the foothills of the sierras .
more specifically , we created this website , openrov.com , and shared our intentions and our plans for the first few months , it was just eric and i talking back to each other on the forums , but pretty soon , we started to get feedback from makers and hobbyists , and then actually professional ocean engineers who had some suggestions for what we should do .
we kept prototyping , and eventually , we decided we wanted to go to the cave . we were ready .
but we 're already starting to get video and photos back from all over the world , including this shot from under the ice in antarctica .
what can we discover when there 's thousands of these devices roaming the seas ?
well , we did n't find any gold , but we decided that what we found was much more valuable .
it 's something that 's not limited to the james camerons of the world , but something that we 're all participating in .
it was a remarkable tale , but faiza saved the best for last .
now , i know this might sound like a dream job , or possibly a highly dubious occupation , but for me , it 's something else altogether .
i 'm half egyptian , and i 'm muslim .
like so many who straddle east and west , i 've been drawn , over the years , to try to better understand my origins .
now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society , because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage : in politics and economics , in religion and tradition , in gender and generations .
now to be sure , the arab world is vast and varied .
audience : sex .
men have sex before marriage , and people more or less turn a blind eye .
this is not a question of individual concern , this is a matter of family honor , and in particular , men 's honor .
`` but the man , he is still at the prehistoric stage . '' '' and then there are men and women who cross the heterosexual line , who have sex with their own sex , or who have a different gender identity . ''
they are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities , even their appearance .
and they face a daily struggle with social stigma , with family despair , and with religious fire and brimstone .
this is just one face of a booming sex trade across the arab region .
yeah . it 's not as if the arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups .
`` as one doctor in cairo summed it up for me , `` '' here , sex is the opposite of sport . ''
`` but sex , everybody is doing it , but nobody wants to talk about it . '' '' ( laughter ) ( music ) ( in arabic ) sef : i want to give you a piece of advice , which if you follow it , will make you happy in life . ''
hot stuff !
the encyclopedia is just one in a long line of arabic erotica , much of it written by religious scholars .
going right back to the prophet muhammad , there is a rich tradition in islam of talking frankly about sex : not just its problems , but also its pleasures , and not just for men , but also for women .
today , this history is largely unknown in the arab region .
but while the west has opened on sex , what we found is that arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction .
in egypt and many of its neighbors , this closing down is part of a wider closing in political , social and cultural thought .
and it is the product of a complex historical process , one which has gained ground with the rise of islamic conservatism since the late 1970s .
`` `` '' just say no '' '' is what conservatives around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo . ''
( laughter ) over my travels , i 've met men and women across the arab region who 've been exploring that spectrum — sexologists who are trying to help couples find greater happiness in their marriages , innovators who are managing to get sexuality education into schools , small groups of men and women , lesbian , gay , transgendered , transsexual , who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real-world support .
social change does n't happen in the arab region through dramatic confrontation , beating or indeed baring of breasts , but rather through negotiation .
daffodil hudson : hello ?
what ?
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , of course i accept .
what are the dates again ?
pen . pen . pen .
march 17 through 21 .

i choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation .
i have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections with an accessible medium , one that moves us in a way that statistics may not .
i draw with soft pastel , which is dry like charcoal , but colors .
it quiets my mind .
we rode camels in northern africa and mushed on dog sleds near the north pole .
one year after my trip to greenland , i visited the maldives , the lowest and flattest country in the entire world .
thank you .
and this was n't a pretty thing .
and with my albanian friends , we tried to stop it , but we failed .
now , if you want to do something that you do n't know how to do yourself , then this is going to be a great challenge .
so he came up with an idea : he had the computer play against itself thousands of times and learn how to play checkers .
so from this vantage point , i was able to find out a lot about what machine learning can do in the past , can do today , and what it could do in the future .
google showed that it is possible to find information by using a computer algorithm , and this algorithm is based on machine learning .
since that time , there have been many commercial successes of machine learning .
companies like amazon and netflix use machine learning to suggest products that you might like to buy , movies that you might like to watch .
these are algorithms that have learned how to do this from data rather than being programmed by hand .
`` this is also how ibm was successful in getting watson to beat the two world champions at `` '' jeopardy , '' '' answering incredibly subtle and complex questions like this one . ''
and in fact , this car has driven over a million miles without any accidents on regular roads .
this is geoffrey hinton here on the left-hand side .
( applause ) thank you .
it 's a single algorithm that can seem to do almost anything , and i discovered that a year earlier , it had also learned to see .
this is much like the way that humans learn .
also in 2012 , geoffrey hinton , who we saw earlier , won the very popular imagenet competition , looking to try to figure out from one and a half million images what they 're pictures of .
as of 2014 , we 're now down to a six percent error rate in image recognition .
deep learning now in fact is near human performance at understanding what sentences are about and what it is saying about those things .
this algorithm developed out of switzerland by people , none of whom speak or understand any chinese .
as i say , using deep learning is about the best system in the world for this , even compared to native human understanding .
these are pictures which have no text attached , and as i 'm typing in here sentences , in real time it 's understanding these pictures and figuring out what they 're about and finding pictures that are similar to the text that i 'm writing .
this is something that computers have only been able to do for the first time in the last few months .
so we put all this together and it leads to very exciting opportunities .
the theory is that we can take the middle part of the medical process and turn that into data analysis as much as possible , leaving doctors to do what they 're best at .
i want to give you an example .
sometimes , of course , even at this point it 's still difficult to separate out groups .
it 's managed to find a way of thinking about these objects that 's separated out these together .
where there are mistakes , we can let the computer know about them .
and using this kind of process for each of the different groups , we are now up to an 80 percent success rate in classifying the 1.5 million images .
so imagine if we can help enhance their efficiency using these deep learning approaches ?
these are also the exact things that computers have just learned how to do .
so 80 percent of the world 's employment in the developed world is stuff that computers have just learned how to do .
what does that mean ?
it 's very hard for us to estimate this , because human performance grows at this gradual rate , but we now have a system , deep learning , that we know actually grows in capability exponentially .
and we 're here .
we have seen this once before , of course .
so i want us to start having this discussion now .
( applause )
not only was i not moving a muscle , i had no social interaction with the hundreds of thousands of people that were hurtling past me , like me , with their eyes faced forward and their music blaring .
i wondered if this was an inevitable outcome , or could we do something about it .
but there we were , and it was kind of weird , but it was really , really powerful .
people on the lower end of the economic spectrum loved it , too .
that 's what people in atlanta do .
we 're building new lives for ourselves .
and this is all exciting and good .
we 're changing the world for the better .
the answer ca n't be to not build parks and transit and grocery stores .
thank you .
( applause )
this is me being inspired by my first tutor , my mom , and this is me teaching introduction to artificial intelligence to 200 students at stanford university .
now the students and i enjoyed the class , but it occurred to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern , the teaching technology is n't .
note the textbook , the sage on the stage , and the sleeping guy in the back . ( laughter ) just like today .
our typical video is two minutes , sometimes shorter , never more than six , and then we pause for a quiz question , to make it feel like one-on-one tutoring .
students learn best when they 're actively practicing .
that 's just what we were going for .
`` from daphne koller and andrew ng , we learned the concept of `` '' flipping '' '' the classroom . ''
i 'll do one in the fall .
we 're gathering thousands of interactions per student per class , billions of interactions altogether , and now we can start analyzing that , and when we learn from that , do experimentations , that 's when the real revolution will come .
our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human-computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do , but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences .
and what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain , our center for control and experience .
well , it sounds like a pretty good idea , but this task , as bruno mentioned , is n't an easy one for two main reasons : first , the detection algorithms .
when these neurons interact , the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse , which can be measured .
it 's also wireless , so it gives you the freedom to move around .
now , evan is new to this system , so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him .
`` he 's obviously not joanne — so we 'll `` '' add user . '' '' evan . okay . ''
he just hangs out . he 's relaxed .
it takes eight seconds to do this , and now that that 's done , we can choose a movement-based action .
`` evan grant : let 's do `` '' pull . '' '' tan le : okay , so let 's choose `` '' pull . '' '' so the idea here now is that evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen , and there 's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he 's doing that . ''
`` the first time , nothing will happen , because the system has no idea how he thinks about `` '' pull . '' '' but maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds . ''
so we have a little bit of time available , so i 'm going to ask evan to do a really difficult task .
same sort of drill . so : one , two , three , go .
okay . let 's try that .
good job . good job .
the technology can also be applied to real world applications — in this example , a smart home .
now blink left to turn back left .
( applause ) we are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today , and with the community 's input , and also with the involvement of developers and researchers from around the world , we hope that you can help us to shape where the technology goes from here . thank you so much .
i was awakened once during the night .
i 'm going to talk about how they 're useful when we reflect , learn , remember and want to improve .
now , we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle — the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices , the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing , and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors .
this tracks your activity and also your sleep .
it has just that sensor in it .
i just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor .
and nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
the rest of it is the bedside console ; just for reference , this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago — i mean , really until now .
and this is the sleep tracking system of today .
most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler , but the top is a very small gps transceiver , which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident , giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors .
the self is just our operation center , our consciousness , our moral compass .
let 's look at the next year , and you can see that that trend is continuing .
thank you .
`` finally , my favorite student , she looks me straight in the eye , and she says , `` '' the reading sucked . '' '' and then she clarified . she said , `` '' you know what , i do n't mean that it sucks . it means that i did n't understand a word of it . ''
the main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses .
these guys are blown up a couple million times .
`` but what a lot of people do n't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick . '' '' now , the story that i start telling my kids , it starts out like a horror story . ''
because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium .
the workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they 're following different instructions .
when a secret agent virus infects a bacterium , they do a little espionage .
so now we have a whole extended bacteria family , filled with virus sleeper cells .
it takes control of these cells , turns them into virus-making factories , and they all burst , a huge , extended bacteria family , all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts , the viruses taking over the bacterium .
on the [ right ] is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses .
so when my students were first learning this , why did they hate it so much ?
first of all , i can guarantee you that their textbooks did n't have secret agent viruses , and they did n't have horror stories .
you know , in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness .
`` i used to work for an educational publisher , and as a writer , i was always told never to use stories or fun , engaging language , because then my work might not be viewed as `` '' serious '' '' and `` '' scientific . '' '' right ? i mean , because god forbid somebody have fun when they 're learning science . ''
they have something called rna instead .
now , finally , i am often so disappointed when people think that i 'm advocating a dumbing down of science .
that 's not true at all .
but i think that 's unlikely .
there 's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple , understandable ways .
and i myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that i put on youtube .
the feedback that i get is sometimes misspelled and it 's often written in lolcats , but nonetheless it 's so appreciative , so thankful that i know this is the right way we should be communicating science .
`` why do n't you say , `` '' listen , let me tell you a story '' '' ? ''
( laughter ) and i 'm an academic , so i put audiences to sleep for free . ( laughter )
and it 's from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning , that pain is a disease .
and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it , i want to show you how it feels for my patients .
so imagine , if you will , that i 'm stroking your arm with this feather , as i 'm stroking my arm right now .
now what does it have to do with chronic pain ?
imagine i were to stroke your child 's arm with this feather , and their brain [ was ] telling them that they were feeling this hot torch .
the worst part was that she had allodynia , the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch .
how can the nervous system get this so wrong ? how can the nervous system
well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house .
if you hit your thumb with a hammer , these wires in your arm — that , of course , we call nerves — transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires , new nerves , take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt .
their dna starts to synthesize new proteins , which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves , and they start releasing their neurotransmitters , and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells , and so on and so forth , until what we have is a positive feedback loop .
well , what do we do about that ?
and most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life .
and we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency , despair and depression that always accompanies severe , chronic pain .
and i had lunch with her yesterday because she 's a college student studying dance at long beach here , and she 's doing absolutely fantastic .
the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem , as we have now , but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells , or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate , that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up , or plasticity , that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain .
so he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us .
it 's the same with brands : the more massive a brand , the more baggage it has , the more force is needed to change its positioning .
so the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction .
the act of observation changes it .
it 's the same in marketing .
think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group , and almost none of them buy lots of junk food .
so luckily , the science — no , sorry — the marketing is getting easier .
the marketing is — the message for marketing is — that try to measure what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they 'll do or anticipate they 'll do .
and only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water .
take bp — they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand , but then one little accident .
and the marketing is that not matter how much you 've invested in your brand , one bad week can undermine decades of good work .
so be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups that can undermine your brand .
with the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer , it 's impossible to control where it goes .
it 's out of your control . ( laughter )
so , this is the way it works .
weighs about eight pounds , and this is the way it works .
there 's a great big elephant in the room called the economy .
it turns out that b of a in september had 32 times .
and we 've got to end up with a smaller government .
you can freeze half its heart . it regrows .
you re-grow a set of teeth .
and the same thing is happening in eyes .
and then they 'll be able to see shape .
i photograph from a fixed vantage point , and i never move .
day to night is a global project , and my work has always been about history .
the boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then .
one of the things that 's great is i love to people-watch .
so once i decide on my view and the location , i have to decide where day begins and night ends .
now when i do these pictures , it 's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind .
but there were daunting challenges .
infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there .
i did n't voice my concerns loudly enough .
and i did everything i could for each and every patient of mine .
new york city 's not exceptional .
first , know your density .
i 'm ellen , and i 'm totally obsessed with food .
while i was working at the u.n. , i met this girl . her name is lauren bush .
`` and she had this really awesome idea to sell the bag called the `` '' feed bag '' '' — which is really beautifully ironic because you can strap on the feed bag . ''
here we have a story .
here 's where it happens .
it 's not considered vintage — she just likes certain music to sound a certain way .
`` `` i want to give you a hug . '' ''
i 'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes — for swearing , awkward silences , and very simple rhyme schemes .
i 'm a monkey — ( laughter ) — blowing kisses at a butterfly .
but i 'm still suggesting you and i should meet .
first , soon , and then a lot .
i do n't know what else to tell you .
and as you 're thinking about that , let me talk about that in the context of prosthetics , prosthetics past , present , future .
so this is the iron hand that belonged to one of the german counts .
or hugh will say what type of cliff do i want to climb ?
they 've become artificial hips .
and if you can do that , then you can begin changing fundamental aspects of humanity .
those are the order of magnitude of changes you 're talking about .
and at that point , somebody might actually want to have a prosthetic voluntarily .
and for that we turn to a great philosopher who was a very smart man despite being a yankee fan .
but while you 're at it , then you can take the work of craig venter and ham smith .
how would you want to enhance a human body ?
so what does that mean ?
drop it on the sun , you die .
not next week , not next month , maybe in november , but maybe 10,000 years after that .
and to borrow from nikolai kardashev , let 's think about life in a series of scales .
so life one civilization is a civilization that begins to alter his or her looks .
and we 've been doing that for thousands of years .
you 've got tummy tucks and you 've got this and you 've got that .
it means you can create alternate chemistries to us that could be chemistries adaptable to a very different planet that could create life and heredity .
if you do n't substitute two amino acids , if you do n't say atxy , if you say atcg + xy , then you go from 20 building blocks to 172 , and all of a sudden you 've got 172 building blocks of amino acids to build life-forms in very different shapes .
`` do you feel anything for this person ? '' '' we laugh about that today . ''
if you can get a mouse that is functional , then you can see , is the new brain a blank slate ?
and let 's come back to the first question : why would you ever want to do that ?
thank you very much .
( applause )
six thousand children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured .
these are just remarkable , remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers .
it 's a condition , or it 's a situation that leads to mortality .
what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is .
third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
it 's also morbidity .
if you look at disability , as measured by the world health organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years , it 's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist , except it 's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes , and as you can see , virtually 30 percent of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders , neuropsychiatric syndromes .
what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression ?
fifty percent will have onset by age 14 , 75 percent by age 24 , a picture that is very different than what one would see if you 're talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hypertension — most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality .
now , i started by telling you that there were some good-news stories .
this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult , and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me .
my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders .
actually , i work for you . you pay my salary .
that 's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days , and people feel that , for whatever reason , it 's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior .
fair enough . they are disorders of behavior , and they are disorders of the mind .
when we talk about the brain , it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic .
it depends , of course , on what scale or what scope you want to think about , but this is an organ of surreal complexity , and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it , whether you 're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections .
now , already in the case of the brain disorders that i 've been talking to you about , depression , obsessive compulsive disorder , post-traumatic stress disorder , while we do n't have an in-depth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses , we have been able to already identify some of the connectional differences , or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders .
here we 're talking about traffic jams , or sometimes detours , or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions .
as we think about this , probably it 's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder , and that would be schizophrenia , because i think that 's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters .
they 've crossed a brain threshold much earlier , that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 , but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain , not at the level of behavior .
if we waited until the heart attack , we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease .
that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders , brain circuit disorders , has a behavioral disorder .
thanks very much .
if you ask for help , you get more done . and we really need help .
that 's 500,000 more words . so that 's a lot .
because a word is like an archaeological artifact .
my revised dream led me to the work i do today : training immigrants to run for public office and leading a movement for inclusive democracy .
in that work , i became and advocate for south asians and other immigrants .
i volunteered on election day to do exit polling .
and once the application was submitted , there were fingerprints to be taken , a test to study for , endless hours of waiting in line .
my journey from international student to american citizen took 16 years , a short timeline when you compare it to other immigrant stories .
i had basically floundered in various jobs in america before i started a community-based organization in a church basement in queens .
and now i was going to represent their concerns in government .
no job felt more perfect for me .
what i learned in 2001 was that my vote mattered but that my voice and vantage point also mattered .
every one of our votes matters .
but the third most untapped resource in american democracy is the vantage point that immigrants bring .
we have come for political and religious freedom .
we have come in the pursuit of love .
and it 's not going to be easy .
and it 's a little scary .
so my optimism never wavers , because i know that there are millions of immigrants just like me , in front of me , behind me and all around me .
so my name is taylor wilson .
i decided i wanted to make a star .
so this is similar to the reaction of the proton chain that 's going on inside the sun .
instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities i 've developed a device that , on a very small scale , can produce these isotopes .
that is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor .
and this is me with president obama , showing him my homeland security research .
`` ( applause ) so in about seven years of doing nuclear research , i started out with a dream to make a `` '' star in a jar , '' '' a star in my garage , and i ended up meeting the president and developing things that i think can change the world , and i think other kids can too . ''
so thank you very much .
i could n't keep watching my oldest son make bad choices without being able to be there for him when and if he needed me .
i did n't want to miss the last five years that my sons were at home .
i still think we should do everything we possibly can to achieve that goal .
the companies that win awards for workplace flexibility in the united states include some of our most successful corporations , and a 2008 national study on the changing workforce showed that employees in flexible and effective workplaces are more engaged with their work , they 're more satisfied and more loyal , they have lower levels of stress and higher levels of mental health .
so making a place for those we love is actually a global imperative .
think about it : breadwinning and caregiving are equally necessary for human survival .
and we do n't typically challenge why men 's work is advantaged .
but consider a same-sex couple like my friends sarah and emily .
they 're psychiatrists .
so how are they going to divide up breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities ?
if breadwinning and caregiving are really equal , then why should n't a government invest as much in an infrastructure of care as the foundation of a healthy society as it invests in physical infrastructure as the backbone of a successful economy ?
men are still socialized to believe that they have to be breadwinners , that to derive their self-worth from how high they can climb over other men on a career ladder .
we should be socializing them to make caregiving cool for guys .
they are in the birthing rooms .
they can walk a baby or soothe a toddler just as well as their wives can , and they are increasingly doing much more of the housework .
and in norway , where men have an automatic three month 's paternity leave , but they lose it if they decide not to take it , a high government official told me that companies are starting to look at prospective male employees and raise an eyebrow if they did n't in fact take their leave when they had kids .
thirty years ago , carol gilligan , a wonderful psychologist , studied adolescent girls and identified an ethic of care , an element of human nature every bit as important as the ethic of justice .
`` it turns out that `` '' you do n't care '' '' is just as much a part of who we are as `` '' that 's not fair . '' '' bill gates agrees . ''
he argues that the two great forces of human nature are self-interest and caring for others .
let 's bring them both together .
it is happening .
it will happen .
thank you .
not that we could have afforded i drive , but to give me the dream of driving .
i am , and have been since birth , legally blind .
but more importantly , let me tell you — i 'm going to come up really close here . do n't freak out , pat .
the really strange part is that , at three and a half , just before i was going to school , my parents made a bizarre , unusual and incredibly brave decision .
so just like johnny cash 's sue , a boy given a girl 's name , i would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive , when they were no longer there to protect me , or just take it all away .
but more significantly , they gave me the ability to believe , totally , to believe that i could .
`` and do n't get me wrong , because when i first heard it — aside from the fact that i thought he was insane — i got that thump in my chest , just that `` '' huh ? '' '' but very quickly i recovered . it was like that . ''
`` you 're mad . i 'll drive . i know i can drive . '' '' and with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since i was such a child — he taught me how to sail , knowing i could never see where i was going , i could never see the shore , and i could n't see the sails , and i could n't see the destination . ''
and then i went to business school .
and then i went in and i got a global consulting job with accenture .
`` and i simply said , `` '' i 'm sorry . ''
but can i just tell you , the little sign for a gents ' toilet or a ladies ' toilet is determined by a triangle .
it 's such a small thing , right ?
and you know how exhausting it can be to try to be perfect when you 're not , or to be somebody that you are n't ?
and so after admitting i could n't see to hr , they sent me off to an eye specialist .
and i had no idea that this man was going to change my life .
i had no idea who i was anymore .
`` and i went home , and , because the pain in my chest ached so much , i thought , `` '' i 'll go out for a run . '' '' really not a very sensible thing to do . ''
i count the steps and the lampposts and all those things that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with .
broken , fallen over on this rock in the middle of march in 2000 , typical irish weather on a wednesday — gray , snot , tears everywhere , ridiculously self-pitying .
because who am i going to be ?
i had lost my belief .
and now i had lost it . and now i really could n't see .
what did you want to be when you were little ? do you love what you do ?
and it did happen this way .
and nobody can tell me no .
but you ca n't tell me , no , i ca n't be mowgli , because guess what ?
and so i got off that rock , and , oh my god , did i run home .
`` and i ran up the stairs , and there was one of my favorite books of all time , `` '' travels on my elephant '' '' by mark shand — i do n't know if any of you know it . ''
i know how to be mowgli .
i 'm going to go across india on the back of an elephant .
from global management consultant to elephant handler .
because , when you make a decision at the right time and the right place , god , that universe makes it happen for you .
and you know what , when you really believe in yourself and everything about you , it 's extraordinary what happens .
six thousand people got to see because of that .
i chucked in my job at accenture .
i left , and i became a social entrepreneur , and i set up an organization with mark shand called elephant family , which deals with asian elephant conservation .
that 's what i wanted to do .
it just seemed that it was possible .
but as i was traveling here , you 'll be very happy to know , i did use my white symbol stick cane , because it 's really good to skip queues in the airport .
this is me , all of me .
( applause ) and i have learned , you know what , cars and motorbikes and elephants , that 's not freedom .
i no longer want anybody to be invisible .
he actually was the first person to clone a dog , which is a very difficult thing to do , because dog genomes are very plastic .
( laughter ) in addition , we 've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species .
and i was really annoyed with them , and i thought , ok , i was about to write a strongly worded email , which i can do quite well .
`` so i replied to it , and i said , `` i literally can not wait ! ! ! ! '' ''
`` ( laughter ) `` what do you need from me ? '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' what 's the plan , dan ? ''
and on that axis i have life expectancy , the health of people .
can be worse , can be better .
some people nodding yes .
this led to open-heart surgery . this is the actual real email from my doctor right there .
we 're all teachers . we know learning is ugly .
i could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything .
how will they grow this curiosity ?
you see , i would argue that riley is a metaphor for all kids , and i think dropping out of school comes in many different forms — to the senior who 's checked out before the year 's even begun or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school 's classroom .
but if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry , we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day , and spark their imagination .
( applause )
the united states had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the manhattan project , and the idea was very straightforward : we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending world war ii that we 'd been involved in in europe and in the pacific .
we had a few nuclear weapons , two of which we dropped on japan , in hiroshima , a few days later in nagasaki , in august 1945 , killing about 250,000 people between those two .
but by 1949 , the soviet union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power , and they began to match what the united states had developed .
`` it 's a very difficult number to deal with , because what we 've done is we 've quote unquote `` '' decommissioned '' '' some of the warheads . ''
`` they 're still probably usable . they could be `` '' re-commissioned , '' '' but the way they count things , which is very complicated , we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before . ''
so we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world , but a very different set of circumstances .
and basically , we lived for all those years , and some might argue that we still do , in a situation of being on the brink , literally , of an apocalyptic , planetary calamity .
we were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym , which is mad .
it stands for mutually assured destruction .
so what we offered ourselves was a collection of things . i 'm just going to go skim through a few things , just to jog your memories .
that was the principle . you — there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us , and if you get under your desk , things would be ok .
or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground .
so the goal was to evacuate the target cities .
turns out that they had another idea behind it , even though this was — they were telling the public it was to save us .
the main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality .
this disconnect was never actually resolved .
although the scenario has changed very considerably , the fact is that we have n't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means .
so i 'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second .
first thing is that the global nuclear weapons , in the stockpiles that i showed you in those original maps , happen to be not uniformly secure .
and it 's particularly not secure in the former soviet union , now in russia .
they 're acquirable , let me put it that way .
the global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about 1,300 , at the low end , to about 2,100 metric tons .
well , there 's a lot of know-how out there .
there 's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts .
if you have an undergraduate degree in physics , i would suggest — although i do n't , so maybe it 's not even true — but something close to that would allow you , with the information that 's currently available , to actually build a nuclear weapon .
and they 're retaliation-proof .
the fourth element is that the high-value u.s. targets are accessible , soft and plentiful .
seven million ship cargo containers come into the united states every year .
and lebed came to the united states and told us that many , many — more than 80 of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable .
it was 9.8 feet long , weighed 8,800 pounds . you go down to your local rent-a-truck and for 50 bucks or so , you rent a truck that 's got the right capacity , and you take your bomb , you put it in the truck and you 're ready to go .
`` this is a 10-kiloton bomb , slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima . and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information . i think — `` '' news you could use '' '' kind of concept here . ''
an enormous hurricane-like wind , and destruction of buildings almost totally , within this yellow circle here .
you have , when the blast goes off — and by the way , if it ever comes up , do n't look at it .
and what happens is — this is — i 'm going to show you now some fallout plumes . within 20 minutes , it comes straight down . within 24 hours , lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds , and it 's mostly in this particular direction — it 's going northeast .
and if you 're in this vicinity , you 've got to get away .
if you do n't get out of there , you 're going to be exposed to lethal radiation in very short order .
but in 2008 , there is n't one single american city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster .
`` we can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things . '' '' so the goal here is to minimize fatalities . ''
and shelter and place . you want to move [ only ] crosswind for 1.2 miles .
and finally , you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible .
and you want something to work on once you 've fixed global warming , i urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable , inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world .
thank you .
crooked smile , tuft of chest hair , he showed up to world war ii , with a smirk and a hobby .
my father was born into this world of black and white .
once he traveled across the country to follow a forest fire , hunted it with his camera for a week .
the loft on wooster street with the creaky hallways , the twelve-foot ceilings , white walls and cold floors .
this was my mother 's home , before she was mother .
made it her home .
they got married . had a baby .
but they kept the loft on wooster street for birthday parties and treasure hunts .
the sweet potato boy mashed his fists into his mouth until he had nothing more to say .
on the other side of the country , i went to class and wrote a poem in the margins of my notebook .
maybe we are learning the art of embracing .
maybe we are learning the art of letting go .
but i 'm here tonight to tell you about something personal that changed my work and my perspective .
to give you some background on me , i grew up the youngest of eight .
yes , eight kids in my family .
to give you a sense of what that 's like , when my family went on vacation , we had a bus .
since then , i 've made a career of painting people in water .
bathtubs and showers were the perfect enclosed environment .
do n't do that .
my mom was diagnosed with lung cancer .
but i , too , wanted to do everything i could to help , so i wanted to try everything .
if before i was resisting , then now i was surrendering , giving up trying to control the uncontrollable and just being there in it with her .
she was gone .
i 'm so grateful for them .
so i packed up my car and i drove back to brooklyn , and painting is what i 've always done , so that 's what i did .
so i went into the woods .
i actually left one of these wet paintings outside overnight next to a light in the woods .
i got curious again .
it had to be about implying and suggesting , not explaining or describing .
and in that imperfection , you can find a vulnerability .
so here 's what i learned .
we 're all going to have big losses in our lives , maybe a job or a career , relationships , love , our youth .
let go of trying to change it or even wanting it to be different .
let 's take the opportunity to find something beautiful in the unknown , in the unpredictable , and even in the awful .
in my home , life was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil .
a man named david was one such person .
the truth is that the care shown to me by these strangers on the internet was itself a contradiction .
compromise is anathema .
the impulse to respond in kind is so tempting , but that is n't who we want to be .
at westboro , i learned not to care how my manner of speaking affected others .
we ca n't expect others to spontaneously change their own minds .
writing biography is a strange thing to do .
which might be why when i looked at the earliest accounts we have of that night , what struck me even more than what happened was what did not happen .
muhammad did not come floating off the mountain as though walking on air .
demanding perfection , they refuse to tolerate human imperfection .
doubly ironic , in this case , because their absolutism is in fact the opposite of faith .
and we 've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that no matter whether they claim to be christians , jews or muslims , militant extremists are none of the above .
this is n't faith .
it involves an ongoing struggle , a continual questioning of what we think we know , a wrestling with issues and ideas .
i 'm not convinced of this .
because despair is self-fulfilling .
in fact , most of us do , whether we 're atheist or theist or anywhere in between or beyond , for that matter , what drives us is that , despite our doubts and even because of our doubts , we reject the nihilism of despair .
call it impossibly idealistic if you must .
he 'd call out terrorism for what it is , not only criminal but an obscene travesty of everything he believed in and struggled for .
and he 'd commit himself fully to the hard and thorny process of making peace .

`` `` '' the business is on . ''

i have a son .
i 'm not an angel .
thelma nichols : inmate number 0b2472 .

why are there so many jobs ?
there are actually two fundamental economic principles at stake .
there 's a general principle here .
why are there so few farmers today ?
norway has invested to build a society with opportunity and economic mobility .
and this brings me to the challenge that we face today , the challenge that automation poses for us .
that is not my vision of progress , and i doubt that it is yours .
many of them would be unemployable .
these predictions strike me as arrogant .
( laughter ) i was pretty good in reading , but religion and musical appreciation needed more work . ( laughter )
and it brought me into contact with volunteers and helpers .
`` as one of them said to me , `` ron , we ai n't going anywhere at the moment . '' ''
in fact , in my office in 1990 , i had 18 miles of tape .
but i thank you here , lois , from this platform .
`` ( applause ) i saw my first apple computer in 1984 , and i thought to myself , `` this thing 's got a glass screen , not much use to me . '' ''
this now allowed me to read back what i 'd written and to enter the computer world , even with its 84k of memory .
optical character recognition units then only operated usually on one font , but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners and speech synthesizers , he developed a machine that could read any font .
( laughter ) i no longer would be censored .
for example , i was too shy then , and i 'm actually too shy now , to ask anybody to read me out loud sexually explicit material .
and now i can scan the latest novel and not wait to get it into talking book libraries .
ted was a motorcycle racer , but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight , which is devastating if you 're trying to ride motorbikes .
he then turned to being a waterskier and was a champion disabled waterskier .
can we play that one ?
do you love being read to ?
i 've indeed been a very fortunate human being .
bless you . thank you very much .
we put together , very quickly , a washroom .
wow , it 's almost a full house .
so how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective ?
why should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor ?
but what if your destination does n't have an exit on the highway ?
currently , the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer .
english is taking over .
why bother to learn another one when it 's getting to the point where almost everybody in the world will be able to communicate in one ?
that is a marvelously enticing idea , but it 's kind of fraught .
it 's hard not to love data like that , and many people will tell you that that means that there 's a worldview that you have if you speak one of those languages .
up on the screen , that is bono .
now , that is donald trump .
it 's a highly fraught concept .
one of them is that if you want to imbibe a culture , if you want to drink it in , if you want to become part of it , then whether or not the language channels the culture — and that seems doubtful — if you want to imbibe the culture , you have to control to some degree the language that the culture happens to be conducted in .
there 's no other way .
there 's an interesting illustration of this .
i have to go slightly obscure , but really you should seek it out .
there 's one scene closest to the end , where they have to take a friend to an anglophone hospital .
and these are factors that set in early , and so that ought to give you some sense of when to give junior or juniorette lessons in another language .
and then , third — languages are just an awful lot of fun .
all those things have in common the consonants sitting in the middle like pillars .
who would n't want to roll that around in their mouths ?
a language can do that to you .
`` so for example , `` the cat in the hat comes back , '' a book that i 'm sure we all often return to , like `` '' moby dick . '' '' one phrase in it is , `` '' do you know where i found him ? ''
and more to the point , we live in an era when it 's never been easier to teach yourself another language .
you had to go to class .
there was only so much data on a record , or a cassette , or even that antique object known as a cd .
other than that you had books that did n't work , that 's just the way it was .
you can give yourself your morning pleasures in various languages .
it 's an awful lot of fun .
the applications start rolling in , and the qualified candidates are identified .
but remember — both are qualified .
a resume tells a story .
eventually , he quit .
a remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered , which scientists call post traumatic growth .
eleven years later , when the political landscape changed , he heard about a highly selective university admissions test .
he had three months to learn the entire curriculum of middle and high school .
and i 'm going to tell you the secret .
and third , layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed .
most pages are destroyed soon after being written .
thus , the volumes of earth history are incomplete and disheveled .
it 's that you need to go to a place that 's a desert today , a place that does n't have too many plants covering up the rocks , and a place where erosion is always exposing new bones at the surface .
every pebble that you see on the ground there is a piece of dinosaur bone .
so can you imagine a big bull , 65-ton dreadnoughtus in the breeding season , defending a territory ?
and then , in east africa , an unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought .
these brainy primates were not particularly fast or strong .
i was that ape .
this easily might not have been .
but we only get one history , and it 's the one that we have .
the bones of dreadnoughtus lay underground for 77 million years .
the stream next to it runs a few hundred yards and ends in a small pond .
sea monsters like the mosasaur were real .
why study the ancient past ?
and now we 've evolved to the point where we ca n't survive without clothing .
so i put together a no-face costume , and i wore it on the floor at comic-con .
and i 'm feeling and i 'm walking the floor and it 's fantastic .
i do n't know why .
this is n't a performer-audience relationship ; this is cosplay .
thank you .
then , you also encrypt the data as it sits on the server itself .
if we want to have privacy online , what we have to do is we 've got to go out and get it ourselves .
so last summer , when the edward snowden story came out , several colleagues and i decided to see if we could make this happen .
well , it 's probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server .
so what do we have to do to solve this problem ?
we 're in the age of the super pac .
but now she was a septuagenarian , she 'd stopped driving .

she has amazing land speed for a woman her age , too .
i pull in . i put the car in park .
she 's got front seat in a greek tragedy .

i want to talk about the implications of that for the whole world .
they want their own preferences and order .
no , the kurds will do better , and iraq , israel , iran over time .
there are real leaders across asia , they have a lot of political stability .
so europe was able to truly expand under the g7 , but under the g-zero , europe will get smaller .
but the periphery , countries like greece and turkey and others , will not look that good at all .
we see it with the openness in cuba .
we will see it in venezuela when maduro falls .
the us election matters a lot on that one , too .
( laughter ) africa , right ?
those countries can fall off the map .
so you 're really going to see an extreme segregation going on between the winners and the losers across africa .
finally , back to the united states .
these are factors of large magnitude .
you know why ? because they ca n't swim here .
the jordanians , the germans , the brits . right ?
the election process this year is not proving a good option for leading by example .
well , either we have to have another crisis that forces us to respond .
maybe that sounds reasonable to you .
every month my wages would just replenish my overdraft .
obviously , this increases hiv risk .
it 's a pretty strong incentive to leave them at home , right ?
`` and he looked at the two of us and said , `` '' you girls ca n't call the cops . ''
how do you pay that fine without going back to the streets ?
but during a police crackdown on sex workers and their clients , she was forced to work alone to avoid being arrested .
can you afford not to ?
it creates a two-tiered system : legal and illegal work .
i do n't think this is an accident .
in a better , more equal world , maybe there would be far fewer people selling sex to survive , but you ca n't simply legislate a better world into existence .
people worry that selling sex is degrading .
people have all kinds of complicated feelings when it comes to sex .
why is n't she safer ?
after all , we 're the ones most affected by these laws .
it 's crucial to remember that decriminalization and legalization are not the same thing .
well , sex work is work , too .
so , ross and i researched the standard birth defects , and we felt reasonably prepared .
babies with this diagnosis typically die in utero or within a few minutes , hours or days of being born .
on march 23 , 2010 , the twins were born , and they were both born alive .
and i was so excited , i thought maybe i could write a letter or i could get a letter and learn about what happened .
two days later , i got a response from dr. arupa ganguly of the university of pennsylvania .
she also explained that thomas had a secret code name .
i know i did n't . i think i 'm a normal person .
and i 'd also like to ask you a favor .
i barely did it , because i found it boring and painful , and as a result , it took me another six weeks to get better .
my physical therapist has already set up a schedule for my particular therapy .
for 30 years of his life , he made false papers — never for himself , always for other people , and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed .
he quickly became the false papers expert of the resistance .
and it 's not a banal story — after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the '70s .
i was in high school and got a bad grade , a rare event for me , so i decided to hide it from my parents .
later , while checking my school bag , my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged .
but knowing my father , and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent , i found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun .
`` and then , suddenly , i went `` '' wow ! '' '' my father , a secret agent ? ''
he decided to tell it to me and i made a book , from which i 'm going to read you some excerpts later .
so , his story . my father was born in argentina .
the whole family came to settle in france in the '30s .
during that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was 15 .
`` well , they were out , but they were always in danger . the big `` '' jew '' '' stamp was still on their papers . ''
`` as a `` '' dyer , '' '' do you know how to bleach ink marks ? ''
that 's my father .
all the movements stopped at falsifying .
he started making rubber stamps .
he had made a simple calculation : in one hour he could make 30 forged documents .
`` if he had accepted payment , he would n't be able to say `` '' yes '' '' or `` '' no '' '' depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause . ''
then there were the emotional sacrifices : how can one live with a woman while having so many secrets ?
and then he would not come .
then one day he totally disappeared .
and while my half brother and sister thought they 'd been abandoned , orphaned , my father was making false papers .
after the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to palestine before the creation of israel .
my father helped those who resisted dictatorships in the dominican republic , haiti , and then it was the turn of brazil , argentina , venezuela , el salvador , nicaragua , colombia , peru , uruguay , chile and mexico .
then there was the vietnam war .
my father made false papers for the american deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the vietnamese .
my father watched , benevolently , of course , the demonstrations of the month of may , but his heart was elsewhere , and so was his time because he had over 15 countries to serve .
( laughter ) he was much younger in those days , and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting .
but , he agreed to do it , even though daniel cohn-bendit 's life was not in danger , just because it was a good opportunity to mock the authorities , and to show them that there 's nothing more porous than borders — and that ideas have no borders .
his name is adolfo kaminsky and i 'm going to ask him to stand up .
( applause ) thank you .
( laughter ) and it goes together without any bolts .
i loved our neighborhood .
it was home , and it was sweet .
but it was n't simple .
i spent much of my childhood worried , worried about our safety .
and so did our mother .
like , why would she do that ? i thought to myself .
it 's a kind of violence .
it 's the price that i and so many others pay for learning while black .
the cooperative children 's book center did a review of nearly 4,000 books and found that only three percent were about african-americans .
( applause ) it is possible to create emotionally and physically safe classrooms where students also thrive academically .
thank you .
well you can see where this is going .
so when we look at why it is that pixar is able to do what it does , we have to ask ourselves , what 's going on here ?
pilots are often about being right .
so this talk is for anyone who has ever loved .
adultery has existed since marriage was invented , and so , too , the taboo against it .
( laughter ) so how do we reconcile what is universally forbidden , yet universally practiced ?
now , monogamy used to be one person for life .
`` ( laughter ) ( applause ) i mean , many of you probably have said , `` i am monogamous in all my relationships . '' ( laughter ) ''
and alchemy is the key word here , because the erotic frisson is such that the kiss that you only imagine giving , can be as powerful and as enchanting as hours of actual lovemaking .
so it 's never been easier to cheat , and it 's never been more difficult to keep a secret .
and never has infidelity exacted such a psychological toll .
when marriage was an economic enterprise , infidelity threatened our economic security .
and i am it : i 'm chosen , i 'm unique , i 'm indispensable , i 'm irreplaceable , i 'm the one .
it is the ultimate betrayal .
`` and then another message : `` ca n't wait to hold you in my arms . '' ''
heather , she goes digging , and she finds hundreds of messages , and photos exchanged and desires expressed .
but then we have another paradox that we 're dealing with these days .
but what if passion has a finite shelf life ?
but for a glimmer of what ?
and with his truck and his tattoos , he 's quite the opposite of her .
they feel alive .
they 'll be able to turn this into a generative experience .
and that distinction is important .
and nick , he needs to hold vigil for the relationship .
sexual betrayal is only one way to hurt a partner .
but he knew about the cheap and simple one .
the car seat 's moving all over the place .
i spent three years talking to girls ages 15 to 20 about their attitudes and experience of sex .
`` `` '' i guess we girls are just socialized to be these docile creatures who do n't express our wants or needs . '' '' `` `` wait a minute , '' '' i replied . ''
girls would tell me that hair removal made them feel cleaner , that it was a personal choice .
`` `` no one wants to be talked about like that . '' ''
`` sara mcclellan , a psychologist at the university of michigan , coined what is my favorite phrase ever in talking about all of this : `` intimate justice . '' ''
`` and how does each partner define `` '' good enough '' '' ? ''
so we never say vulva , we certainly never say clitoris .
`` so i asked a gay girl that i met , `` how 'd you know you were n't a virgin anymore ? '' ''
now i know that 's not enough .
i want them to be able to revel in their bodies ' sensuality without being reduced to it .
i want them to be able to ask for what they want in bed , and to get it .
thank you .
so they wo n't go for a walk , they wo n't hang out with their friends , they wo n't eat .
they 'll develop fixations like chasing their tails compulsively .
he looks like he 's on a stakeout but he does this for many , many , many hours a day .
but by the time i got there , it was already nearly impossible to find stories about iraq on air .
there were less than one percent of all news stories in 2008 that went to the war in afghanistan .
syria is intimately tied to regional security , to global stability .
i felt like we could n't let that become another one of the stories we left behind .
but we can fix this .
our local journalists are our mentors .
it 's a choice .
news is adult education .
understanding complexity is the only way to know the real threats that are around the corner .
and they recapitulate that shape , even though that 's a circle of nine and that 's a circle of 36. it 's nuts .
eighteen and 19 , the middle of the moleeds , 0.618 is the golden section .
when people find out i write about time management , they assume two things .
i was once late to my own speech on time management .
and the idea is that we 'll shave bits of time off everyday activities , add it up , and we 'll have time for the good stuff .
you know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise ?
do n't watch two hours of tv a day , right ?
if you 've ever had anything like this happen to you , you know it is a hugely damaging , frightening , sopping mess .
`` `` could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people ? '' ''
`` you look back over your successes over the year , your `` '' opportunities for growth . '' '' and this serves its purpose , but i find it 's more effective to do this looking forward . ''
so i want you to pretend it 's the end of next year .
you 're giving yourself a performance review , and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally .
or maybe you want to run a 5k .
but anyway , just a short list , two to three items in each .
it is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class if you are caring for multiple children on your own .
twenty-four times seven is 168 hours .
you say you 're working 50 hours a week , maybe a main job and a side hustle .
well , that leaves 52 hours for other things .
( laughter ) you can guess in which direction , right ?
anyway , in 168 hours a week , i think we can find time for what matters to you .
pull out the phone , right ?
( applause )
and it 's called music .
this is a project i did for the sundance film festival .
i was there , too , with a film crew .
and i started looking for a corpus of data that had a lot of descriptions written by ordinary americans .
you can also see that nebraska ai n't that funny .
this will be your one takeaway from this whole conference .
they feel spiritual because it 's a heart opening , right ?
we risk vulnerability — this is something men do n't do .
`` i mean how many times have i asked you , `` '' am i doing ok ? '' '' `` did i really screw up there ? '' ''
pm : you 're doing great .
lt : well , that 's what 's exciting about this subject .
now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
and this is the plot behind stuxnet .
the payload goes onto the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the iranian nuclear program is delayed — mission accomplished .
i want to tell you how we found that out .
did n't make sense to me .
and after we experimented with different flavors of cheese , i realized , well , this is a directed attack .
the dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it 's trying to infect is actually running on that target .
so they know everything .
and if you have heard that the dropper of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you this : the payload is rocket science .
it 's way above everything that we have ever seen before .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
and then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world — to potential real world targets .
and that worked pretty well .
so we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control .
the big digital warhead — we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
i started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade , and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges .
and it even got better .
an almost identical structure .
now do n't get me wrong here , it did n't go like this .
these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target , but from different angles .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
but it gets worse .
it is generic .
is that your opinion ?
my opinion is that the mossad is involved , but that the leading force is not israel .
so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
ca : thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us . thank you , ralph .
isabel wijsen : a green paradise .
and you know what ?
our first attempts to get the government of bali on board failed .
iw : so to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world : go for it !
so , this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking .
we have frictionless motion . it is still levitating , but can move freely all around .
and i can even try a new thing ; let 's try it for the first time .
i think it 's the most technologically literate thing that we have , and i 'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way of communicating ideas through the body to audiences that might move them , touch them , help them think differently about things .
you know , it 's a distributed cognitive process in a way .
i work often with designers and visual artists , obviously dancers and other choreographers , but also , more and more , with economists , anthropologists , neuroscientists , cognitive scientists , people really who come from very different domains of expertise , where they bring their intelligence to bear on a different kind of creative process .
what i thought we would do today a little bit is explore this idea of physical thinking , and we 're all experts in physical thinking .
yeah , you all have a body , right ?
you absolutely know that when you 're going to grab a cup , or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it .
so we 're experts in physical thinking already .
but how is it that we can start to think about using choreographic thinking , kinesthetic intelligence , to arm the ways in which we think about things more generally ?
i 'm not sure if this is going to be good or not .
i thought what i 'd do is , i 'd use three versions of physical thinking to make something .
but what 's important about it is how it is that they 're grasping information , how they 're taking information , how they 're using it , and how they 're thinking with it .
i 'm going to start really , really simply .
yeah ? it 's absolutely there .
it has a kind of a grammar . i know what i 'm going to do with it , and i can start to describe it , so i can describe it very simply . i can describe it in my arms , right ?
i 'm not remembering what i 'm doing .
that 's it .
so we 're starting to build a phrase .
so what they 're doing , let 's see , something like that , so what they 're doing is grasping aspects of that movement and they 're generating it into a phrase .
you can see the speed is extremely quick , yeah ?
i 'm not asking them to copy exactly .
yeah , they 're super quick , right ?
some dancers , when they 're watching action , take the overall shape , the arc of the movement , the kinetic sense of the movement , and use that for memory .
okay , you 've got something ? one more thing .
okay . from there i 'm going to do a very different thing .
here we go , ready ? and ... bam , bake ... ( clicks metronome ) great . okay , from there , you 're both getting up .
you 're both getting up . here we go . good , now ? them .
whoa , underneath , whoo-um . yeah ? underneath . jump .
okay , let 's have a little go from the beginning of that .
yeah . just a little bit more , here we go , from that place .
avoid it . avoid it . whoom . kick it out of the way .
we 've got mental architecture , we 're sharing it , therefore solving a problem . they 're enacting it .
let me just see that a little bit . ready , and go .
ready and go ... um . ( clicks metronome ) ( clicks metronome ) the duet starts . ( clicks metronome ) ( clicks metronome ) so yeah , okay , good . okay , nice , very nice . ( applause ) so good . so — ( applause ) okay . so that was — ( applause ) well done . ( applause ) that was the second way of working .
i 'm going to think about it in 3d space . so now , instead of it just being a letter that 's in front of me , it 's a space that my body can go inside of .
`` i now decide where i 'm going to be in that space , so i 'm down on this small part of the bottom rib of the letter `` '' e , '' '' and i 'm thinking about it , and i 'm imagining this space that 's really high and above . if i asked you to reach out — you do n't have to literally do it , but in mind — reach out to the top of the `` '' e , '' '' where would you reach ? ''
if you reach with your finger , where would it be ?
if you reach with your elbow , where would it be ?
so they 've been working on those mental architectures in the here .
okay ? okay . ladies and gentlemen , world premiere , ted dance , three versions of physical thinking . ( applause ) well , clap afterwards , let 's see if it 's any good , yeah ? ( laughter ) so yeah , let 's clap — yeah , let 's clap afterwards .
thank you very much . ( applause ) thank you . thank you . ( applause ) here we go . ( applause ) ( applause )
i want to start by doing an experiment .
actually , i lied .
`` in `` '' the decay of lying , '' '' oscar wilde establishes the idea that all bad art comes from copying nature and being realistic ; and all great art comes from lying and deceiving , and telling beautiful , untrue things . ''
breaking celery or frozen lettuce .
( water splashes ) and pitched it down another octave .
( water splashes at lower octave ) and then they added a little bit of the splash from the overhead microphone .
so this is the first audio tool i want to talk about .
so silence preceding verbal communication can create a lot of tension .
silence can place us inside the head of a character or provoke thought .
but i want to make it clear : there is no such thing as silence .
they can speak directly to our brain subconsciously .
( glass breaks ) scientists believe that dissonant sounds , for example , brass or wind instruments played very loud , may remind us of animal howls in nature and therefore create a sense of irritation or fear .
richard wagner famously created the hidden orchestra that was placed in a pit between the stage and the audience .
also , it can minimize certain visual restrictions that directors have and can show something that was n't there during filming .
so what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
on the side here , this is temporal cortex .
it 's the place where you 're deciding right now you probably are n't going to order the steak for dinner .
and that 's shown here in the the very light blue .
you can see areas where neuronal cell bodies are being stained .
it 's one continuous processing unit , if you will .
they 're storing it , they 're processing it .
the unique character of both individual neurons and neurons within a collection of the brain are driven by fundamental properties of their underlying biochemistry .
they 're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement .
we each have 23 pairs of chromosomes .
and on these chromosomes are roughly 25,000 genes .
and we 're very careful about the brains that we do take .
we 're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue , we can get consent to take the tissue within 24 hours of time of death .
males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life .
it 's a standard template by which we 're going to hang the rest of this data .
and you can think of this as our satellite view for our map .
this maps the large cabling in the brain .
the brain is removed from the skull , and then it 's sliced into one-centimeter slices .
and those are frozen solid , and they 're shipped to seattle .
you could consider this state boundaries , if you will , those pretty broad outlines .
and this is just showing this here — this frozen tissue , and it 's being cut .
and so you can see here , old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied .
we take a microscope slide .
this will then go onto a robot that 's going to apply one of those stains to it .
this is a more detailed map .
they scribe along a place there .
we take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray .
now this may look like a bunch of dots to you , but each one of these individual dots is actually a unique piece of the human genome that we spotted down on glass .
this area shown here is an area called the hippocampus .
so each sample gets us about 50,000 data points with repeat measurements , a thousand samples .
they do n't even have to log in to come use this tool , mine this data , find interesting things out with this .
genes send the instructions to make proteins .
so drugs bind to proteins and either turn them off , etc .
we can do that in multiple individuals that we 've assayed too .
we can see this unique fingerprint .
we get confirmation that , indeed , the gene is turned on — for something like prozac , in serotonergic structures , things that are already known be affected — but we also get to see the whole thing .
so if you 're in drug discovery , for example , you can go through an entire listing of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize .
and i think every human , we all have different genetic backgrounds , we all have lived separate lives .
and what we 're finding is actually , even at the brain biochemical level , we are quite similar .
disc1 is a gene that 's deleted in schizophrenia .
whether or not that 's due to an individual 's genetic background or their experiences , we do n't know .
they give researchers a handle on where to go .
thanks .
( applause )
my secret was that i had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who i thought was my soulmate , many , many times .
not exactly .
i was also a very typical victim because i knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns .
i met conor on a cold , rainy january night .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
and he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he 'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
if you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not i wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where i lived , what jobs i took , who my friends were and where i spent christmas , i would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in conor at the beginning .
he kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times .
conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
it was 7 a.m. i still had on my nightgown .
five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and i put on my mother 's wedding dress , and i married him .
despite what had happened , i was sure we were going to live happily ever after , because i loved him , and he loved me so much .
and he was very , very sorry .
it happened twice more on the honeymoon .
the first time , i was driving to find a secret beach and i got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver 's side window .
one in three american women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life , and the cdc reports that 15 million children are abused every year , 15 million .
back to my question : why did i stay ?
the answer is easy .
even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as i drove down the highway , poured coffee grinds on my head as i dressed for a job interview , i never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
i remarried a kind and gentle man , and we have those three kids .
it 's my way of helping other victims , and it 's my final request of you .
so that 's what those great meditators have been doing .
hopefully , they will come .
it 's easy to forget that last night , one billion people went to sleep without access to electricity .
but even in our own world , the developed world , we see the tension of stagnant economies impacting the lives of people around us .
we see that in the sanders/trump campaigns in my own country .
our most recent move is the paris treaty , and the resulting climate agreements that are being ratified by nations around the world .
the unfortunate thing is that now , as we look at the independent analyses of what those climate treaties are liable to yield , the magnitude of the problem before us becomes clear .
the second thing you should notice is that the bulk of the growth comes from the developing countries , from china , from india , from the rest of the world , which includes south africa and indonesia and brazil , as most of these countries move their people into the lower range of lifestyles that we literally take for granted in the developed world .
china has made the choice , and will make the choice , to run on coal .
china has many fewer choices and a much harder row to hoe .
it did n't do rural electrification .
it urbanized .
so what can we do to stop coal 's emissions in time ?
what we need is a choice .
what about humans ?
and of those , eight million were indigenous lands .
first , because 15 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation , so it 's a big part of the problem .
now it 's a little bit less than 30 percent .
so if we can tackle directly the energy , the same way we could tackle deforestation , maybe we can have a chance .
first , we need to disconnect development from carbon emissions .
`` the word is `` '' misfit . '' '' it 's one of my favorite words , because it 's so literal . ''
and i 'm here for the other misfits in the room , because i 'm never the only one .
who was i ?
i was a misfit .
i already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt .
i 'd flunked out of college not once but twice and maybe even a third time that i 'm not going to tell you about .
you got set up at the gramercy park hotel , where you got to drink scotch late in the night with cool , smart , swank people .
and you got to pretend you were cool and smart and swank , too .
and i shoved a menu down my pants .
i mean , t.s . eliot and flannery o'connor were published there .
so in the end , he patted me on the shoulder like a swim coach might .
you get it ?
on the last night , i gave a big reading at the national poetry club .
`` and she said , `` '' ok , then , '' '' and walked away . ''
memory was the only prize i allowed myself .
but 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs .
we do n't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
that does not hold for emotions .
now , i 'll tell you another little , very important story about this picture .
i picked this up at mit . it 's a little younger .
and it 's different than this limestone , you can see that .
thank you very much .
it 's thicker , it 's darker , it 's coarser , it does n't have the contours .
science , we generally are told , is a very well-ordered mechanism for understanding the world , for gaining facts , for gaining data , that it 's rule-based , that scientists use this thing called the scientific method and we 've been doing this for 14 generations or so now , and the scientific method is a set of rules for getting hard , cold facts out of the data .
i 'd like to tell you that 's not the case .
so what was the difference ?
`` well , the course i was and am teaching is called cellular and molecular neuroscience - i . ( laughs ) it 's 25 lectures full of all sorts of facts , it uses this giant book called `` '' principles of neural science '' '' by three famous neuroscientists . ''
( laughter ) so i began to realize , by the end of this course , that the students maybe were getting the idea that we must know everything there is to know about the brain .
and that 's not really the case either .
it is , if you will , the ignorance .
so i thought , well , maybe i should teach a course on ignorance , something i can finally excel at , perhaps , for example .
that 's another story , perhaps .
divide that by the number of minutes in a year , and you wind up with three new papers per minute .
i have to get out of here actually . i have to go read .
the facts are important . you have to know a lot of stuff to be a scientist . that 's true .
but knowing a lot of stuff does n't make you a scientist .
you need to know a lot of stuff to be a lawyer or an accountant or an electrician or a carpenter .
knowing a lot of stuff is there to help you get to more ignorance .
so one of them , a popular one , is that scientists are patiently putting the pieces of a puzzle together to reveal some grand scheme or another .
we do n't have any such guarantee .
indeed , there are many of us who are n't so sure about the manufacturer .
another popular model is that science is busy unraveling things the way you unravel the peels of an onion .
as it turns out , he kind of cribbed that from the philosopher immanuel kant who a hundred years earlier had come up with this idea of question propagation , that every answer begets more questions .
`` i love that term , `` '' question propagation , '' '' this idea of questions propagating out there . ''
what are we using this collection of facts for ?
we 're using it to make better ignorance , to come up with , if you will , higher-quality ignorance .
this graph asks the relationship between what you know and how much you know about it .
so let 's put a point on the graph . there 's an undergraduate .
does n't know much but they have a lot of interest .
now you look at a master 's student , a little further along in their education , and you see they know a bit more , but it 's been narrowed somewhat .
so that maybe is not that interesting .
how about the visual system ?
i mean , we love our visual systems . we do all kinds of cool stuff .
you ask them to go up an inclined plane , and they fall over .
turn around , and they fall over . it 's a serious problem .
but here 's a diagram of five molecules and sort of a chemical notation .
what 's the process by which that could happen ?
here 's another example : two very simple molecules , again in this kind of chemical notation .
one is , how can a simple little molecule like that create a perception in your brain that 's so clear as a pear or a banana ?
and secondly , how the hell can we tell the difference between two molecules that differ by a single carbon atom ?
so this is a favorite quote of mine that takes us back to the ignorance and the idea of questions .
and it 's this abiding by ignorance that i think we have to learn how to do .
i guess it comes down to our education system , so i 'm going to talk a little bit about ignorance and education , because i think that 's where it really has to play out .
they 're available with a click of the mouse , or if you want to , you could probably just ask the wall one of these days , wherever they 're going to hide the things that tell us all this stuff .
how do we do that ?
we currently have an educational system which is very efficient but is very efficient at a rather bad thing .
and that 's meant as a warning .
well , we hear a lot about testing and evaluation , and we have to think carefully when we 're testing whether we 're evaluating or whether we 're weeding , whether we 're weeding people out , whether we 're making some cut .
it amounts to a chance to work over a longer period of time with this kind of feedback .
the situation in the cerrado made me realize — it gave me the sense of urgency .
and also start with a little bit of statistics .
and there are different ways .
they come to us with a request for a loan .
we started our media lab , sounds like a real great story .
that is not too much , is it ?
and those can be environmental bonds .
civilization as we know it has ceased to exist — no books , no electronic devices , no facebook or twitter .
all knowledge of the english language and the english alphabet has been lost .
in fact , what archeologists have found is none of that .
well obviously this is a replica .
a priest ?
we do n't know .
but the indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them .
in fact , the script has become a battleground of sorts between three different groups of people .
some things are not right , and you 'll say these words are probably not english words .
and what seems to have happened here is that the indus traders , the merchants , were using this script to write a foreign language .
can you write it using pictures ?
got it ?
you have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures such that the entire sequence makes sense .
it looks like we 're getting somewhere .
but does this prove that these seals contain dravidian names based on planets and star constellations ?
( applause )
so you might ask , why did we design this robot ?
a third component are central pattern generators .
so among all these animals , one of my favorites is the salamander .
but they are .
hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated at the time of the accident , but not everybody accepted that fate .
the women in the zone , now in their 70s and 80s , are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities and , it would seem , common sense , and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone .
they did so illegally .
`` otherwise , i 'm going home . '' '' now why would they return to such deadly soil ? ''
i mean , were they unaware of the risks or crazy enough to ignore them , or both ?
`` ( laughter ) and she said to me , when i asked her the obvious , `` radiation does n't scare me . starvation does . '' ''
so they returned to their villages and are told they 're going to get sick and die soon , but five happy years , their logic goes , is better than 10 stuck in a high rise on the outskirts of kiev , separated from the graves of their mothers and fathers and babies , the whisper of stork wings on a spring afternoon .
wild boar , lynx , moose , they 've all returned to the region in force , the very real , very negative effects of radiation being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus of humans .
now , like many of you , i have moved maybe 20 , 25 times in my life .
and perhaps because these ukrainian women were schooled under the soviets and versed in the russian poets , aphorisms about these ideas slip from their mouths all the time .
blue curtain .
are we there yet ?
josh .
somi .
most old people in the u.s. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years , and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly , whereas in traditional societies , older people instead live out their lives among their children , their other relatives , and their lifelong friends .
at the worst extreme , many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways : by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die , or by abandoning them when the group moves , or by encouraging older people to commit suicide , or by killing older people .
in which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents ?
one is in nomadic , hunter-gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who ca n't walk when the able-bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions .
to us americans , it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father , but what could those traditional societies do differently ?
and they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children , relatives and lifelong friends .
there are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people .
first , as regards usefulness , older people continue to perform useful services .
finally , older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern , literate societies , where our sources of information are books and the internet .
in contrast , in traditional societies without writing , older people are the repositories of information .
the other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society 's cultural values .
for example , there 's particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in east asia , associated with confucius ' doctrine of filial piety , which means obedience , respect and support for elderly parents .
cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the u.s .
that sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited , for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant , or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients , american hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them , even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them .
still a third reason is our american cult of youth , which shows up even in our advertisements .
changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past .
hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth .
widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge .
conversely , i at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life .
my family 's first tv set in 1948 had only three knobs that i quickly mastered : an on-off switch , a volume knob , and a channel selector knob .
today , just to watch a program on the tv set in my own house , i have to operate a 41-button tv remote that utterly defeats me .
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children .
compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers , grandparents offer superior , motivated , experienced child care .
a second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology .
conversely , valuable attributes that increase with age include experience , understanding of people and human relationships , ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way , and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases , such as economics and comparative history , best left to scholars over the age of 60 .
i 've seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s , 70s , 80s and 90s , who are still active as investment managers , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
thank you .
i 'm not even the more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous kind .
`` whereas some of you might have thought , `` hmm , black would have been so much more slimming . '' ''
these judgments are insidious .
i also receive smiles from strangers who recognize what it takes to walk down the street with a spring in your step and your head held high .
( cheer ) thanks .
instead , we value mental health , self-worth and how we feel in our bodies as vital aspects to our overall well-being .
there are fat athletes who run marathons , teach yoga or do kickboxing , all done with a middle finger firmly held up to the status quo .
when director kate champion , of acclaimed dance theater company force majeure , asked me to be the artistic associate on a work featuring all fat dancers , i literally jumped at the opportunity .
`` `` '' what do you mean , 'fat dancers ? ' like , size 10 , size 12 kind of fat ? ''
`` are they going to have the stamina for a full-length production ? '' '' but despite the skepticism , `` '' nothing to lose '' '' became a sellout hit of sydney festival . ''
thank you .
what i 'm pitching you today is actually not a stand-alone product .
less complex , more efficient , more bang for the buck .
and we asked ourselves the question : what makes these systems resilient and enduring ?
this beautiful building is part of the shitennoji temple complex in osaka , japan .
in fact , it 's one of the oldest temples in japan .
amazingly , his company , kongō gumi , was still around 1,428 years later .
in fact , it became the oldest continuously operating company in the world .
`` as the ceo , mr. komori , put it , the strategy succeeded because it had `` '' more pockets and drawers '' '' than the rivals . ''
from having no braking valves to complete recovery in five days .
now fortunately , few companies succumb to catastrophic fires .
it acquires those technologies very early , before they 've become expensive or competitors have mobilized around them , and it then develops those technologies itself , even at the risk of failure or the risk of self-disruption .
it 's a little like the difference between throwing a ball and releasing a bird .
thank you very much .
because this book is actually a prayer book .
he took apart the archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts .
he wanted to make that which was expensive free .
because not many people are really going to read archimedes in ancient greek , but they should have the chance to do it .
so he gathered around himself the friends of archimedes , and he promised to pay for all the work .
and it was an expensive job , but actually it would n't be as much as you think because these people , they did n't come from money , they came from archimedes .
they came from particle physics , they came from classical philology , they came from book conservation , they came from ancient mathematics , they came from data management , they came from scientific imaging and program management .
and this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with : there was glue on the spine of the book .
and this is a rare action shot , ladies and gentlemen .
it 's hard to tell you exactly how bad this condition of this book is , but it came out in little bits very often .
then , having done that , we started to image the manuscript .
and here are two different images of the archimedes manuscript .
the archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another .
and this is terribly important , because the diagrams in the manuscript are the unique source for the diagrams that archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century b.c .
with this kind of imaging — this kind of infrared , ultraviolet , invisible light imaging — we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries .
well we took the manuscript , and we decided to image it in x-ray fluorescence imaging .
so we took it to the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory in california , which is a particle accelerator .
but we wanted it to look at atoms , at iron atoms , so that we could read the page from before and after .
it took about 17 minutes to do a single page .
`` well one of the unique texts in archimedes is called `` '' the stomachion . '' '' and this did n't exist in codices a and b . ''
he was trying to work out how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits and still make a perfect square .
anyone want to guess the answer ?
and combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics .
the really astonishing thing though about this manuscript is that we looked at the other manuscripts that the palimpsester had made , the scribe had made his book out of , and one of them was a manuscript containing text by hyperides .
so athens and thebes went out to fight philip of macedon .
alexander the great went on to conquer the known world ; hyperides found himself on trial for treason .
`` and this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial — and it 's a great speech : `` '' best of all , '' '' he says , `` '' is to win . ''
they won enumerable victories , but no one remembers what they are because they were all fought for selfish ends .
he lived for another 10 years , then the macedonian faction caught up with him .
now i should say at this point that normally when you 're looking at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off , you do n't find unique texts .
and to find two in one manuscript is really something .
`` aristotle 's `` '' categories '' '' is one of the foundational texts of western philosophy . ''
now all this data that we collected , all the images , all the raw images , all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing have been put online under a creative commons license for anyone to use for any commercial purpose .
( applause ) why did the owner of the manuscript do this ?
he did this because he understands data as well as books .
now the thing to do with books , if you want to ensure their long-term utility , is to hide them away in closets and let very few people look at them .
the thing to do with data , if you want it to survive , is to let it out and have everybody have it with as little control on that data as possible .
what you want to do is to aggregate it all together .
what 's in it for the institution ?
they go to see the mona lisa .
because they already know what she looks like .
and they know what she looks like because they 've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere .
now , there is no need for these restrictions at all .
and i think that institutions should stand up and release all their data under unrestricted licenses , and it would be a great benefit to everybody .
today i 'd like to explore with you why the answer to this question will become profoundly important in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset .
i caught up with him recently , where , over the course of several cups of tea , he told me how hosting guests from all over the world has enriched his life .
and so sebastian bought squeak to protect his reputation .
it 's a fantastic example of how technology is creating a market for things that never had a marketplace before .
this image here is from 2008 .
now the same view in 2010 .
now , what 's happening here is people are realizing the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity and value of all kinds of assets , from skills to spaces to material possessions , in ways and on a scale never possible before .
they 're empowered to make money and save money from their existing assets .
it 's using the power of technology to build trust between strangers .
this side of airbnb really hit home to sebastian last summer during the london riots .
meet 46-year-old chris mok , who has , i bet , the best job title here of superrabbit .
at the time , she did n't realize that she was actually hitting on a bigger idea she later called service networking .
but i love that the number one task posted , over a hundred times a day , is something that many of us have felt the pain of doing : yes , assembling ikea furniture . ( laughter ) ( applause ) it 's brilliant . now , we may laugh , but chris here is actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month running errands around his life .
i think taskrabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption are like lemonade stands on steroids . they 're just brilliant .
now , when you think about it , it 's amazing , right , that over the past 20 years , we 've evolved from trusting people online to share information to trusting to handing over our credit card information , and now we 're entering the third trust wave : connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds of people-powered marketplaces .
how to ensure our digital identities reflect our real world identities ? do we want them to be the same ?
you can see that over 200 people have given him an average rating over 4.99 out of 5 .
now — ( laughter ) — i love that word , superrabbit .
in other words , for superrabbits , reputation has a real world value .
this year , two billion dollars worth of loans will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms .
what i mean by this is , say he started selling second-hand books on amazon . why should he have to start from scratch ?
now , i realize that this concept may sound a little big brother to some of you , and yes , there are some enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve , but ultimately , if we can collect our personal reputation , we can actually control it more , and extract the immense value that will flow from it .
just think of sebastian and how he bought the cat to influence his .
a three-digit score , your traditional credit history , that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is , will no longer be the determining factor in how much things cost , what we can access , and , in many instances , limit what we can do in the world .
now the interesting thing is , reputation is the socioeconomic lubricant that makes collaborative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be generated from , and its applications , are far bigger than this space alone .
this site receives five and a half thousand questions a day , and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers .
people are starting to realize that the reputation they generate in one place has value beyond the environments from which it was built .
you know , it 's very interesting .
now at the end of my tea with sebastian , he told me how , on a bad , rainy day , when he has n't had a customer in his bookstore , he thinks of all the people around the world who 've said something wonderful about him , and what that says about him as a person .
you know , there are only a few windows in history where the opportunity exists to reinvent part of how our socioeconomic system works .
i believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution that will be as significant as the industrial revolution .
in the 20th century , the invention of traditional credit transformed our consumer system , and in many ways controlled who had access to what .
yet we consider it a taboo .
`` it 's called `` '' pop-it , '' '' and it 's about the things little kids do with their parents . ''
you can tickle the rug .
but you know , i have a problem with children 's books : i think they 're full of propaganda .
at least an indian trying to get one of these american books in park slope , forget it .
you do n't like it ?
shake it , and you have a lesbian couple .
i went to this very proper christian school taught by nuns , fathers , brothers , sisters .
babri masjid — one of the most beautiful mosques in india , built by king babur , i think , in the 16th century — was demolished by hindu activists .
this caused major riots in my city .
imagine history being taught differently .
remember that children 's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change ?
i have another idea .
even my books on children have cute , fuzzy animals .
and my argument [ is ] that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage .
i 'm making an argument that art and creativity are very essential tools in empathy .
you know , i ca n't promise my child a life without bias — we 're all biased — but i promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives .
hi . i 'm kevin allocca , i 'm the trends manager at youtube , and i professionally watch youtube videos .
it 's true .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world 's culture .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
( laughter ) this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
but he did n't actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that 's what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
so what happened here ?
( video ) rebecca black : ♫ it 's friday , friday . got ta get down on friday . ♫ ♫ everybody 's looking forward to the weekend , weekend . ♫ ♫ friday , friday . gettin ' down on friday . ♫ ka : so you did n't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope .
it 's been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
it 's been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
because we do n't just enjoy now , we participate .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
jean-baptiste michel : so how did we get to this conclusion ?
this is the bop .
each dance has steps that everyone can agree on , but it 's about the individual and their creative identity .
slapping thighs , shuffling feet and patting hands : this was how they got around the slave owners ' ban on drumming , improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did with drums in haiti or in the yoruba communities of west africa .
the charleston was all about improvisation and musicality , making its way into lindy hop , swing dancing and even the kid n play , originally called the funky charleston .
but in the late '50s , right before the civil rights movement , the twist is popularized by chubby checker and dick clark .
through social dance , the boundaries between groups become blurred .
why do we dance ?
we , the beneficiaries of globalization , seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make , and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves .
after all , what 's wrong with a world in which a worker on an iphone assembly line ca n't even afford to buy one ?
it 's taken for granted that chinese factories are oppressive , and that it 's our desire for cheap goods that makes them so .
in the ongoing debate about globalization , what 's been missing is the voices of the workers themselves .
here are a few .
`` i told them that i studied and worked hard . if you tell them more , they wo n't understand anyway . '' '' wu chunming : `` '' even if i make a lot of money , it wo n't satisfy me . ''
`` only much later did i realize that she had been saying `` '' qc , '' '' or quality control . ''
unlike , say , a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets , the worker in an industrial factory has no control , no pleasure , and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work .
but like so many theories that marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the british museum , he got this one wrong .
journalistic coverage of chinese factories , on the other hand , plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make .
many articles calculate : how long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he 's making ?
but how meaningful is this calculation , really ?
how long should i stay in this factory ?
`` min 's sister turned to him and said , `` '' some people actually understand these things . you do n't understand shit . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) in min 's world , the coach bags had a curious currency . ''
they were n't exactly worthless , but they were nothing close to the actual value , because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one , or knew how much it was worth .
`` they were fresh , functional , and women everywhere adored them . a new american classic was born . '' '' i wonder what karl marx would have made of min and her sisters . ''
and yet , his view of the world persists , and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses , to imagine that we can know what they 're really thinking .
when i first went to dongguan , i worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers .
i also worried that nothing would ever happen to them , or that they would have nothing to say to me .
instead , i found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous .
their parents are often illiterate , and then they come to the city , and they , on their own , at night , during the weekends , they 'll take a computer class , they 'll take an english class , and learn really , really rudimentary things , you know , like how to type a document in word , or how to say really simple things in english .
so , if you really want to help these workers , start these small , very focused , very pragmatic classes in these schools , and what 's going to happen is , all your workers are going to move on , but hopefully they 'll move on into higher jobs within apple , and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement .
`` they do not say , `` '' i want better hot water in the showers . ''
`` i want a nicer room . i want a tv set . '' '' i mean , it would be nice to have those things , but that 's not why they 're in the city , and that 's not what they care about . ''
lc : oh definitely , definitely . i mean , you know , it was interesting , because i spent basically two years hanging out in this city , dongguan , and over that time , you could see immense change in every person 's life : upward , downward , sideways , but generally upward .
and i faced this contradiction in myself , and i joined with other activists in my community .
we started podcasting , blogging , writing articles .
these seem like simple things , but to us , the organizers , they were enormously costly .
and i began to expect this reaction from my own people .
it leaks into education , military , fiscal decision-making .
how many lives did that affect ?
religions ca n't be dismissed or ignored .
my daughter and my nieces are inheriting a religion that i never had , that 's more equal — we 've had an effect .
i 'm working on my people . what are you doing for yours ?
it 's not about mythology , or mythologizing myself to you .
the heads-up display is a smartphone that displays system parameters .
`` and `` beatjazzers '' become as common as d.j. 's . ''
all right . i understand . if you 're unwilling to — all right , well , we can discuss that after class .
okay honey , now , i 'm ready when you are .
so , like , hello , bert person of the future who is experiencing me .
pshh , you know how hard it is being a domestic worker ?
right . well , for me though , it was , as a girl , it started with me dad .
well , it was n't pretty woman , i can tell you that .
yeah . totally .
but they loved it , and so did we .
now , when you 're faced with a problem , you fall back on what you know , and all we really knew was design .
it 's hard for people to leave bad reviews .
the research showed , not surprisingly , we prefer people who are like us .
now , that 's a natural social bias .
we use the size of the box to suggest the right length , and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing .
we bet our whole company on the hope that , with the right design , people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias .
this is a graph that shows our rate of adoption .
turns out , people are justified in their trust .
they donated their own blood for his operation .
so let 's be clear ; it is about commerce .
tonight , just on our service , 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger 's home or welcome one into theirs .
so , why did ours eventually take off ?
( music ) beauty and seduction is nature 's tools for survival , because we protect what we fall in love with .
it 's the only gift that you have right now , and the only appropriate response is gratefulness .
but what happened when we looked inside the pig 's heart , to the electrogram ?
that 's not very nice , but , after all , we had to find out what the answer is .
anchor : for anyone who suffers from migraine headaches — and there are 30 million americans who do — tonight : a possible answer .
ss : researchers are hoping to present their studies to the fda this summer .
and it 's a kind of rope-like structure that twirls and swirls like this .
decided to make a paintbrush .
so i have to be very quick .
and that 's 24-karat gold . and it 's constructed . i built it .
there are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
more recently , if you 've been following the kenyan press — ( laughter ) ( applause ) ( cheers ) — these are the attributes that they associated the kenyan mps with . but i want to challenge that .
they help to kill all the bacteria . they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals .
they have been associated in ancient egyptian culture .
this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in india , and they have taken a stand .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it 's not going to help you .
we need to work with governments in regional levels .
today , i want to show you a new kind of map .
what do you call the leader of a republican country ?
why is google the search engine of choice for you ?
( applause )
there are 2 cmus .
i 'm not here to argue the guilt or innocence of any prisoner .
there 's an estimated 60 to 70 prisoners here , and they 're overwhelmingly muslim .
they 've included people like yassin aref .
`` `` wants a transfer . '' `` told him no . '' ''
and i was approved .
that came as quite a shock .
`` the bureau of prisons describes cmus as `` '' self-contained housing units . '' '' but i think that 's an orwellian way of describing black holes . ''
the opposite is a giver .
then there 's another kind of taker that we wo n't be addressing today , and that 's called a psychopath .
i had engineers measuring their productivity .
( laughter ) and then in sales , too , the lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople .
i want to talk about what it takes to build cultures where givers actually get to succeed .
( laughter ) and that way justice gets served .
but they 're not .
they make up the majority of people who bring in the lowest revenue , but also the highest revenue .
i want to talk about how to do that , not just in businesses , but also in nonprofits , schools — even governments .
are you ready ?
and i learned a great lesson about this from fortune 's best networker .
if you run an organization , we can actually make this easier .
i do n't know what that means — ( laughter ) but i hope you do .
the givers will be generous because they do n't have to worry about the consequences .
( laughter ) we forget about the other two combinations .
disagreeable givers are the most undervalued people in our organizations , because they 're the ones who give the critical feedback that no one wants to hear but everyone needs to hear .
i want to live in a world where givers succeed , and i hope you will help me create that world .
thank you .
first of all , i 'm a geek .
she 's not a high-powered political staffer , nor a lobbyist .
a global citizen is someone who self-identifies first and foremost not as a member of a state , a tribe or a nation , but as a member of the human race , and someone who is prepared to act on that belief , to tackle our world 's greatest challenges .
i want to make the case to you today that the world 's future depends on global citizens .
`` i 'd ask her questions like , `` '' mum , why i ca n't i dress up and play with puppets all day ? '' '' `` why do you want fries with that ? '' ''
`` as a `` '' why '' '' kid , i thought i could change the world , and it was impossible to convince me otherwise . ''
and so i was awarded the chance to go to the philippines to learn more .
but do n't let the romance of that name fool you , because it was nothing more than a rancid landfill that kids like sonny boy spent hours rummaging through every single day to find something , anything of value .
that 's why , a few years later , i joined with a group of college friends in bringing the make poverty history campaign to australia .
but here 's the thing : it did n't last .
we needed to somehow turn that short-term excitement of people involved with the make poverty history campaign into long-term passion .
it had to be part of their identity .
so in 2012 , we cofounded an organization that had exactly that as its goal .
this is about citizens taking action .
it 's often that they do n't know how to take action , or that they believe that their actions will have no effect .
and as we did so , we discovered something really thrilling , that when you make global citizenship your mission , you suddenly find yourself with some extraordinary allies .
see , extreme poverty is n't the only issue that 's fundamentally global .
you had to take action on behalf of a global cause , and only once you 'd done that could you earn enough points to qualify .
i had no interest in citizenship purely as some sort of feel-good thing .
and this is where i believe we can learn a lot from davinia , who started taking action as a global citizen back in 2012 .
see , when thousands of global citizens find inspiration from each other , it 's amazing to see their collective power .
global citizens encouraged by the late-night host stephen colbert launched a twitter invasion on norway .
but despite all of this momentum , we face some huge challenges .
see , you might be thinking to yourself , how can we possibly persuade world leaders to sustain a focus on global issues ?
i experienced this for the first time when i was 21 years old .
i took a meeting with a then-australian foreign minister who shall remain nameless — [ alexander downer ] ( laughter ) and behind closed doors , i shared with him my passion to end extreme poverty .
he said we need to look after our own backyard first .
parochialism offers this false dichotomy because it pits the poor in one country against the poor in another .
the most we could do in those days was fire off a letter and wait for the next election .
today , billions of citizens have more tools , more access to information , more capacity to influence than ever before .
both the problems and the tools to solve them are right before us .
so where are we ?
we have such a long way to go .
but this is the opportunity that i see .
thanks to him and so many others , i came to understand the importance of being part of a movement of people — the kids willing to look up from their screens and out to the world , the global citizens .
and this attracts metals from their local environment .
one of the most pervasive problems in the world today for people is inadequate access to clean drinking water .
but the process is very expensive and it 's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe .
and also , the brine that 's produced is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea .
so i work in singapore at the moment , and this is a place that 's really a leading place for desalination technology .
and singapore proposes by 2060 to produce [ 900 ] million liters per day of desalinated water .
and this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play .
we have a global health challenge in our hands today , and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs is too costly , takes far too long , and it fails more often than it succeeds .
guess what . they do n't .
they do n't like that environment because it 's nothing like what they have in the body .
what about animal testing ?
so if we want to make cells happy outside our bodies , we need to become cell architects .
we have living cells in that little chip , cells that are in a dynamic environment interacting with different cell types .
we 're simply trying to recreate in this tiny chip the smallest functional unit that represents the biochemistry , the function and the mechanical strain that the cells experience in our bodies .
so how does it work ? let me show you .
we use techniques from the computer chip manufacturing industry to make these structures at a scale relevant to both the cells and their environment .
white blood cells are our body 's defense against bacterial invaders , and when they sense this inflammation due to infection , they will enter from the blood into the lung and engulf the bacteria .
it sticks , it wiggles its way through between the cell layers , through the pore , comes out on the other side of the membrane , and right there , it 's going to engulf the bacteria labeled in green .
in that tiny chip , you just witnessed one of the most fundamental responses our body has to an infection .
these structures are called cilia , and they actually move the mucus out of the lung .
but mucus is actually very important .
cilia and the clearance of mucus are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis .
we did n't stop with the lung on a chip .
and we 've put intestinal human cells in a gut on a chip , and they 're under constant peristaltic motion , this trickling flow through the cells , and we can mimic many of the functions that you actually would expect to see in the human intestine .
now , the true power of this technology , however , really comes from the fact that we can fluidically link them .
now we 're really getting excited .
we 're not going to ever recreate a whole human in these chips , but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what 's going to happen in humans .
is it excreted in your kidneys ?
we could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as sars .
you wo n't find many clinical trials in which children are involved , yet every day , we give children medications , and the only safety data we have on that drug is one that we obtained from adults .
they may not respond in the same way adults do .
now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations , put them on chips , and create populations on a chip .
this could really change the way we do clinical trials .
and this is the team and the people that are doing this .
it 's really a convergence of disciplines , where biology is influencing the way we design , the way we engineer , the way we build .
we 're establishing important industry collaborations such as the one we have with a company that has expertise in large-scale digital manufacturing .
this is an instrument that our engineers are actually prototyping right now in the lab , and this instrument is going to give us the engineering controls that we 're going to require in order to link 10 or more organ chips together .
it does something else that 's very important .
`` i myself , a couple of years back , had a really bad headache , just could n't shake it , thought , `` '' well , i 'll try something different . '' '' i took some advil . fifteen minutes later , i was on my way to the emergency room with a full-blown asthma attack . ''
well , we could imagine one day having geraldine on a chip , having danielle on a chip , having you on a chip .
personalized medicine . thank you .
and one of my favorite things was picking names .
well , they delay because they 're afraid .
they 're afraid their baby will die .
how can it be that 2.6 million babies die around the world before they 're even one month old ?
that 's the population of vancouver .
and the shocking thing is : why ?
`` it 's called `` '' precision public health . '' '' for me , precision medicine comes from a very special place . ''
i trained as a cancer doctor , an oncologist .
but too often my treatments made them feel worse .
i still remember young women being driven to my clinic by their moms — adults , who had to be helped into my exam room by their mothers .
and i want everything to change again .
so here 's what 's happening .
it was a terrible time .
all my patients died .
but we know that antiretroviral therapy can virtually guarantee that she will not transmit the virus to the baby .
so what do we do ?
but it 's just not practical .
we can do that because then we 'll know .
and why would we stop there ?
or as a philanthropist that 's now given away serious money ?
i 'm only alive because so long ago , i was helped by generous strangers .
but , sadly , i never bonded with them again .
we pioneered all sorts of new , flexible work methods : job shares , profit-sharing , and eventually , co-ownership when i took a quarter of the company into the hands of the staff at no cost to anyone but me .
so i had to compromise with operational research work , which had the intellectual challenge that interested me and the commercial value that was valued by the clients : things like scheduling freight trains , time-tabling buses , stock control , lots and lots of stock control .
i believe in the beauty of work when we do it properly and in humility .
out of the several , one struck me the most .
the third step was a challenge .
( applause )
today , i want you to look at children who become suicide bombers through a completely different lens .
i spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with taliban recruiters , trying to understand how the taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children were actively signing up to their cause .
young boys are taught justifications for suicide attacks and the execution of spies .
hazrat ali is from a poor farming family in swat .
he joined the taliban a year ago when he was 13 .
then they take us to a madrassa and teach us things from the koran .
they ask us to use them only against the infidels .
soc : i , in my research , have seen that the taliban have perfected the way in which they recruit and train children , and i think it 's a five-step process .
then they ship them off , hundreds of miles away to hard-line schools that run along the taliban agenda .
step three : the taliban want these children to hate the world that they currently live in .
that 's why pakistani civilians , over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone , are fair game .
the taliban are running suicide schools , preparing a generation of boys for atrocities against civilians .
boy : i would love to .
but only if i get permission from my dad .
when i look at suicide bombers younger than me , or my age , i get so inspired by their terrific attacks .
`` boy : on the day of judgment , god will ask me , `` why did you do that ? '' ''
`` i will answer , `` '' my lord ! only to make you happy ! ''
singer : ♫ on the day of judgment ♫ ♫ my god will call me ♫ ♫ my body will be put back together ♫ ♫ and god will ask me why i did this ♫ soc : i leave you all with this thought : if you grew up in these circumstances , faced with these choices , would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious afterlife ?
`` as one taliban recruiter told me , `` there will always be sacrificial lambs in this war . '' ''
thank you .
this is the venue where , as a young man , some of the music that i wrote was first performed .
it was , remarkably , a pretty good sounding room .
with all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good .
the sound system was kind of decent .
so the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
other places around the country had similar rooms .
this is tootsie 's orchid lounge in nashville .
do we all make things with a venue , a context , in mind ?
okay , africa .
and the music there , i would say , the instruments , the intricate rhythms , the way it 's played , the setting , the context , it 's all perfect . it all works perfect .
and it would be a mess in a context like this . this is a gothic cathedral .
`` ( music : `` '' spem in alium '' '' by thomas tallis ) in a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect . ''
it actually improves it .
they 're smaller , even less reverberant , so he can write really frilly music that 's very intricate — and it works .
they used to eat , drink and yell out to people on the stage , just like they do at cbgb 's and places like that .
if they liked an aria , they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore , not at the end of the show , but immediately .
( laughter ) and well , that was an opera experience .
but wagner made an innovation .
he wanted a little more bombast , so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there .
this is carnegie hall .
around the same , according to alex ross who writes for the new yorker , this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet — no more eating , drinking and yelling at the stage , or gossiping with one another during the show .
again , it 's noisy . they 're playing for dancers .
so the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that .
it changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music .
so far , a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music , but singers , like frank sinatra , could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone .
it would have been impossible without recorded music as well .
there 's live music , and there 's recorded music .
and they no longer have to be exactly the same .
and , as with jazz , the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .
`` ( music : `` '' rapper 's delight '' '' by the sugarhill gang ) the mc would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies . ''
musicians who ended up there did the best they could .
they wrote what is now called arena rock , which is medium-speed ballads .
the tempos are medium . it sounds big .
and in some ways , the music that they 're writing for this place works perfectly .
i grew up with a radio in a car .
`` ( music : `` '' who u wit '' '' by lil ' jon & the east side boyz ) the music that , i would say , is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it . ''
it might not be what you want to listen to at home , but it works great in the car — has a huge frequency spectrum , you know , big bass and high-end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle .
well , according to david attenborough and some other people , birds do it too — that the birds in the canopy , where the foliage is dense , their calls tend to be high-pitched , short and repetitive .
and birds like this savannah sparrow , they tend to have a buzzing ( sound clip : savannah sparrow song ) type call .
other birds , like this tanager , have adapted within the same species .
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , primarily the form at least , to fit these contexts , and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit existing operating systems , is that how it works ?
yeah . i think it 's evolutionary .
it 's adaptive .
the romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something .
i 'm saying the two , the passion , the joy , are not mutually exclusive .
and like the birds , the joy is still there , even though we have changed what we do to fit the context .
( applause ) i tell you all of this because the events of that night changed the course of my life to some degree .
psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins , and it results in a personality that 's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial and sometimes very violent behavior .
but remember that my main interest is not understanding why people do n't care about others .
as my research has now shown , all three things are true .
they are better at recognizing other people 's fear .
they 're literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress .
`` they say , `` '' nothing . ''
they have no center .
`` your study here is going to find out that i 'm just the same as you . '' '' i think the best description for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility , which is that quality that in the words of st. augustine makes men as angels . ''
and i think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person .
so what 's at the root of all these amazing changes ?
as societies become wealthier and better off , people seem to turn their focus of attention outward , and as a result , all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases , from volunteering to charitable donations and even altruistic kidney donations .
and i do n't know exactly why this is , but i think it may be that we now just know so much more about the suffering of strangers in distant places , and so we now care a lot more about the suffering of those distant strangers .
thank you .
those trying to employ them think they do n't know enough .
and teachers are also frustrated .
so at one end we 've got falling interest in education in math , and at the other end we 've got a more mathematical world , a more quantitative world than we ever have had .
i believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work .
it 's done by geologists , engineers , biologists , all sorts of different people — modeling and simulation .
over the years we 've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically . it 's part of human society .
what is math ?
now here 's the crazy thing right now .
math is a much broader subject than calculating .
it 's the thing you 'd like to avoid if you can , like to get a machine to do .
i still do a lot of that , mainly for estimating .
and then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating , but i think they 're relatively small in number .
that 's absolutely the right thing , for people to follow their self-interest .
so i have this distinction between what we 're making people do and the subject that 's sort of mainstream and the subject that , in a sense , people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that .
are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill ?
it can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that .
and what 's worse , what they 're learning there is n't even practically useful anymore .
just to be clear , i think computers can really help with this problem , actually make it more conceptual .
now , of course , like any great tool , they can be used completely mindlessly , like turning everything into a multimedia show , like the example i was shown of solving an equation by hand , where the computer was the teacher — show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand .
see , normally in school , you do things like solve quadratic equations .
same principles applied — calculations , harder .
and problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this .
they 're not just simple , dumbed-down things that we see in school math .
and think of the outside world .
if you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it .
i ca n't think of any other subject where that 's recently been possible .
and experience of harder problems — being able to play with the math , interact with it , feel it .
traditionally it 's been by how difficult it is to calculate , but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts , however hard the calculating .
this was an example i built for my daughter .
that 's a view of the world that we do n't usually give people for many , many years after this .
and you see , this is n't some dumbed-down model here .
we have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward , and also our societies , based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics .
( applause )
they were n't as sophisticated as those used by the americans and the british .
and people did communicate .
but they are n't a commercial enterprise .
these procedures are declared to be secret military operations .
i would walk straight into door frames .
other times i would n't be able to speak or move at all .
the symptoms were real , he said , but they had no biological cause .
i walked back the two miles from my neurologist 's office to my house , my legs wrapped in this strange , almost electric kind of pain .
i was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis .
if my husband goes for a run , he might be sore for a couple of days .
why has this idea had such staying power ?
this issue is much bigger than just my disease .
multiple sclerosis could be misdiagnosed as hysterical paralysis until the cat scan and the mri discovered brain lesions .
what also gives me hope is the resilience of patients .
we have filled the void with something wonderful , but it is not enough .
but i am so grateful for how far i have come .
i remember what it was like when i was stuck in that bedroom , when it had been months since i had seen the sun .
we need to think in more nuanced ways about women 's health .
so the best way of explaining it is to just show it .
and what 's great about this is the technology 's actually allowing the phone to start to see and understand much like how the human brain does .
and here is this morning 's newspaper , and we have some wimbledon news , which is great .
so what i have here is a wireless router .
my american colleagues have told me i 've got to call it a router , so that everyone here understands — ( laughter ) — but nonetheless , here is the device .
( laughter ) mm : awesome . thank you .
( applause ) the incredible work that made that possible was done here in the u.k. by scientists at cambridge , and they work in our offices , and i 've got a lovely picture of them here .
so we have teachers who 've tagged up textbooks , teachers who 've tagged up school classrooms , and a great example of this is a school in the u.k .
( laughter ) mm : ( laughs ) so , it 's not magic .
it 's completely free to download this application .
mm : well done . we 've been aurasma . thank you .
the problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that archie does n't really understand .
and he 's operating in a hostile environment .
on one particular occasion , one of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners ' lavatory while it was full of prisoners .
so the situation seemed pretty desperate .
he 'd already smuggled vitamin c into the camp , and now he managed to get hold of supplies of marmite on the black market .
and importantly , it 's a rich source of vitamin b12 .
he very carefully and meticulously notes his results in an exercise book .
i 'm not even telling you the story because i think we should be running more carefully controlled randomized trials in all aspects of public policy , although i think that would also be completely awesome .
well let me give you an example .
you know hans : the mick jagger of ted .
i mean , have a look at this graph .
this is produced by the physicist cesar hidalgo .
imagine you had one second per product category .
there are 100,000 there . it would take you all day .
i 'm not trying to solve the middle east problem .
`` we tend to retreat and say , `` '' we can draw a picture , we can post some graphs , we get it , we understand how this works . '' '' and we do n't . ''
this baby was produced through trial and error .
over millions of years , variation and selection , variation and selection — trial and error , trial and error .
how do you do it ?
you create a spray of detergent .
then the spray dries . it turns into powder .
you find yourself a mathematician ; you find yourself a physicist — somebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid .
even this problem , too complicated .
you take a nozzle and you create 10 random variations on the nozzle .
you try out all 10 ; you keep the one that works best .
you try out all 10. you keep the one that works best .
you see how this works , right ?
it looks a bit like a chess piece — functions absolutely brilliantly .
and the moment you step back from the god complex — let 's just try to have a bunch of stuff ; let 's have a systematic way of determining what 's working and what 's not — you can solve your problem .
the u.s. economy is still the world 's greatest economy .
it 's far higher than the failure rate of , say , americans .
i sometimes wonder .
i have no idea how to do it .
i have half a dozen ideas .
then we 'll test some other ideas out .
all the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down .
they knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients , and they knew it was very unethical to run any kind of trial or experiment .
nevertheless , archie managed to get permission to do this .
he ran his trial .
you 're killing people with your clinical trials . you need to shut it down now .
`` and then he says , `` '' well that 's very interesting , gentlemen , because when i gave you the table of results , i swapped the two columns around . ''
it is n't easy .
it 's incredibly painful .
and since i started talking about this subject and researching this subject , i 've been really haunted by something a japanese mathematician said on the subject .
it turned out to be absolutely instrumental many decades later in proving fermat 's last theorem .
but it was always a conjecture .
taniyama tried and tried and tried and he could never prove that it was true .
his friend , goro shimura — who worked on the mathematics with him — many decades later , reflected on taniyama 's life .
he made a lot of mistakes .
but he made mistakes in a good direction .
six years ago , i started writing about women entrepreneurs during and after conflict .
i set out to write a compelling economic story , one that had great characters , that no one else was telling , and one that i thought mattered .
but they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent .
rwanda in the immediate aftermath of the genocide was 77 percent female .
i want to introduce you to some of those entrepreneurs i 've met and share with you some of what they 've taught me over the years .
because long after this round of internationals left , business would help keep her country peaceful and secure .
so i was amazed .
`` why are you so passionate ? '' '' she said , `` '' oh gayle , this is actually my third business . ''
and that was actually an excellent business , because we provided jobs for women all around our neighborhood .
`` i went on to bosnia , and early on in my interviews i met with an imf official who said , `` '' you know , gayle , i do n't think we actually have women in business in bosnia , but there is a lady selling cheese nearby on the side of the road . ''
and she was just the start .
`` if you see the word `` '' microfinance , '' '' what comes to mind ? ''
why is that ?
microfinance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-sufficiency and self-respect , but we must move beyond micro-hopes and micro-ambitions for women , because they have so much greater hopes for themselves .
nearly everywhere i go , i meet incredibly interesting entrepreneurs who are seeking access to finance , access to markets and established business networks .
those in small businesses ca n't get the capital they need to expand and those in microbusiness ca n't grow out of them .
and she had come to washington , not seeking a handout and not seeking a microloan .
and kiva.org , the microlender , is actually now experimenting with crowdsourcing small and medium sized loans .
and that 's just to start .
you know why ?
because — and i say this as somebody who worked in finance — 500 billion dollars at least has gone into the emerging markets in the past decade .
so you see , this is not about doing good , this is about global growth and global employment .
and women can no longer be both half the population and a special interest group .
and finally , there is no society anywhere in all the world that is not changed except by its most exceptional .
`` and when i complained to my grandmother , a world war ii veteran who worked in film for 50 years and who supported me from the age of 13 , that i was terrified that if i turned down a plum assignment at abc for a fellowship overseas , i would never ever , ever find another job , she said , `` '' kiddo , i 'm going to tell you two things . ''
we are the majority .
thank you very much .
( applause )
it 's not that long ago , 17 years , and here we are now .
( applause )
so just bear with me . we 'll go real fast , you know ?
they live in the emerging megacities of the developing world .
and it 's all about this question , in a very artistic and indirect kind of way .
well , very quickly , you get a bright green future for the developing world .
this is a merry-go-round invented by the company roundabout , which pumps water as kids play . you know ?
this is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere .
it 's all grounded in the tenets of biology .
and lo and behold , look what happened .
how many of them showed up for him ?
my father has just built the best outhouse in our little village in ukraine .
inside , it 's a smelly , gaping hole in the ground , but outside , it 's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun .
this makes me feel so proud , so important , that i appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and i devise missions for us .
so we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs and we set them free .
i am six years old , and i do n't cry when we leave home and we come to america , because i expect it to be a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and bazooka bubble gum , bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside , bazooka that we 'd get once a year in ukraine and we 'd have to chew one piece for an entire week .
only , we do n't know that it 's a homeless shelter .
we think that it 's a hotel , a hotel with lots of rats .
and in that moment , i feel like a millionaire .
and one time , when he finally got his box of frosted flakes back , it was crawling with roaches .
i 'm going to tell you about one more formerly homeless member of our family .
we forget about all of our new middle-class frustrations and disappointments , and we feel like millionaires .
they have been expanding , urbanization has been expanding , at an exponential rate in the last 200 years so that by the second part of this century , the planet will be completely dominated by cities .
here 's some numbers .
it 's now more than 82 percent .
china 's building 300 new cities in the next 20 years .
however , cities , despite having this negative aspect to them , are also the solution .
and so there 's an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities .
this work has been done with an extraordinary group of people , and they 've done all the work , and i 'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together .
the 10 billion people on the planet in 2050 want to live in places like this , having things like this , doing things like this , with economies that are growing like this , not realizing that entropy produces things like this , this , this and this .
that 's the quest .
so here 's two questions that i have in my head when i think about this problem .
the first is : are cities part of biology ?
is edinburgh a horse ?
and if that is the case , how come that it 's very hard to kill a city ?
you could drop an atom bomb on a city , and 30 years later it 's surviving .
we have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions .
the same principles , the same dynamics , the same organization is at work in all of these , including us , and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size .
here 's how you grew .
we 're all pretty much the same .
what is plotted here is metabolic rate — how much energy you need per day to stay alive — versus your weight , your mass , for all of us bunch of organisms .
and it 's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10 , otherwise you could n't get everything on the graph .
and here 's the point of that .
there is an extraordinary regularity .
so you tell me the size of a mammal , i can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology , life history , etc .
heart rates are slower ; you live longer ; diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower , etc .
this shows that in this very simple example , which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size — plotted in the same way as the biology — you see exactly the same kind of thing .
that is that the number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size .
it scales in the same way everywhere .
and any infrastructure you look at — whether it 's the length of roads , length of electrical lines — anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way .
but even more surprising is if you look at socio-economic quantities , quantities that have no analog in biology , that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to 10,000 years ago .
and here 's the statement .
what is the reason for this ?
well i do n't have time to tell you about all the mathematics , but underlying this is the social networks , because this is a universal phenomenon .
always , all the data shows it 's the same , despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently .
economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior .
but it has a terrible catch , and the catch is that this system is destined to collapse .
and it 's destined to collapse for many reasons — kind of malthusian reasons — that you run out of resources .
and the question is : can we , as socio-economic beings , avoid a heart attack ?
see companies , they scale .
we could use sales , anything you like .
( applause )
they must have done better , in terms of economic growth .
blah blah blah , blah .
so what the hell was that ?
well , you do n't know because you could n't understand it .
`` there is no other typographic information or visual information on the front , and the name of the book is `` '' only what 's necessary . '' '' so this is sort of symbolic about the decisions i have to make every day about the design that i 'm perceiving , and the design i 'm creating . ''
`` we ask ourselves this . [ `` '' when should you be clear ? '' '' ] now , something like this , whether we can read it or not , needs to be really , really clear . ''
tsukuru tazaki , his name does not correspond to a color , so his nickname is colorless , and as he 's looking back on their friendship , he recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand .
he catches up with each of these people to find out why they treated him the way they did .
what does this mean ?
`` this is an approach i wanted to take to a book of essays by david sedaris that had this title at the time . [ `` '' all the beauty you will ever need '' '' ] now , the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing . ''
and so i wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself and then somehow show a reader reacting to it .
this led me to graffiti .
i think anybody who lives in an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time , and there 's all different sorts of it .
`` now whether you look at this and think , `` '' oh , that 's a charming urban affectation , '' '' or you look at it and say , `` '' that 's illegal abuse of property , '' '' the one thing i think we can all agree on is that you can not read it . ''
so i was thinking , how do we apply this to this book ?
and it 's a story about a japanese-american detective in los angeles in 1941 investigating a murder .
and so we finally ended up making it .
we used it at loyola on the chapel , and it did n't work .
this is for michael eisner — disney .
if any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
you 've got to date around .
there was this guy steve , the i.t . guy .
i am totally down with splitting the bill .
there were just bad for me .
so i said fine , i 've got a new plan .
i found smileygirl1978 .
so i did n't reach out to any woman first .
he made a lot of really interesting cultural references .
it 's just not the ones that we 're being presented with online .
simple as that , right ? no biggie .
i 'm going to do what philosophers do .
there were just little artfully placed blobs of paint .
can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?
now , if you think you see some pale yellow — i 'll run this a few more times .
i want you to see a few that are particularly striking .
this one because it 's so large and yet it 's pretty hard to see .
how many engines on the wing of that boeing ?
i was born to a family where education was pervasive .
unfortunately , most of the people in the world are not so lucky .
in some parts of the world , for example , south africa , education is just not readily accessible .
in south africa , the educational system was constructed in the days of apartheid for the white minority .
let 's talk about what 's suddenly possible .
it 's a machine learning class , and it has 400 people enrolled every time it 's offered .
( video ) robert ghrist : welcome to calculus .
we get unbelievable segregation .
nick parlante : for each pixel in the image , set the red to zero .
dan jurafsky : does lufthansa serve breakfast and san jose ? well , that sounds funny .
or ryan , who ca n't go to school , because his immune deficient daughter ca n't be risked to have germs come into the house , so he could n't leave the house .
so what made these courses so different ?
after all , online course content has been available for a while .
so this format allows us to break away from the one-size-fits-all model of education , and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum .
and of course these simple retrieval questions are not the end of the story .
one needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions , and one also needs to provide the students with feedback on those questions .
now , how do you grade the work of 100,000 students if you do not have 10,000 tas ?
now , fortunately , technology has come a long way , and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework .
so we tried to convince , for example , some of our humanities faculty that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy .
first of all , there was a question and answer forum , where students would pose questions , and other students would answer those questions .
and the really amazing thing is , because there were so many students , it means that even if a student posed a question at 3 o'clock in the morning , somewhere around the world , there would be somebody who was awake and working on the same problem .
students also self-assembled , without any kind of intervention from us , into small study groups .
and in the context of particular courses , you can ask questions like , what are some of the misconceptions that are more common and how do we help students fix them ?
each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer .
so how do we do that ?
second , it would enable lifelong learning .
( applause )
thank you .
and they were shocked to find out that for every 100 working age adults in the country , 47 of them lacked level 1 numeracy skills .
`` but i preferred , actually , the reaction of a schoolchild when i presented at a school this information , who raised their hand and said , `` '' how do we know that the person who made that number is n't one of the 49 percent either ? '' '' ( laughter ) so clearly , there 's a numeracy issue , because these are important skills for life , and a lot of the changes that we want to introduce in this century involve us becoming more comfortable with numbers . ''
now , as useful as studies like these are , i think we risk herding people inadvertently into one of two categories ; that there are two kinds of people : those people that are comfortable with numbers , that can do numbers , and the people who ca n't .
and what i 'm trying to talk about here today is to say that i believe that is a false dichotomy .
i think you do n't have to have tremendously high levels of numeracy to be inspired by numbers , and that should be the starting point to the journey ahead .
if you look at the etymology of the word statistics , it 's the science of dealing with data about the state or the community that we live in .
so statistics are about us as a group , not us as individuals .
and statistics in this way are at their most powerful when they surprise us .
so there 's this big variation between what we think , our perception , and the reality as given by statistics .
and i think that 's interesting .
and rather like numeracy , this is not just an english problem .
that 's what they thought .
so extraordinary variations , and surprising to some , but not surprising to people who have read the work of daniel kahneman , for example , the nobel-winning economist .
and there are many reasons for this .
kahneman had a nice way of referring to that .
and that has enormous repercussions for decision making .
and the numbers are there , but they sit in the background .
how about the next question ?
it turns out , the reaction was , um ...
was more than i could have hoped for .
he got 44 for his own area .
my husband and i used to run an architecture studio in the old town main square .
half of the city 's other neighborhoods are now rubble .
the economy is completely broken , and people are still fighting .
they blew up city streets and relocated monuments .
but over time , the ancient became worthless , and the new , coveted .
as the shape of the built environment changed , so the lifestyles and sense of belonging of the communities also started changing .
when i read about heterogeneous urbanism in other parts of the world , involving ethnic neighborhoods in british cities or around paris or brussels , i recognize the beginning of the kind of instability we have witnessed so disastrously here in syria .
what are the principles that we should adopt in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes ?
there is a neighborhood here in homs that 's called baba amr that has been fully destroyed .
almost two years ago , i introduced this design into a un-habitat competition for rebuilding it .
and so , this makes this coming century a challenge .
but if you come about it from a different perspective , you can create some more interesting , more novel concepts .
so we built something .
pay attention to not only how fun this thing is , but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like san francisco .
it 's really maneuverable . you have a hand-held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceleration , braking , go in reverse if you like , also have braking .
so i 'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles .
this uses 20 times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car , which means not only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build , but it also reduces the footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation .
so instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city , now you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation .
then growth gets better and better .
this part , for example .
they help educate our immune system .
so when we take them together , they look like this .
so you probably heard that we 're pretty much all the same in terms of our human dna .
you 're 99.99 percent identical in terms of your human dna to the person sitting next to you .
and so how much do they outnumber us ?
is it our cells ?
now , you might think , well , we 're human because of our dna , but it turns out that each of us has about 20,000 human genes , depending on what you count exactly , but as many as two million to 20 million microbial genes .
( laughter ) so where do our microbes come from in the first place ?
well if , as i do , you have dogs or kids , you probably have some dark suspicions about that , all of which are true , by the way .
and what 's more , we 're starting to do clinical trials with more children to figure out whether this has a protective effect generally .
so i 'm just going to start this going and we 'll see how that happens .
so why might we want to do this ?
this is one of the newest things we 've been able to visualize with colleagues at the university of minnesota .
so here 's that map of the human microbiome again .
what we 're looking at now — i 'm going to add in the community of some people with c. diff .
he was saving lives with this machine .
with that guy 's data ?
that 's as ambitious as we are .
ab : 1824 , ok .
oh , i did this row already .
now , let me recap .
so allow me to tell you about it .
and he wanted one so badly .
in the commercials , and on the boxes for the easy-bake ovens , hasbro marketed them specifically to girls .
change.org is an online petition-sharing platform where you can create a petition and share it across all of these social media networks , through facebook , through twitter , through youtube , through reddit , through tumblr , through whatever you can think of .
and so i created a petition along with the youtube video that i added to the petition basically asking hasbro to change the way that they marketed it , in featuring boys in the commercials , on the boxes , and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors .
i was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets , and it was amazing .
in three weeks , maybe three and a half , i had 46,000 signatures on this petition .
people online , and sometimes even in real life , were disrespectful to me and my family , and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time , and it really discouraged me .
`` from user name liquidsore29 — interesting user names we have here— `` disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay . '' ''
`` from jeffrey gutierrez : `` omg , shut up . you just want money and attention . '' ''
haters gon na hate .
it would stop , and then start , and then stop , and then start .
and i said , that 's what this is ; this is calcium carbonate .
i 'm going to try to go through 12 , really quickly .
back to that shell : the shell is a self-assembling material .
and really , that 's what other organisms do as well .
( applause )
i 'd like you to come back with me for a moment to the 19th century , specifically to june 24 , 1833 .
the members of the association are shocked to realize that it 's the poet samuel taylor coleridge , who had n't even left his house in years until that day .
a young cambridge scholar named william whewell stood up and quieted the audience .
after this , they were scientists , professionals with a particular scientific method , goals , societies and funding .
and whewell not only coined the term scientist , as well as the words anode , cathode and ion , but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides .
they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
they felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century .
now that 's a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws , which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise .
`` reading one of herschel 's books was such a watershed moment for charles darwin that he would later say , `` '' scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me . ''
`` it made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge . '' '' it also shaped darwin 's scientific method , as well as that used by his peers . ''
harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains .
whewell 's worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters ' knowledge to all ship captains .
these tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part-time workers known as — and this is amazing — computers , but these calculations were really difficult .
each month required 1,365 calculations , so these tables were filled with mistakes .
it had a separate memory and central processor .
it was capable of iteration , conditional branching and parallel processing , and it was programmable using punched cards , an idea babbage took from jacquard 's loom .
`` and `` '' what proportion of the earth is covered in water ? '' '' once scientists became members of a professional group , they were slowly walled off from the rest of us . ''
this is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends .
thank you .
( applause )
this is where it began .
and the situation is that a car full of paramedics on their way home from the hospital after work have run across the wreckage , and they 've advised the police that there were no survivors inside the car , that the driver 's dead , that i 'm dead .
and the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive to cut apart the vehicle to extract the body of the driver .
and when they do , they find that behind the glass , they find me .
the show began with tremendous special effects , because there were catastrophic climate shifts — which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today .
so we actually grew our consciousness in response to this global threat .
and then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle .
so watching all of this show from outer space , you think we get it , we understand that the most precious resource on the blue planet is our consciousness .
but we do n't . we take our consciousness for granted .
until it was stripped from me , i never thought about it .
these are just some examples .
that statistic is so sad .
there is no more drastic and sudden gap created between potential and actual mind than a severe head injury .
we find that the number two source of disability is depression in the age group of 15 to 44 .
the average teenager sends 3,300 texts every [ month ] .
we 're talking about a society that is retreating into depression and disassociation when we are potentially confronting the next great catastrophic climate shift .
so what you 'd be wondering , watching the human show , is are we going to confront and address the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way by growing our consciousness , or are we going to continue to retreat ?
and that then might lead you to watch an episode one day of cedars-sinai medical center and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind .
the horseshoe shape you can see on my skull is where they operated and went inside my brain to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life .
but if you look into the eye of consciousness , that single eye you can see , i 'm looking down , but let me tell you how i felt at that point .
i did n't feel empty ; i felt everything simultaneously .
so from this experience of my recovery , i want to share four particular aspects — i call them the four c 's of consciousness — that helped me grow my potential mind back towards the actual mind that i work with every day .
plasticity means that there was always hope for our reason — hope for our ability to rebuild that function .
let 's just talk about full-scale i.q .
i wo n't go into the intrascatter that 's in the subtests , but they still had a neurologic issue .
but that person could be identified as having a learning disability .
the craniomandibular system is critical to that .
he then held my jaw in the right position while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment .
if that sounds like a very , very strange thing to say and rather a bold statement — how can the jaw affect the entire body ? — let me simply point out to you , if i ask you tomorrow to put one grain of sand between your teeth and go for a nice long walk , how far would you last before you had to remove that grain of sand ?
now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth and see the difference it makes .
the next issue that resolved was that , if 90 percent of head and neck pain is caused by imbalance , the other 10 percent , largely — if you set aside aneurysms , brain cancer and hormonal issues — is the circulation .
imagine the blood flowing through your body — i was told at ucla medical center — as one sealed system .
if that some place else where it bulges is inside the biggest nerve in your body , your brain , you get a vascular migraine .
communication , the next c. this is critical .
and i 'm just going to give you an example today of movement to the paralyzed .
so two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime .
five of them would still weigh less than a rupee coin .
where does it go inside the body ?
the concept that they 're working towards — and they have working prototypes — is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body where they 're needed .
and other fm devices implanted in fingertips , on contacting a surface , will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain , so that the person feels a sense of touch .
and when i came out of my coma , i recognized my family , but i did n't remember my own past .
and as i discovered these threats to consciousness and how they are surrounding the world and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day , i discovered what truly remained .
i do n't know what i had in my mind .
i did n't expect that person that i was going to meet to be him .
and we have his book outside in the bookshop .
i must tell you , they 're an amazing — there 's a hundred people who work in that building — engineers , scientists , and other team members — all the time .
alfred mann has set up this foundation to advance this research because he saw there 's no way venture capital would come in for something like this .
now , part of the reason for this is that we 've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents .
we 're not ready for the next epidemic .
i followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we use to track polio eradication .
and as you look at what went on , the problem was n't that there was a system that did n't work well enough , the problem was that we did n't have a system at all .
the case reports came in on paper .
as an example , we could have taken the blood of survivors , processed it , and put that plasma back in people to protect them .
but that was never tried .
so there was a lot that was missing .
there 's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go , they move in , they save the day , but that 's just pure hollywood .
the first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers .
and by the time you 're contagious , most people are so sick that they 're bedridden .
so here 's what would happen : it would spread throughout the world very , very quickly .
but in fact , we can build a really good response system .
and we need preparedness .
the best lessons , i think , on how to get prepared are again , what we do for war .
nato has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly .
do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies ?
first , we need strong health systems in poor countries .
that 's where mothers can give birth safely , kids can get all their vaccines .
taking advantage of the military 's ability to move fast , do logistics and secure areas .
so far the score is germs : 1 , people : 0 .
finally , we need lots of advanced r & d in areas of vaccines and diagnostics .
so i think this should absolutely be a priority .
you have no limitations , basically .
so is everything lost ? well , maybe not .
this is good news for life .
what are the signatures of life ?
life is everywhere , absolutely everywhere .
yeah , there are organics at the surface of mars .
i 've worked in broadcast .
and when we went , i was really terrified .
they were lying on the floor laughing .
you could be stamping on somebody , it 's having the same effect .
nietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh .
if you look at when they laugh , they 're laughing with their friends .
so i 've been looking at this in more detail .
interestingly , you see something quite similar with chimpanzees .
actually , it 's not , it 's actually an important social cue .
video starts .
we 're going to be okay .
it gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day .
yes , 11 .
i was treated the same , the same was expected of me .
when i was 15 in 2005 , i completed high school and i moved from canada — saskatoon — to zawiya , my parents ' hometown in libya , a very traditional city .
mind you , i had only ever been to libya before on vacation , and as a seven-year-old girl , it was magic .
it was ice cream and trips to the beach and really excited relatives .
we would n't be here if it were n't for her .
and i wanted and needed for that change to be permanent .
it turns out , it does a little , but not a lot .
i decided to use their defense as my offense , and i began to cite and highlight islamic scripture as well .
so really , the united nations just copied us .
liberals will say you 're using religion and call you a bad conservative .
we have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights , the principles of our faith , not for us , not for the women in your families , not for the women in this room , not even for the women out there , but for societies that would be transformed with the participation of women .
and the only way we can do that , our only option , is to be , and remain , at the table .
do you understand what i 'm saying to you ?
therefore you will do well to act on the side , no matter how far into the laboratory you may go , to serve as teachers during the span of your career .
many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi-literate .
the boy is petting the elephant .
we send people to the moon , we make phones that talk to us or customize radio stations that can play only music we like .
yes , we have prototyped cars that can drive by themselves , but without smart vision , they can not really tell the difference between a crumpled paper bag on the road , which can be run over , and a rock that size , which should be avoided .
we have made fabulous megapixel cameras , but we have not delivered sight to the blind .
photos and videos are becoming an integral part of global life .
in fact , it took mother nature 540 million years of hard work to do this task , and much of that effort went into developing the visual processing apparatus of our brains , not the eyes themselves .
but what about this cat ?
but what if cats are hidden ?
what about these silly cats ?
so about eight years ago , a very simple and profound observation changed my thinking .
if you consider a child 's eyes as a pair of biological cameras , they take one picture about every 200 milliseconds , the average time an eye movement is made .
that 's a lot of training examples .
so instead of focusing solely on better and better algorithms , my insight was to give the algorithms the kind of training data that a child was given through experiences in both quantity and quality .
so we carried on .
we were thrilled to have put together imagenet , and we wanted the whole research world to benefit from it , so in the ted fashion , we opened up the entire data set to the worldwide research community for free .
it takes input from other nodes and sends output to others .
powered by the massive data from imagenet and the modern cpus and gpus to train such a humongous model , the convolutional neural network blossomed in a way that no one expected .
this is like a small child learning to utter a few nouns .
a large airplane sitting on top of an airport runway .
( video ) computer : a cat lying on a bed in a blanket .
this is my son leo .
for the first time , human eyes wo n't be the only ones pondering and exploring our world .
and technology has set us free — this is free wifi .
last september of 2011 , i started an online magazine for teenage girls called rookiemag.com .
so i think the question of what makes a strong female character often goes misinterpreted , and instead we get these two-dimensional superwomen who maybe have one quality that 's played up a lot , like a catwoman type , or she plays her sexuality up a lot , and it 's seen as power .
what makes a strong female character is a character who has weaknesses , who has flaws , who is maybe not immediately likable , but eventually relatable .
became easier once i understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion , a conversation , a process , and this is a spread from a zine that i made last year when i — i mean , i think i 've let myself go a bit on the illustration front since .
but , yeah .
so i said on my blog that i wanted to start this publication for teenage girls and ask people to submit their writing , their photography , whatever , to be a member of our staff .
and this is an excerpt from my first editor 's letter , where i say that rookie , we do n't have all the answers , we 're still figuring it out too , but the point is not to give girls the answers , and not even give them permission to find the answers themselves , but hopefully inspire them to understand that they can give themselves that permission , they can ask their own questions , find their own answers , all of that , and rookie , i think we 've been trying to make it a nice place for all of that to be figured out .
ha ha . ( laughter ) if you use that , you can get away with anything .
so all of that being said , i still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site , that are n't just about being totally powerful , maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those .
now we 've got momentum . this is the tipping point .
what i want to show you next is a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory , where this robot was able to go for longer distances .
because it 's big , it 's heavy .
these are going at a relative speed of two meters per second , and this illustrates the basic principle .
so why work with swarms ?
armed with information like this , we can do several things .
so what is the blockchain ?
this record is replicated on every computer that uses the network .
it 's not an app .
i think it 's closest in description to something like wikipedia .
so let 's take the first example , not knowing who we 're dealing with .
having this kind of portable identity around the physical world and the digital world means we can do all kinds of human trade in a totally new way .
it means for consumers , we can have a lot more transparency .
blockchains allow us to write code , binding contracts , between individuals and then guarantee that those contracts will bear out without a third party enforcer .
blockchains give us the technological capability of creating a record of human exchange , of exchange of currency , of all kinds of digital and physical assets , even of our own personal attributes , in a totally new way .
so in some ways , they become a technological institution that has a lot of the benefits of the traditional institutions we 're used to using in society , but it does this in a decentralized way .
bettina warburg : i think that 's a really good question .
bw : thanks .
the underground railroad was a brilliant hack .
they can actually build government .
and these motions carry a lot of significance , but they 're usually too subtle for us to see , so instead , we have to observe them through direct contact , through touch .
and if we used the same software on the right video , it lets us see each breath that this infant takes , and we can use this as a contact-free way to monitor her breathing .
but sound causes all objects to vibrate .
( audio ) mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow , and everywhere that mary went , that lamb was sure to go .
and that 's something that video still wo n't let us do , at least not traditionally .
so there 's nothing special about this camera .
back in the day , he made custom-made shoes .
but all of that is about to change with 3d printing , and it all started with this , the very first part that was ever printed .
how many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or the distance between your temples ?
good for g.e. , right ?
and their customers and the environment .
what if we could , for the first time , make incredible delectables like this beautiful ted teddy here , that are edible ?
with 3d printing , complexity is free .
i think it 's the wrong question to ask .
now , these are not my grandfather 's shoes .
a polar bear swimming in the arctic , by paul nicklen .
how could i come from a nation ?
how can a human being come from a concept ?
my parents came from countries that did n't exist when they were born .
`` `` '' all experience is local , '' '' he said . ''
`` `` '' i 'm not a national , '' '' i proclaimed onstage . ''
my experience is where i 'm from .
so , where are you a local ?
the first time i went to delhi or to southern parts of italy , i was shocked by how at home i felt .
i 'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from malawi , eileen piri .
i 'll marry when i want .
on the other side , there is this girl .
it was very hard , but we pushed .
now , in malawi , 18 is the legal marriage age , from 15 to 18 .
we can do more .
male advocates , they have to jump in , to step in and work together .
it 's a collective work .
i 'd like to take you on the epic quest of the rosetta spacecraft .
in the center of this cloud , our sun formed and ignited .
in the sky , they look like this .
from the results of that mission , it became immediately clear that comets were ideal bodies to study to understand our solar system .
normally , you look at the sky and you know where you point and where you are .
we recognized features — boulders , craters — and that 's how we know where we are respective to the comet .
here you see in white the trajectory , and the way this works .
on the way there , we flew by earth and we took a few pictures to test our cameras .
for that , we flew special trajectories starting in august .
this whole process we had to do , to go from the mapping of the comet to actually finding the final landing site , was 60 days .
this is a comet day .
two dust particles : the right one they call boris , and they shot it with tantalum in order to be able to analyze it .
we do n't know , so there is a lot to investigate .
on the left-hand side , you see in the middle a pit .
you see it on the right-hand side .
then , at the top , there is a before and an after image of the landing .
the only problem with the after image is , there is no lander .
now , we forgot , but the lander knew .
the blue area here is where we know it must be .
then , finally , the landing day .
for a month and a half , i could n't think about landing day without crying , and i still have the emotion in me .
did you sup on others ' squalor ?
please raise your hand — oh , that 's a lot .

but i also met aluminum mold makers , ammunition producers and all kinds of people .
( laughter ) in total , they weigh 103.7 kilograms .
then , at breakfast , the pig that i followed , the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig were used as an improver of dough .
`` ( laughter ) well , that 's what the producer says : it 's `` '' improving the dough , of course . '' '' in low-fat butter , or actually in many low-fat products , when you take the fat out , you actually take the taste and the texture out . ''
it 's used in paint for the texture , but also for the glossiness .
so , this is sold as cow , but what happens when you slaughter a cow — at least in industrial factory farming — they have all these little bits of steak left that they ca n't actually sell as steak , so what they do is they glue them all together with fibrin from pig blood into this really large sausage , then freeze the sausage , cut it in little slices and sell those as steak again .
in the brewing process , there 's lots of cloudy elements in the beer , so to get rid of these cloudy elements , what some companies do is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve in order to get rid of that cloudiness .
injectable collagen — or , since the '70s , collagen from pigs — has been used for injecting into wrinkles .
well , this must be the strangest thing i found .
this is a bullet coming from a very large ammunition company in the united states .
and while i was making the book , i contacted all the producers of products because i wanted them to send me the real samples and the real specimens .
( laughter ) so , the most beautiful thing i found — at least what i think is the most beautiful — in the book , is this heart valve .
in total , i found 185 products .
thank you very much .
( applause )
and this has certainly been my experience as a traveler .
we feel much the same way about other conflicts around the world .
but if that 's such an easy choice , why do n't more groups use it ?
and as you can probably tell at this point , they win at the end .
i 've been talking a lot about my experiences in the middle east , and some of you might be thinking now that the solution then is for us to educate muslim and arab societies to be more inclusive of their women .
they do not need this kind of help .
women have been part of the most influential movements coming out of the middle east , but they tend to be invisible to the international community .
our cameras are largely focused on the men who often end up involved in the more confrontational scenes that we find so irresistible in our news cycle .
this period , though , was also marked by widespread nonviolent organizing in the forms of strikes , sit-ins and the creation of parallel institutions .
they did this through networks of popular committees , and their use of direct action and communal self-help projects challenged israel 's very ability to continue ruling the west bank and gaza .
according to the israeli army itself , 97 percent of activities during the first intifada were unarmed .
this is not about getting credit .
the stories we tell matter deeply to how we see ourselves , and to how we believe movements are run and how movements are won .
this is a question of whether we 're moving towards more democratic and peaceful societies .
thank you .
( applause )
we live in in a remarkable time , the age of genomics .
your sequence and mine are slightly different .
are you more than your genes ?
`` all right : `` '' i 'm more than my genes '' '' — all together . ''
everybody : i am more than my genes .
now , since you guys are really great , maybe you can humor me and say this all together too .
and in the 1970s and '80s , a team of scientists mapped all 7,000 connections between the neurons .
that 's a lot of information .
and perhaps other aspects of your personal identity — maybe your personality and your intellect — maybe they 're also encoded in the connections between your neurons .
and so now you can see why i proposed this hypothesis : i am my connectome .
they extend long and delicate branches , and in short , they look like trees .
but this is just a single neuron .
except , you still may not really recognize them , and that 's because we have to work in three dimensions .
if we take many images of many slices of the brain and stack them up , we get a three-dimensional image .
and we can do that for another neuron in green .
you should see small circles — these are called vesicles .
and so when the green neuron wants to communicate , it wants to send a message to the red neuron , it spits out neurotransmitter .
so you see how to find a synapse .
how can we find an entire connectome ?
and so i think we 're ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
you already know enough to tell me — what 's wrong with this statement ?
it does n't matter whether you 're a guy or girl , everyone 's brains are like spaghetti .
and so let 's do a series of comparisons to show you .
and a neuron , well , that 's smaller than brain .
and that 's just a mouse brain — it 's a lot smaller than a human brain .
in the 17th century , the mathematician and philosopher , blaise pascal , wrote of his dread of the infinite , his feeling of insignificance at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space .
( laughter ) but may i ? ( laughter )
how could we even dare to think that we might ever understand this ?
it will take the work of generations to succeed .
at the present time , my collaborators and i , what we 're aiming for is much more modest — just to find partial connectomes of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain .
but even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis that i am my connectome .
second question : what causes these changes ?
well , it 's true .
and there 's a lot of evidence that neural activity is encoding our thoughts , feelings and perceptions , our mental experiences . and there 's a lot of evidence that neural activity
and that 's why every connectome is unique , even those of genetically identical twins .
and if you 'll allow me to ascend to metaphorical heights , i will remind you that neural activity is the physical basis — or so neuroscientists think — of thoughts , feelings and perceptions .
and so we might even speak of the stream of consciousness .
let us attempt to read out memories from connectomes .
and this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements .
but it wo n't be easy , because they 're not going to look like this .
so we 'll have to use our computers to try to unscramble the chain .
and if we can do that , the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity that is replayed in the brain during memory recall .
and if that were successful , that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome .
but if you have , you know it 's very easy to make a mistake .
i 'll give you a hint . it 's a big number .
`` and indeed , the popular press loves headlines like , `` anorexic brains are wired differently , '' or `` '' autistic brains are wired differently . '' '' these are plausible claims , but in truth , we ca n't see the brain 's wiring clearly enough to tell if these are really true . ''
sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis is to consider its most extreme implication .
should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality , calling them fools ?
i do n't know — i prefer to test their beliefs , scientifically .
i propose that we attempt to find a connectome of a frozen brain .
we know that damage to the brain occurs after death and during freezing .
the question is : has that damage erased the connectome ?
if it has , there is no way that any future civilization will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains .
on the other hand , if the connectome is still intact , we can not ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily .
all three of the founders of netscape had it .
kids — you can see these signs in kids .
and i told the author , after they did my interview , that i cheated in that same course .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?
and i had these little pillows that i would sew up .
and you could stuff pins in them .
and then i had all the good ones that did n't look crappy . they were 50 cents each .
and they could use those for practice balls .
that 's wrong , for me , if you want to raise entrepreneurs .
so it 's not in our nature to pre-act .
and if you make a three-dimensional structure , like a buckyball , they have all sorts of incredible properties .
in fact , if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire .
so , eventually i decided to pursue an mfa instead of an m.d .
the problem was getting caught .
fortunately for me , my parents were not poetic .
they were pragmatic .
in their own words , i would move out — which i did when i was 18 — i will pay taxes — thanks — ( laughter ) — and they knew the difference between love and fear .
i was not raised with fear .
but i was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable .
i have always regarded myself much like anyone else who navigates the dark unknowns of their own challenges .
now , someone , somewhere , must think that 's remarkable , or i would n't be up here , but let 's consider this for a moment .
okay , anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own . ( laughter ) so we all face challenges , and we all face the dark unknown , which is endemic to most challenges , which is what most of us fear , okay ?
so if you 'd all close your eyes for just a moment , okay ?
okay , nothing very interesting .
shawn marsolais : it goes across . dk : yeah .
sm : and then it 's gradually coming back down again .
dk : yes ! sm : that 's amazing .
j. louchart : i love being blind .
as i know you can see , it 's a spectacular standing ovation at ted .
dk : three hundred and sixty-degree view , so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me .
generally , it 's kind of a fuzzy three-dimensional geometry .
he said it was something like having x-ray vision .
ca : what do you picture that you 're in right now ?
i hear every little movement that every single person makes .
like i say , it 's all that kind of three-dimensional surface geometry all around me .
ca : well , daniel , you have done a spectacular job of helping us all see the world in a different way .
rule number eight : strength does n't always equal success .
the food and drug administration has even approved a race-specific medicine .
so , i was able to stone one adulterer .
thou shall not stereotype .
and the thing is , if they 're not harmful , they 're not to be completely dismissed .
we 've gone to immigration detention centers .
what would it look like if we intervened , with rehabilitation as a core value — with love and compassion as core values ?
many of us , for years , have been battling our inner demons .
do n't you get it ?
because freedom ...
sold i to the merchant ships .
have no fear for atomic energy 'cause none of them can stop the time .
how long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look ?
'cause all i ever had — redemption songs .
'cause all i ever had — redemption songs .
i 'm a contemporary artist with a bit of an unexpected background .
and i think it was a great place to grow up as an artist because i grew up around quirky , colorful characters who were great at making with their hands .
( laughter ) but on the other side of that , though , we were big readers in our house .
so i should talk about art .
( laughter ) or we 'll be here all day with my childhood stories .
a few years ago , i spent months in europe to see the major international art exhibitions that have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world .
but two of the main things : one of it , i was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public , that was accessible .
so i decided , i 'm going to start my own biennial .
i 'm going to organize it and direct it and get it going in the world .
so amongst all the criteria i have , there 's two main things .
one of them , i call my mimaw 's test .
i 'm just going to make the whole thing myself .
( laughter ) and so this is what i did .
i 'm going to do an international biennial ; i need artists from all around the world .
so what i did was i invented a hundred artists from around the world .
i figured out their bios , their passions in life and their art styles , and i started making their work .
well the range is quite a bit .
and i 'm such a technician , so i loved this project , getting to play with all the techniques .
`` this piece , which is called `` '' flipped earth '' '' — she was interested in taking the sky and using it to cleanse barren ground . ''
and so you 're standing there and everything else is dark , but there 's this portal that you want to jump in .
the next artist is kay overstry , and she 's interested in ephemerality and transience .
`` and this piece is `` '' frost . '' '' and what she did was she went out on a cold , dry night and breathed back and forth on the lawn to leave — to leave her life 's mark , the mark of her life . ''
( applause ) and so this is five-foot , five-inches of frost that she left behind .
and they were interested in developing a new , alternative art space , and they needed funding for it , so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects .
well this has sparked a craze in japan , because everyone 's wanting a masterpiece .
`` he draws sticks real good . '' '' ( laughter ) which is one of the best compliments ever . ''
and whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property .
`` this project is called `` '' love nests . '' '' what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him . ''
sylvia 's interested in art training .
( laughter ) and she was thinking about her friends and family who work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries , and she was thinking , what can i make that would be of value to them , in case something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman ?
and so she came up with creating these pocket-sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them .
and so they 're valuable . this is precious metals and gemstones .
so what they do is they move into an area and try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area .
so this is in eastern tennessee , and what they decided was that we need a positive tradition that goes with death .
`` so they came up with `` '' dig jigs . '' '' and a dig jig — a dig jig is where , for a milestone anniversary or a birthday , you gather all your friends and family together and you dance on where you 're going to be buried . ''
i talked my family into doing this , and they did n't know what i was doing .
`` and i was like , `` '' get dressed for a funeral . we 're going to go do some work . '' '' and so we got to the grave and made this , which was hilarious — the attention that we got . ''
and you in essence have a funeral that you get to be present for .
that 's my mom and dad .
he is interested in how we see as an animal , how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage .
there 's another pile of leaves .
like this is a painting of a snake in a box .
`` hazel clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided , `` '' you know , i would learn a lot about culture if i created a culture that does n't exist from scratch . '' '' so that 's what she did . ''
she created the swiss people named the uvulites , and they have this distinctive yodeling song that they use the uvula for .
`` and this is from a documentary called `` '' sexual practices and populations control among the uvulites . '' '' this is a typical angora embroidery for them . ''
this is one of their founders , gert schaeffer .
so this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we 've become .
and he 's reworking a confucian art tradition of scholar stones .
next is roy penig , a really interesting kentucky artist , and he 's the nicest guy .
and she 's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists , even though she 's going to be 90 next year .
`` next is by hilda singh , and she 's doing a whole project called `` '' social outfits . '' '' next is by vera sokolova . ''
next , this is by thomas swifton .
now , maui was terrified of the dark , so i had to carry him up the stairs , actually down the stairs first , for his walk , and then bring him back up .
the stores nearby were out of flashlights and batteries and bread .
i started to prospect under the benches of bakeries and the entrances of pastry shops for plug points .
i was n't the only one .
even in the rain , people stood between madison and 5th avenue under their umbrellas charging their cell phones from outlets on the street .
the self as we once knew it no longer exists , and i think that an abstract , digital universe has become a part of our identity , and i want to talk to you about what i think that means .
a novel needs scene after scene to build , and the story of our life needs an arc as well .
it has shrunk because our instruments enable us in part to measure smaller and smaller units of time , and this in turn has given us a more granular understanding of the material world , and this granular understanding has generated reams of data that our brains can no longer comprehend and for which we need more and more complicated computers .
you and i answer only to nature 's rhythm and flow , to the sun , the moon and the seasons , and this is why we need that long arc of time with the past , the present and the future to see things for what they are , to separate signal from noise and the self from sensations .
so many of us today have the sensation that time 's arrow is pointing everywhere and nowhere at once .
this is because time does n't flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one .
and that 's not all .
this digital now is not the present , because it 's always a few seconds ahead , with twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones .
like it . find other books exactly like his .
there were those with power and water , and those without .
there are those who went back to their lives , and those who are still displaced after so many months .
now if this rift , which is already so great in many parts of the world , between the lack of infrastructure and the spread of technology , is n't somehow bridged , there will be ruptures between the digital and the real .
possibly , but i remember my childhood .
i remember my grandfather revising the capitals of the world with me .
buda and pest were separated by the danube , and vienna had a spanish riding school .
night after night , he took me up on the terrace , on his shoulders , and pointed out jupiter and saturn and the great bear to me .
they 're like soap bubbles that disappear when we touch them .
at such moments , our selves are complete .
attention is time .
one of my yoga instructors once said that love is attention , and definitely from my grandmother , love and attention were one and the same thing .
it threatens the flow of love .
we 've seen again and again just how creative technology can be , and in our lives and in our actions , we can choose those solutions and those innovations and those moments that restore the flow of time instead of fragmenting it .
we can choose to take time back .
thank you .
( applause )
because we are all patients , we are all people .
i mean , they complain about it all the time .
not a lot of cool , sexy stuff happening in dentistry .
they divided them up into two groups .
so that was the low-fear group .
they showed bloody gums .
they showed puss oozing out from between their teeth .
they told them that their teeth were going to fall out .
they said that they could have infections that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies , and ultimately , yes , they would lose their teeth .
that was the message . that was the experiment .
`` so they asked them at the beginning , `` do you think you 'll actually be able to stick with this program ? '' ''
the people who brushed and flossed their teeth were not necessarily the people who were really scared about what would happen — it 's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity to change their behavior .
it was the sense of efficacy .
so i want to isolate this , because it was a great observation — 30 years ago , right , 30 years ago — and it 's one that 's laid fallow in research .
the notion of efficacy basically boils down to one — that if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior .
except , maybe we do .
again , bandura recognized this years ago , decades ago .
but it actually hits home .
there 's an emotional connection to information because it 's from us .
you 've seen them all around , especially these days as radars are cheaper .
but it works , and it even has some health repercussions .
maybe there 's fewer accidents , so there 's public health benefits .
it 's very difficult to line things up so neatly .
actually , it 's a spoof . it 's not a real pharmaceutical ad .
nobody 's had the brilliant idea of calling their drug havidol quite yet .
who among us would actually say that people read this ?
and who among us would actually say that people who do try to read this actually get anything out of it ?
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth medical school , lisa schwartz and steven woloshin .
so let me just walk through this quickly .
and finally , you understand what those choices are .
so it spells those out in very clean terms , and that works .
so i love this . i love that drug facts box .
and god forbid — i think many doctors , if you really asked them , they do n't really understand all this stuff either .
so that 's what i want to walk you through .
so this is the general blood work before , and this is the after , this is what we came up with .
we tell you that you 're okay , you 're normal .
in this case , it 's a sin of omission .
so we start to use the data we have to run a very simple calculation that 's on all sorts of online calculators to get a sense of what the actual risk is .
the last one i 'll show you is a psa test .
in this case it 's about 25 percent , based on that .
( laughter ) quest diagnostics and labcorp , the two largest lab testing companies — last year , they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively .
it 's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change .
it 's being lost .
what are my options ? what choices are now on the table ?
this is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people .
that 's what engagement is . it 's different from compliance .
thank you very much .
( applause )
and i was not existent before .
so , imagine that the building blocks are little atoms and there is a hydrogen here , a carbon here , a nitrogen here .
so the number of atoms , the file that i will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby , will actually fill an entire titanic of thumb drives — multiplied 2,000 times .
this is the miracle of life .
and to build a human , you need three billion of them .
it was an amazing feat .
the rest , we all share it .
it 's an approach that can be used for everything , but using it in genomics is particularly complicated .
it gets shorter , you lose pieces , it gets insertions .
now , after 15 years — 15 years after we read the first sequence — this october , we started to see some signals .
this is a face for us .
we predict his skin color .
that 's his face .
this is a huge challenge .
the prediction will get better , the model will get more precise .
we must start to think of the future we 're building as a humanity .
now what would this mean , and how would we do it ?
and so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time , we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry .
well it requires software , it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks .
we can print drugs at point of need .
well , you 're going to have your own personal matter fabricator .
beam me up , scotty .
in america , even a bankrupt gambler gets a second chance .
for his generation , higher education was free or almost free , because it was thought of as a public good .
not anymore .
not anymore .
getting into debt to buy an expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off with the increased income that you earned from it .
even a college grad earned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013 .
tuition costs up , public funding down , family incomes diminished , personal incomes weak .
is it any wonder that more than a quarter of those who must can not make their student loan payments ?
the u.s. news & world report ranks colleges just as the consumer report rates washing machines .
`` teachers are called `` '' service providers , '' '' students are called `` '' consumers . '' '' sociology and shakespeare and soccer and science , all of these are `` '' content . '' '' student debt is profitable . ''
your debt fattens the profit of the student loan industry .
the two 800-pound gorillas of which — sallie mae and navient — posted last year a combined profit of 1.2 billion dollars .
once from your tuition , and then again from the interest on debt .
diplomas are a brand .
and had they received as they should have , then going to college would have been a bad investment for many .
college premium ?
i think it 's a high school discount .
and the future , for them , does n't look particularly promising — in fact , it 's downright bleak .
so what do we do ?
what if students and parents treated higher education as a consumer product ?
everybody else seems to .
there is such a thing , by the way .
one of you make this .
there 's a second benefit to income-based tuition .
that is manifestly unfair , and should change .
who then , by the way , goes on and earns more money .
getting stimulated by their intelligence , follow paths of inquiry that they really want to .
my students and i work on very tiny robots .
insects move around amazingly well .
this video is from uc berkeley .
the hard material here is silicon , and the soft material is silicone rubber .
so this leads to the robot that i showed you earlier .
we all move in this kind of bouncy way when we run .
so this guy does n't work quite yet , but we do have slightly larger versions that do run around .
but ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot .
we want sensing , power , control , actuation all together , and not everything needs to be bio-inspired .
so there was that big flash , and you can see the robot jumping up through the air .
and we 've made some advances so far , but there 's still a long way to go , and hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination .
`` you ca n't just go off and create a designer baby . '' '' and in fact , to some extent , you 're right . ''
so i 've been talking about this crispr technology .
it 's really that simple .
and they 're going to go for designer babies .
it was a different vienna .
the world was different .
look at china 's one-child policy .
thank you .
so he told everyone , no more hand raising , i 'm cold-calling .
pm : and in the book , you not only found your voice , which is clear and strong in the book , but you also share what you 've learned — the experiences of other people in the lessons .
so i do n't know if i 'm an expert , or if anyone is an expert . i certainly have done a lot of research .
all over the world , no matter what our cultures are , we think men should be strong , assertive , aggressive , have voice ; we think women should speak when spoken to , help others .
if you 're a woman , please raise your hand if you 've ever been told you 're too aggressive at work .
men only .
there is a circle that 's been started for rescued sex workers in miami .
ss : a lot more leaning in .
i 've got a confession .
and that 's because we grew human cells into it .
`` and i 'm like , `` '' you 've come to the right place . '' '' ( laughter ) i actually brought this up with my wife . ''
and this is the result .
speaking of kitchens , here 's some asparagus .
this image reminds me of two things : our blood vessels and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord .
thank you .
thank you very much .
this is a part of the nose of the animaris percipiere .
think of all the problems that we 're facing at the moment .
chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis .
this is what we will do today .
but why ?
this is not poetry ; this is not philosophy .
accountability .
to have somebody guilty in case they fail .
do n't look for clarity ; go for fuzziness .
many times i go around the world to speak , and people ask me questions about the challenges , my moments , some of my regrets .
i went to northern liberia .
and they gave me lodging with a single mother and her daughter .
`` i wish for her to be a nurse . '' '' dirt poor , living in the home with my parents , i could n't afford to . ''
`` the night before i left , she came to the room and said , `` '' leymah , do n't leave me here . ''
i wish to go with you .
till today , i have no idea where those two girls are .
every night i 'd come from work and lie on the cold floor .
she 's highly athletic .
her dream of going to school , her wish of being educated , is finally here .
and for the next three years , her fate will be having sex with him every day , as a favor for getting her in school .
the u.n. has the convention on the rights of the child .
other countries come with different things .
all of these great works by great people aimed at getting young people to where we want to get them globally , i think , has failed .
it 's not enough to say you have two nobel laureates from the republic of liberia when your girls ' kids are totally out there and no hope , or seemingly no hope .
when these girls sit , you unlock intelligence , you unlock passion , you unlock commitment , you unlock focus , you unlock great leaders .
today , we 've worked with over 300 .
and some of those girls who walked in the room very shy have taken bold steps , as young mothers , to go out there and advocate for the rights of other young women .
one young woman i met , teen mother of four , never thought about finishing high school , graduated successfully ; never thought about going to college , enrolled in college .
and you would think she would take that money and put it back into her education .
juanita is her name .
i wish for food for my children .
this girl had a son who wished for a piece of doughnut because he was extremely hungry .
i failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls .
these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman — i failed , i failed , i failed .
not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true , the wish of peace came true .
thank you .
teen pregnancy , like i said , is epidemic .
but i 'm also not pessimistic , because i know it does n't take a lot to get them charged up .
we took 50 of those girls and we worked with them .
this is one place where women were never — even the older ones barely sat in the circle with the men .
`` and the theme they used was : `` even pretty girls vote . '' ''
`` but not only did they do that , they went to those who were running for seats to ask them , `` '' what is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win ? '' '' and one of the guys who already had a seat was very — because liberia has one of the strongest rape laws , and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric . ''
( applause ) ca : leymah , thank you . thank you so much for coming to ted .
lg : you 're welcome . ( ca : thank you . ) ( applause )
i started using a wheelchair 16 years ago when an extended illness changed the way i could access the world .
i could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again .
`` when i asked people their associations with the wheelchair , they used words like `` '' limitation , '' '' `` '' fear , '' '' `` pity '' and `` restriction . '' ''
i realized i 'd internalized these responses and it had changed who i was on a core level .
a part of me had become alienated from myself .
i was working to transform these internalized responses , to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when i started using a wheelchair , by creating unexpected images .
the wheelchair became an object to paint and play with .
well , we 're human .
what might leaning in to relationships even look like ?
well , the possibilities are practically endless .
it stops .
i 'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine , a bosnian friend , about what happened to her , because i think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like .
great person .
`` and she remembers struggling with her mother to the front , crowds and crowds of people , `` '' take my child ! take my child ! '' '' and passing her son to someone through a window . ''
and she did n't see him for years .
i had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege , and i say i have the honor and the privilege of being there because it 's taught me everything , not just about being a reporter , but about being a human being .
most of all , i learned about love .
even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , i learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who 's being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life , helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals .
last april , i went back to a very strange — what i called a deranged high school reunion .
`` what it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of sarajevo , and i do n't like the word `` '' anniversary , '' '' because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party . ''
they stay because you want to stay in your home .
and then war and chaos descend .
and there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes .
and an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story , or i find it beautiful .
there was no kind of compensation for , you 're a tutsi , you 're a hutu , you might have killed my mother , you might have killed my father .
when i go back to syria , next week in fact , what i see is incredibly heroic people , some of them fighting for democracy , for things we take for granted every single day .
in 2004 , i had a little baby boy , and i call him my miracle child , because after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life , this ray of hope was born .
i 'm not kofi annan . he ca n't stop a war .
i 'm not a u.n. conflict resolution person .
my role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless .
and that 's what i try to do .
who cares about the congo , the ivory coast , liberia , sierra leone , all of these strings of places that i will remember for the rest of my life ?
thank you very much .
( applause )
it changed our view of the physical world .
this is the skyline of my hometown , new orleans .
half the city is already below sea level .
climate change is affecting our homes , our communities , our way of life . we should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity .
so what can we do ? how can we prepare and adapt ?
now these are examples of new orleans rebuilding in this way , but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind .
imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue .
in ethiopia , 70 percent , that 's 7-0 percent of the population , depends on rainfall for its livelihood .
sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems , agriculture , even major cities . this is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the mekong delta .
infrastructure is going to be affected .
airports around the world are located on the coast .
here 's just one example , san francisco airport , with 16 inches or more of flooding .
for example , in land use , which areas do you want to protect , through adding a seawall , for example , alter , by raising buildings , or retreat from , to allow the migration of important natural systems , such as wetlands or beaches ?
why ? well , there are no experts .
there are no quick fixes .
we 're all learning by doing .
or take another example : big data .
it was outlawed in chicago for a while .
it 's pending here in california , and just recently in new york .
the reasons usually just boil down to the gavage , which is the force feeding .
( laughter ) i mean , i love the stuff .
and for good reason .
and they 've been doing it quietly ever since .
he placed first for his foie gras .
but he was still going like this .
and he stopped doing this .
there 's figs and everything else there for the taking .
extra difficult . extra hard .
not for the bush , but for the seeds .
it was never him .
because , really , they want you to look at themselves , right ?
and we 're sitting there , and i hear [ clapping ] from a distance , so i look over .
and this squadron of geese come over .
think about that for a minute .
i 'm really in love with him at this point .
but i can taste things .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what ?
and as he said , i think fittingly , it 's a gift from god , with god saying , you 've done good work .
i really was moved .
most of what we eat today .
( mosquito buzzing ) ( swat ) gotcha .
do n't you ?
knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood ? that 's awful , right ?
when they fly into our bedroom at night , they prefer to bite my wife .
but that 's fascinating , right ?
and therefore , we set up various experiments .
why did we set up these experiments ?
well , in africa , we have the equivalent of seven jumbo 747s crashing every day .
but perhaps if we can attract these mosquitos to traps , bait it with our smell , we may be able to stop transmission of disease .
first , we observed that not all mosquito species bite on the same part of the body . strange .
in contrast , the african malarial mosquito had a very strong preference for biting the ankles and feet of this person , and that of course we should have known all along because they 're called mosqui-toes , you see ? ( laughter ) that 's right . ( applause ) and so we started focusing on the smell of feet , on the smell of human feet , until we came across a remarkable statement in the literature that said that cheese smells after feet rather than the reverse . think of it .
in fact , it worked so well that now we have a synthetic mixture of the aroma of limburger cheese that we 're using in tanzania and has been shown there to be two to three times more attractive to mosquitos than humans .
limburg , be proud of your cheese , as it is now used in the fight against malaria .
and i will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria .
in that pool of water , these larvae are concentrated .
ooh , that was very quick .
he 's going back to check the control holes again , but he 's coming back to the first one , and now he 's locking into that smell , which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field , and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria .
since we also know that people that carry malaria parasites smell different compared to people that are uninfected , she 's convinced that we can train dogs to find people that carry the parasite .
it 's a crazy story , but i believe it 's perhaps the best and ultimate revenge against mosquitos ever .
and the answer i have right here in my pocket , if i get it .
thank you .
now , on the video , on the video here , i 'm going to show you exactly the same thing , except that what i 'm showing you on the video happened one hour after i took the tablet .
i 'm sticking in my arm , i 'm giving them a big juicy blood meal , i 'm shaking them off , and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very , very sick indeed , here shown in fast motion , and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos , very dead mosquitos , and i 'm going to say , ladies and gentlemen , we have swapped the cards with mosquitos .
now think of what we can do with this .
you can see hillary clinton on the right .
you guys want to see some ?
but some of your neurons right here in your motor cortex are going to send messages down when you move your arm like this .
i grew up in a very small village in canada , and i 'm an undiagnosed dyslexic .
in fact , my mother told me eventually that i was the little kid in the village who cried all the way to school .
then she took me to see a film that i really did n't want to see .
i have four kids , and even if part of what he says is true , they 're not going to have the life that i had .
and i decided at that moment that i would spend the rest of my life doing whatever i could to improve their possibilities .
we decided to give back locally .
the teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard .
the desks are not square .
at green school , the children are smiling — an unusual thing for school , especially for me .
and we practice holism .
and for me it 's just the idea that , if this little girl graduates as a whole person , chances are she 'll demand a whole world — a whole world — to live on .
would he have had more possibilities in his life ?
the classrooms have natural light .
they 're beautiful . they 're bamboo .
these bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree .
and these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future .
the first one was called sanding and the second one was called re-waxing .
but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar .
and you know what these are .
these are compost toilets , and nobody at the school wanted to know about them , especially the principal .
it 's something you should think about doing .
the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months .
the teachers dragged giant pvc whiteboards into the classrooms .
so we had some good ideas : we took old automobile windshields , put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard .
there 's an amazing river traveling through it , and you can see there how we manage to get across the river .
it 's becoming a green model .
we had to look at everything .
there are no sidewalks .
the sidewalks are gravel . they flood when it rains , but they 're green .
he 's planning to eat that fence for dinner .
they took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen , sliced them thinly and made delicious chips .
we made space for these guys who are bali 's last black pigs .
green school is going into its third year with 160 children .
you practice ancient balinese arts .
the mothers are n't quite convinced .
`` ( laughter ) we 've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives , and we said , okay , local , what does `` '' local '' '' mean ? ''
a man came from java with a new kind of organic agriculture .
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global , green leaders .
the green school effect — we do n't know what it is .
and all the kids are thriving .
on giant grass .
it comes out of the ground like a train .
it 's a double helix .
it has administrators in it and many , many other things .
`` and the problem of building it — when the balinese workers saw long reams of plans , they looked at them and said , `` '' what 's this ? '' '' so we built big models . ''
we believe it is .
green school is a model we built for the world .
and you just have to follow these simple , simple rules : be local , let the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build .
so , mr. gore , thank you .
thank you .
what words to use ?
i will show you that they know what matters most in a family , even though their family looks a little different .
`` one said , `` '' my parents did not have good seeds , but there are friendly men out there who have spare seeds . ''
but i will not put him on the ground .
and why not ?
and we had another couple who made books — a book for each child .
they even had the hospital parking tickets in there .
but it is the reaction of his father that is most interesting .
these things happen in all families .
these parents , too .
and their uncertainties were present long before they even were parents .
`` like , `` '' milk — is that made in a factory ? '' '' we will say , `` '' no , it comes from cows , '' '' and we will talk about the farmer , and the way the milk ends up in the shop . ''
so , you know , i have a friend at school , and she 's made in the same way .
remember the books and the trip to the farmer ?
i met a guy — the guy on the left .
so let 's go back to sudan .
there 's just one of them .
how is a consumer going to walk through this minefield ?
sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue .
a hundred companies , we can work with .
eight entities came to the table .
meet tony . he 's my student .
`` so when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and i say , `` '' in this class , we will discuss the foundations of ethics , '' '' tony interrupts me . ''
then can you tell me what wrong is ?
i want to know about wrongness itself , the idea of wrong .
`` i want to know what i know . '' '' what tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy , the project that begins in wonder — what kant called `` '' admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within . '' '' what can creatures like us know of such things ? ''
`` let us think about that . '' '' because in that moment , there 's no mark by tony 's name ; it 's just the two of us standing there . ''
`` and i say to tony , `` let 's do this . '' ''
ec : beatbox started here in new york .
np : why do n't we give them a little peek , just a tiny bit of our jam session ?
get on up ! come on , stretch !
thank you !
how about a moderate amount of stress ?
yeah . me too .
but i have changed my mind about stress , and today , i want to change yours .
it 's getting more oxygen to your brain .
and participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance , well , they were less stressed out , less anxious , more confident , but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed .
it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage .
i want to make you better at stress .
but this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in .
it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about .
okay , so the bad news first : for every major stressful life experience , like financial difficulties or family crisis , that increased the risk of dying by 30 percent .
people who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related increase in dying .
dear friends , for centuries we were taught anger is bad .
they brought new utensils .
they gathered . food was cooked .
then i sat down where the food was lying .
how did they punish me ?
so i decided to drop my name .
does anybody know ?
no .
i also learned how the most uncontrollable form of energy could be harnessed for good and making society better .
but when i was waiting for my train to come back to my hometown , delhi , i saw that dozens of children were arriving ; they were being trafficked by someone .
but i did not stop .
and i am so lucky that not once , as i said before , but thousands of times , i have been able to witness my god in the faces of those children and they are my biggest inspirations .
that 's real depression , and that 's what i suffer from .
we do n't see it on facebook . we do n't see it on twitter .
i was suicidal , and if you were to look at my life on the surface , you would n't see a kid who was suicidal .
it 's the roommate you ca n't kick out . it 's the voice you ca n't ignore .
that 's the stigma , because unfortunately , we live in a world where if you break your arm , everyone runs over to sign your cast , but if you tell people you 're depressed , everyone runs the other way .
so we need to stop the ignorance , stop the intolerance , stop the stigma , and stop the silence , and we need to take away the taboos , take a look at the truth , and start talking , because the only way we 're going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together , by standing strong together .
in 1987 , tina lord found herself in quite the pickle .
and here 's what that means for us .
i was one too .
every six months , everyone gets evaluated , anonymously , as a leader .
there 's only three things you need to know : how much people make inside the company , how much people make somewhere else in a similar business and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it .
and more , even when we had thousands of people , 5,000 people , we had two people in the h.r . department , and thankfully one of them has retired .
we 've come from an age of revolution , industrial revolution , an age of information , an age of knowledge , but we 're not any closer to the age of wisdom .
how we design , how do we organize , for more wisdom ?
so for example , many times , what 's the smartest or the intelligent decision does n't jive .
so we 'd say things like , let 's agree that you 're going to sell 57 widgets per week .
how am i supposed to work ? where am i going to be in 5 years ' time ?
going from a math class , to biology , to 14th-century france is very silly .
so can you all hit yourself on the head ?
and the kids are in groups that do n't have an age category , so the six-year-old kid who is ready for that with an 11-year-old , that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups and this stuff that we have in the schools , in general .
and people will sign up for a 45-day course on building a bicycle .
now , try to build a bicycle without knowing that pi is 3.1416 .
and i did another stroll around , and the second time , another question came to me , which did me better , which was , why do i want to be remembered at all ?
and that did two things .
( laughter ) which is good .
and the second thing is , i freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever .
i 'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch in part of those terminal days .
( laughter ) and with this rationale , i look at these days and i think , i 'm not retired . i do n't feel retired at all .
and so i 'm writing a new book .
i 'm now working on getting this school system for free out into the world , and i 've found , very interestingly enough , that nobody wants it for free .
and if we 're looking for wisdom , we need to learn to do that as well .
because the first why you always have a good answer for .
the second why , it starts getting difficult .
what am i doing this for ?
the pieces i 'm trying to put together are this : your ideas are so radical .
how , in business , for example , these ideas have been out for a while , probably the percentage of businesses that have taken some of them is still quite low .
you 're running a company with a 90-day mandate .
if you 're not good in 90 days , you 're out .
( laughter ) ca : what you 're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound .
everyone is bothered about their country 's education system .
we have variations of this one question , from three onwards .
ricardo semler , thank you so much .
rs : thank you so much .
it 's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality .
you will surely find the perfect match .
there are some dilemmas you see .
in all cases , the life support was removed , and the infants had died .
was it something that took place overnight ?
young people did n't turn out to vote in great numbers , but those that did wanted to remain .
older people really wanted to leave the european union .
those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously .
it 's about globalization .
but those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation .
when we look at the voting patterns across the united kingdom , we can visibly see the divisions .
but for a significant majority of the leave voters the concern was disillusionment with the political establishment .
we see it with the rise in popularity of donald trump in the united states , with the growing nationalism of viktor orbán in hungary , with the increase in popularity of marine le pen in france .
but globalization also has redistributive effects .
it creates winners and losers .
to take the example of migration , we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole under almost all circumstances .
in 2002 , the former secretary-general of the united nations , kofi annan , gave a speech at yale university , and that speech was on the topic of inclusive globalization .
that was the speech in which he coined that term .
and i think , as a social scientist , that social science offers some places to start .
it has to be about lifelong civic participation and public engagement that we all encourage as societies .
it shows tragically that those people who voted to leave the european union were those who actually benefited the most materially from trade with the european union .
but one hypothesis that i think emerges from a cursory look at that data is the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization .
i am still british .
( applause )
what if you could bring with you just a few packets of seeds , and grow crops in a matter of hours ?
astronauts would breathe out carbon dioxide , that carbon dioxide would then be captured by the microbes and converted into a nutritious , carbon-rich crop .
we need carbon to survive as humans , and we get our carbon from food .
well , modern agriculture simply can not sustainably scale to meet that demand .
what does that look like ?
so you and i are direct beneficiaries of removed rainforests .
these are all products of microbes .
ten thousand times over a period of a year .
so this is what i mean by a new type of agriculture .
but it does n't have to be this way .
thank you very much .
she went to school to get the information because that 's where the information lived .
it was purchased the year i was born , and it was extraordinary , because i did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information .
in the time that passes between when i was a kid in high school and when i started teaching , we really see the advent of the internet .
they produced flyers . they called offices .
they checked schedules . they were meeting with secretaries .
`` the older teachers — more experienced — looked at me and went , `` oh , there she is . that 's so cute . she 's trying to get that done . '' ''
but i knew that the kids would show up , and i believed it , and i told them every week what i expected out of them .
i had to just sit and watch .
from kansas , i moved on to lovely arizona , where i taught in flagstaff for a number of years , this time with middle school students .
but what was interesting about this position i found myself in in arizona , was i had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school , and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities .
and so we chose to look at paul rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive .
nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer , but they were into it . and i asked them to put their own voice over it .
i moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that i knew that kids learned , and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past , of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when i was in school , and to a moment when we have information surplus .
and here 's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you 've given the tool to acquire information to students , is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process .
i asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info-graphics that existed in a lot of mass media , and take a look at what were the interesting components of it , and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from american history .
`` and when i sat the students down , i said , `` '' who 's got the best one ? '' '' and they immediately went , `` '' there it is . '' '' did n't read anything . `` `` there it is . '' '' and i said , `` '' well what makes it great ? '' '' and they 're like , `` '' oh , the design 's good , and he 's using good color . ''
`` and there 's some ... `` '' and they went through all that we processed out loud . ''
and when we do another round of this in my class this year , they will do better this time , because learning has to include an amount of failure , because failure is instructional in the process .
there are a million pictures that i could click through here , and had to choose carefully — this is one of my favorites — of students learning , of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information , but instead , ask them what they can do with it .
ask them really interesting questions .
this is one of my favorite photos , because this was taken on tuesday , when i asked the students to go to the polls .
the main point is that , if we continue to look at education as if it 's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning , empowering student voice and embracing failure , we 're missing the mark .
how did this happen , reasonable people might ask .
the restaurant business in seattle ? booming .
balancing the power of capitalists like me and workers is n't bad for capitalism .
i want to talk to you about the future of medicine .
now , the reason for the dominance of this model is of course the antibiotic revolution .
so what do we do about this idea ?
take a disease like cancer .
and finally there 's the level of the environment , is n't there ?
you know , we do n't think of cancer as altering the environment .
we 're trying to change the metabolic milieu for other forms of cancer .
and one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own mris .
and so what had happened , really , is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift .
how would we grow these cells ?
could you patent an environment ?
but we need new models to think about medicine in the future .
this is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways .
and this is basically the result we had before .
it turns out that tears just are n't much help when you 're trying to investigate a genocide .
and that 's the fight against global poverty .
and griselda 's not the only one .
so for me , as a lawyer , of course , my first reaction was to think , well , of course we 've got to change all the laws .
we 've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal .
but then i found out , it already is .
but what if there was no law enforcement to protect you ?
the path forward is really pretty clear .
ca : but to make this happen , you have to look at each part in the chain — the police , who else ?
gary haugen .
( applause )
it could be a very dry subject .
we know that there is controversy .
we also hear about the storehouse of biodiversity .
while many believe it , few know it .
we 'll start by thinking that water is like blood .
the circulation in our body distributes fresh blood , which feeds , nurtures and supports us , and brings the used blood back to be renewed .
in the amazon , things happen similarly .
the equatorial region , in general , and the amazon specifically , is extremely important for the world 's climate .
if we take a look at this other image , which shows the water vapor flow , you have dry air in black , moist air in gray , and clouds in white .
what phenomenon — if it 's not a desert , what phenomenon makes water gush from the ground into the atmosphere with such power that it can be seen from space ?
do you know how much that is ?
a gigantic kettle , right ?
if you look at the world map — it 's easy to see this — you 'll see that there are forests in the equatorial zone , and deserts are organized at 30 degrees north latitude , 30 degrees south latitude , aligned .
if we could use the analogy of the blood circulating in our bodies , like the water circulating in the landscape , we see that rivers are veins , they drain the landscape , they drain the tissue of nature .
this river has a pulse .
you can see the different seasons there .
we , scientists — you see that i 'm struggling here to move my head from one side to the other .
above the amazon , there is clean air , as there is clean air above the ocean .
you can rest assured that you are breathing the purest air on earth , here in the amazon , because the plants take care of this characteristic as well .
as in the upper airways of our lungs , the air in the amazon gets cleaned up from the excess of dust .
there is another fractal analogy .
like endocrinal glands and hormones , there are those gases which i told you about before , that are formed and released into the atmosphere , like hormones , which help in the formation of rain .
like the liver and the kidneys , as i 've said , cleaning the air .
the desert is trapped in this condition . it will always be dry .
this image shows those paths , all the hurricanes that have been recorded .
this pump that sucks the moisture into the continent also speeds up the air above the sea , and this prevents hurricane formations .
i 'm not talking only about the amazon .
the amazon teaches us a lesson on how pristine nature works .
if we could establish forests in those other areas , we can reverse climate change , including global warming .
we need to do this .
having closed this quick introduction , we see the reality that we have out here , which is drought , this climate change , things that we already knew .
how could he know that ?
if we do n't see , we do n't register the information .
we 're trampling on this wonderful cosmos that shelters us and houses us .
let 's dive , let 's reach out the reality we live in every day , and look carefully at it , since that 's what we need .
even with hubble up there — this is a bird's-eye view , right ?
even when this happens , we also see something that we do n't know .
each tree , each tree top , has up to 10,000 species of insects in it , let alone the millions of species of fungi , bacteria , etc .
a robotic hand is technological , mine is biological , and we do n't think about it anymore .
let 's zoom in on it .
hitachi has now made a monitor that uses this technology , and it is used in optical fibers to transmit — janine benyus , who 's been here several times , talks about it : biomimetics .
there are ted talks about it . i wo n't talk much longer , but each person in this room , including myself , has 100 trillion of these micromachines in their body , so that we can enjoy well-being .
imagine what is out there in the amazon forest : 100 trillion . this is greater than the number of stars in the sky .
and we are not aware of it .
metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery .
( applause )
so i began to work with national geographic society and others and led expeditions to antarctica .
and i 'm going to tell you that story here in a moment .
but before i do , i just want you to ponder this graph for a moment .
you can see the islands — there are eight islands — that pop out of the water .
and these nations are faced with a real problem .
after i got back , i said , okay , this is amazing , what we found .
it 's the only threat , the only influence that the reef had to deal with .
and we are now in the process of raising the full endowment .
( video ) samantha : aaaaaah .
the fever climbed and climbed .
they flagged down a cab and took him to the hospital .
if you look back through history , most people died the way my great uncle died .
my great uncle died in the last days of the pre-antibiotic era .
in fact , they already are .
briefly , it works like this .
other bacteria , to protect themselves , evolve defenses against that chemical attack .
vancomycin arrived in 1972 , vancomycin resistance in 1988 .
a project chartered by the british government known as the review on antimicrobial resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700,000 deaths a year .
after all , the first person to receive penicillin , a british policeman named albert alexander , who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye , was infected by doing something very simple .
it takes pharmaceutical chemistry 10 years to derive a new drug .
we do n't do those things anymore .
we could forgo giving an antibiotic if we 're not sure it 's the right one .
in just 70 years , we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster .
but in the 1970s , some countries caught up .
there is the gallery somewhere in the world , and there is a young girl , age 23 , standing in the middle of the space .
but also the knife , the razor blade , the hammer and the pistol with one bullet .
i was a mess .
you go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable .
i was recently traveling in the highlands of new guinea , and i was talking with a man who had three wives .
and you 've got to have a lot of cows , a lot of goats , a lot of money , a lot of land , in order to build a harem .
i 'm going to say almost not at all .
fourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire , and i 've been able to watch who 's naturally drawn to whom .
we have natural patterns of mate choice .
it 's actually women piling into the job market in cultures around the world .
the double-income family was the rule .
( applause ) kelly stoetzel : thank you so much for that , helen .
as you know , there 's another speaker here with us that works in your same field .
and we have shifted it to a model of free choice and individual rights , and self-fulfillment and happiness .
and so , that was the first thing i thought , that the need does n't change , but the context and the way we regulate these relationships changes a lot .
and then comes ghosting .
in one , i used nasa supercomputers to design next-generation spacecraft , and in the other i was a data scientist looking for potential smugglers of sensitive nuclear technologies .
as a data scientist , i did a lot of analyses , mostly of facilities , industrial facilities around the world .
although i was a satellite engineer , i had n't thought about using satellite imagery in my work .
but i was intrigued .
i mean , satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff .
how much oil is stored in all of china ?
how much corn is being produced ?
so why do all of this ? why build these satellites ?
so we were pretty reassured by this .
a perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth , and in his case , as you can see , the right part of his brain has gone .
and that has been really a tough time .
but one day we found that mario was not looking at our hand .
this short video is from last week .
and we thank you so much , all of you .
ff : thank you . rd : thank you . bye .
but it 's not enough .
she was growing frustrated and kind of withdrawn and acting out in class .
then they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade and brianna was devastated .
think about it : 11.5 million documents , containing the secrets of people from more than 200 different countries .
the reason journalists are scared of technology is this : the profession 's largest institutions are going through tough times because of the changing way that people are consuming news .
but where there is crisis , there is also opportunity .
there were only two rules for everyone who was invited : we all agreed to share everything that we found with everybody else , and we all agreed to publish together on the same day .
they 'd been using the address to register their offshore company .
the technology — the internet — that has broken the business model is allowing us to reinvent journalism itself .
try stopping the inevitable .
thank you .
we had to calm them down .
gr : thank you .
she could n't wait to get out of her parents ' house , to prove to them that she 's an adult , and to prove to her new friends that she belongs .
now , i 'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training .
so when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago , it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change .
ss : i normally talk about language .
ss ( video ) : very nice . beautiful , panbanisha .
( applause )
so what we 're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
this tool that i 'm using here is a little experiment .
and , right away , i see there 's a different pattern that emerges .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we filter by age — say 40 years or less — we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info-graphic .
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrated ever produced .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
`` ( applause ) now , if i want to just kind of take a peek at these , i might think , `` well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? '' ''
and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way — going narrower , broader , backing in , backing out — you 're not searching , you 're not browsing .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one wikipedia page .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize winners .
and i can sort of replay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
i had extensive and life-threatening injuries .
my head was cut open across the front , lifted back , exposing the skull underneath .
by the time the helicopter arrived at prince henry hospital in sydney , my blood pressure was 40 over nothing .
`` `` come on . stay with me . we can do it . we can do it together . '' ''
after 10 days , i made the decision to return to my body , and the internal bleeding stopped .
the vertebra at l1 was like you 'd dropped a peanut , stepped on it , smashed it into thousands of pieces .
`` i woke up in intensive care , and the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success because at that stage i had a little bit of movement in one of my big toes , and i thought , `` '' great , because i 'm going to the olympics ! '' '' ( laughter ) i had no idea . that 's the sort of thing that happens to someone else , not me , surely . ''
the central nervous system nerves , there is no cure .
`` and if you walk again , it will be with calipers and a walking frame . '' '' and then she said , `` '' janine , you 'll have to rethink everything you do in your life , because you 're never going to be able to do the things you did before . '' '' i tried to grasp what she was saying . ''
i was an athlete . that 's all i knew . that 's all i 'd done .
i had no movement in my legs . i had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots .
and there were no superficial conversations as we shared our innermost thoughts , our fears , and our hopes for life after the spinal ward .
`` and when we 'd finished , he went around silently and he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward , and then he said , `` okay , everybody , hold on to your straws . '' ''
`` and we did . and he said , `` '' right . now we 're all connected . '' '' and as we held on , and we breathed as one , we knew we were n't on this journey alone . ''
and each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward we would never be the same .
after six months , it was time to go home .
i soaked it up and i thought , how could i ever have taken this for granted ?
`` but before i left the hospital , the head nurse had said to me , `` '' janine , i want you to be ready , because when you get home , something 's going to happen . '' '' and i said , `` '' what ? '' '' and she said , `` you 're going to get depressed . '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' not me , not janine the machine , '' '' which was my nickname . ''
`` she said , `` '' you are , because , see , it happens to everyone . ''
i did get depressed .
and i wanted to give up .
maria was in a car accident , and she woke up on her 16th birthday to the news that she was a complete quadriplegic , had no movement from the neck down , had damage to her vocal chords , and she could n't talk .
`` they told me , `` '' we 're going to move you next to her because we think it will be good for her . '' '' i was worried . i did n't know how i 'd react to being next to her . ''
she was always happy , and even when she began to talk again , albeit difficult to understand , she never complained , not once .
and i wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance .
i had never before thought of myself as a creative person .
but now i was about to embark on the most creative project that any of us could ever do : that of rebuilding a life .
`` if i ca n't walk , then i might as well fly . '' '' i said , `` '' mom , i 'm going to learn how to fly . '' '' she said , `` '' that 's nice , dear . '' '' ( laughter ) i said , `` '' pass me the yellow pages . '' '' she passed me the phone book , i rang up the flying school , i made a booking , said i 'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight . ''
it was beautiful . they lifted me into the cockpit .
`` i said , `` '' no , i ca n't use my legs . '' '' he went , `` '' oh . '' '' i said , `` '' but i can use my hands , '' '' and he said , `` '' okay . '' '' so he got over to the runway , and he applied the power . ''
and as we took off down the runway , and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac , and we became airborne , i had the most incredible sense of freedom .
`` and andrew said to me , as we got over the training area , `` you see that mountain over there ? '' ''
`` and i said , `` '' yeah . '' '' and he said , `` '' well , you take the controls , and you fly towards that mountain . '' '' and as i looked up , i realized that he was pointing towards the blue mountains where the journey had begun . ''
did n't know how on earth i 'd ever pass a medical .
and then i learned to fly an airplane with two engines and i got my twin engine rating .
and then i learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather and got my instrument rating .
and then i got my commercial pilot 's license .
and then i got my instructor rating .
and then i found myself back at that same school where i 'd gone for that very first flight , teaching other people how to fly , just under 18 months after i 'd left the spinal ward .
the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us .
and that 's actually what drew me to the mola in the first place , was this terribly bizarre shape .
so we 've got to figure out how they 're living their lives .
i 'm going to show you our latest dataset .
i set up a website because i was getting so many questions about molas and sunfish .
now , we can all do something .
( applause )
they were constantly short of cash .
it is trillions , it 's not billions .
it was introduced only in the united states .
but we came across a new phenomenon .
now he 's asleep . let 's wake him up .
`` it comes from `` '' robota . '' '' it means `` '' forced labor . '' '' marco tempest : but these robots were not real . ''
edi is different .
edi is real .
your world is ours . you — mt : as i was saying , besides the faces and bodies we give our robots , we can not read their intentions , and that makes us nervous .
mt : which is why humans and robots find it difficult to work in close proximity .
much as the victorians faked their mechanical marvels , we can add a layer of deception to help us feel more comfortable with our robotic friends .
with that in mind , i set about teaching edi a magic trick .
edi : yeah . it 's all part of the illusion , marco .
technology can do the same .
to create the robotic illusion , we 've devised a set of ethical rules , a code that all robots would live by .
mt : we anthropomorphize our machines .
we give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice .
edi : i am edi .
i became operational at ted in march 2014 .
mt : we let them entertain us .
( music ) thank you .
what is it , the cartoon ? is it really about lemmings ?
it starts with an m .
many organizations are offering these online courses to students all over the world , in the millions , for free .
what 's changed ?
whoop-de-do .
and the person you see at the end of the stage is not madonna .
now , we 've all heard of distance education , but the students way in the back , 200 feet away from the instructor , i think they are undergoing long-distance education .
given education has been calcified for 500 years , we really can not think about reengineering it , micromanaging it .
we have to go to completely online grading and peer interaction and discussion boards .
so at edx and a number of other organizations , we are applying these technologies to education through moocs to really increase access to education .
and we had no marketing budget .
when my daughter turned 13 , became a teenager , she stopped speaking english , and she began speaking this new language .
`` `` honey , come over for dinner . '' ''
i said , no , that must have been by accident .
i said , this is great .
and so since then , our life has changed .
now , i 'm older , and my youthful looks might belie that , but i 'm not in the millennial generation .
in fact , i believe — and i have two fat thumbs , i ca n't text very well — but i 'm willing to bet that with evolution , our kids and their grandchildren will develop really , really little , itty-bitty thumbs to text much better , that evolution will fix all of that stuff .
they can have discussions amongst themselves .
they can work with the professor and have the professor answer their questions .
just wait a little bit longer as we experiment with this some more , but the early results are incredible .
now before we go too far into this , i 'd like to spend some time discussing some key ideas .
you teach by asking questions .
students learn much better when they are interacting with the material .
i mean , how else do you teach 150,000 students ?
and we 've all submitted homeworks , and your grades come back two weeks later , you 've forgotten all about it .
some are never graded .
if they get it wrong , they can get instant feedback .
the next big idea is gamification .
so as this little video shows here , you can engage students much like they design with legos .
when we did our circuits course for the 155,000 students , i did n't sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course .
i told my tas , okay , 24/7 , we 're going to be up monitoring the forum , answering questions .
boom , boom , boom , boom , the students were discussing and interacting with each other , and by 4 a.m. that night , i 'm totally fascinated , having this epiphany , and by 4 a.m. in the morning , they had discovered the right answer .
and these kinds of technologies really help , the blended model can really help revolutionize education .
we will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces .
the aakash is 40 dollars .
thank you .
but it 's applicable , again , to every organ system .
many of those patients are very severely burned .
that 's why people often confuse me with a gps .
and this can make basic communication a challenge .
my dad 's the guy with the cigarette .
that 's the humanitarian mission .
there is a glass bridge that you walk across that’s suspended in space .
the connection is the energy it takes to run the web , and to make everything we think possible , possible .
books tell us who we 've been , who we are , who we will be , too .
and so six years ago , a thought leapt to mind : if life passed into pages , there were , somewhere , passages written about every age .
i could assemble them into a life , a long life , a hundred-year life , the entirety of that same great sequence through which the luckiest among us pass .
i was prone to meditating on time and age .
here we were at every annual step through our first hundred years .
it had happened to him , as to them .
and looking back over it , i know that i am not done .
today , many people who live in the emerging markets , where 90 percent of the world 's population lives , believe that the western obsession with political rights is beside the point , and what is actually important is delivering on food , shelter , education and healthcare .
the fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the western ideological systems of politics and economics , and this is a system that is embodied by china .
and rather than have private capitalism , they have state capitalism .
first of all , it 's china 's economic performance over the past 30 years .
so in its totality , economic improvement has been quite significant .
however , these two countries have the identical gini coefficient , which is a measure of income equality .
thirdly , people in the emerging markets look at china 's amazing and legendary infrastructure rollout .
if you travel to mogadishu , mexico city or mumbai , you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas .
`` ladies and gentlemen , it 's no surprise that around the world , people are pointing at what china is doing and saying , `` '' i like that . i want that . ''
in particular , there is growing doubt among people in the emerging markets , when people now believe that democracy is no longer to be viewed as a prerequisite for economic growth .
in fact , countries like taiwan , singapore , chile , not just china , have shown that actually , it 's economic growth that is a prerequisite for democracy .
in a recent study , the evidence has shown that income is the greatest determinant of how long a democracy can last .
freedom house finds that although 50 percent of the world 's countries today are democratic , 70 percent of those countries are illiberal in the sense that people do n't have free speech or freedom of movement .
but also , we 're finding from freedom house in a study that they published last year that freedom has been on the decline every year for the past seven years .
but it also says that as china moves toward being the largest economy in the world , something that is expected to happen by experts in 2016 , that this schism between the political and economic ideologies of the west and the rest is likely to widen .
now the fact of the matter is , if the west decides to compete , it will create a wider schism .
in this vein , we can increase economic growth .
ultimately , it 's about transforming the world and making it a better place .
( applause )
pm : and when you arrived at the hospital , what was the prognosis that they gave you about gabby 's condition and what recovery , if any , you could expect ?
pm : and there were certain words , too .
what attracts you to gabby ?
gg : no , no , no .
mk : yeah , we were friends for a long time .
where 'd we go , gabby ?
mk : yes . our first date was to death row at the florence state prison in arizona , which was just outside gabby 's state senate district .
we 've been together ever since . gg : yes .
mk : i guess .
pm : gabby , what did make you want to marry mark ?
actually , you did n't even live together .
pm : well it was the way you did it . gg : yes , yes . fast pace .
pm : installing solar panels on the top of her house , i have to say .
but i knew she was— gg : yes . yes . yes .
pm : is that for appetizer or dessert , mark ?
pm : but there was a lot of conversation about something you did , gabby , after mark 's flight .
and gabby , what 's on the agenda now ?
what are you doing that 's different than other efforts to balance rights for gun ownership and responsibilities ?
he started doing better .
i 'm working hard , lots of therapy — speech therapy , physical therapy , and yoga too .
but my spirit is strong as ever .
be a leader . set an example .
be passionate . be courageous .
be your best . thank you very much .
i moved to america 12 years ago with my wife terry and our two kids .
we 've invaded every country we 've encountered .
it actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis .
the trouble is , it 's all going in the wrong direction .
there are three principles on which human life flourishes , and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure .
i 'm not here to argue against science and math .
a real education has to give equal weight to the arts , the humanities , to physical education .
it 's a real achievement to put that particular ability out , or to stifle it .
teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools .
an old friend of mine — actually very old , he 's dead .
the role of a teacher is to facilitate learning .
that 's one of the problems of the test .
it 's a human system .
in the winter of 2004 , it rained in death valley .
seven inches of rain fell over a very short period .
and if the movement is strong enough , that 's , in the best sense of the word , a revolution .
anyone in the room thought about sex today ?
it was n't until about 500 million years ago that we start to see structures akin to a penis or a thing that gives dna out , and a vagina , something that receives it .
for many decades , biologists actually felt that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether .
it actually has a level of dexterity in its penis much akin to what we have with our hands .
now if you 've ever been out for a nice , peaceful walk by the lake and happened to see some ducks having sex , you 've undoubtedly been alarmed , because it looks like gang rape .
and quite frankly , that 's exactly what it is .
a group of males will grab a female , hold her down , and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis into her corkscrew-shaped vagina over and over and over again .
from flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second .
it 's a very simple genetically inherited trait and the males are not otherwise any different .
those that have long penile appendages are not bigger or stronger or otherwise any different at all .
`` well , according to the biological literature , `` '' during copulation , the genitalia of certain males may elicit more favorable female responses through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction with the female reproductive tract . '' '' mm-hm . ''
it 's very common in many phyla , from invertebrates to avian species , mammals , and , of course , even in primates .
now interestingly , there are a few mammalian species in which females have evolved specialized genitalia that does n't allow for sexual coercion to take place .
so it may not be surprising to any of you that animals , including ourselves , spend a good amount of time thinking about sex , but what might surprise you is the extent to which so many other aspects of their lives and our lives are influenced by it .
( applause )
and so here you 're seeing the operation of this wrist .
nowadays , in addressing microbial biodiversity , scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the pacific ocean .
i wish this were different . we really need it now .
and by definition , every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul , a global citizen .
on the one hand , we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out .
and on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid .
that when it comes to the rich , we 'll bail out and we 'll hand a lot of aid , but when it comes to our poor brethren , we want little to do with it .
and the problem is that neither side is listening to the other .
after 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation , it 's true that there are probably no more market-oriented individuals on the planet than low-income people .
patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk , a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment , to use the market as the best listening device that we have , and the expectation of below-market returns , but outsized social impact .
second , the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure — no roads to speak of , sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption .
it also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance .
they were creating subsidies either for large farms , or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use , rather than that the farmers wanted to use .
at the same time amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in israel .
it was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant .
and it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green .
second , it had to be extremely affordable .
what i mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre , the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth .
and we helped him build a company , for profit , that would build on ide 's knowledge , and start looking at sales and exports , and be able to tap into other kinds of capital .
and so we met dr. sono khangharani in pakistan .
so that in the terrorist attacks of november they were the first responder , and are now beginning to scale , because of partnership .
this idea of scale is critical .
because we 're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people . all of the ones i discussed have reached at least a quarter million people .
and it 's where the idea of partnership becomes so important .
president obama understands that .
and i would submit that it 's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations , not only for their country , but ones that we can use in the developed world as well .
we 've had a rocky relationship with that country and , in all fairness , the united states has not always been a very reliable partner .
but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen .
and as we think about how we construct aid for pakistan , while we need to strengthen the judiciary , build greater stability , we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world .
it was about 115 degrees .
and we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color , lots of heat , very little discussion , because we were exhausted .
and as we got closer , its significance became apparent .
his name was raja , and he had kind , twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father .
because he was building these crops .
and what 's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity .
because that is where dignity really starts .
our generation has seen both approaches tried , and often fail .
but i think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power .
for that is what we 'll need , as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us , and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet .
i can only talk from my own experience , but in eight years of running acumen fund , i 've seen the power of patient capital .
i know it works .
sp : but is this necessarily a bad thing ?
look , you 're trying to persuade us of reason 's impotence .
you 're not threatening us or bribing us , suggesting that we resolve the issue with a show of hands or a beauty contest .
after all , you pointed out that reason is just a means to an end , and the end depends on the reasoner 's passions .
reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony if the reasoner wants peace and harmony , but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife .
can reason force the reasoner to want less cruelty and waste ?
rng : all on its own , the answer is no , but it does n't take much to switch it to yes .
that 's one of the passions that has to be present in order for reason to go to work , and it 's obviously present in all of us .
in particular , can it explain a momentous historical development that i spoke about five years ago here at ted ?
namely , we seem to be getting more humane .
rng : so , do you think it 's human nature that 's changed ?
rng : can hard-headed scientists really give so much credit to soft-hearted empathy ?
they demonstrated that the way people treated some particular group of others was logically inconsistent with the way they insisted on being treated themselves .
one man 's prize is derived from the plunder of another .
the cause of rejoicings made by one side is to the other a cause of mourning .
whatever is unfortunate in war , is severely so indeed , and whatever , on the contrary , is called good fortune , is a savage and a cruel good fortune , an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another 's woe .
he argued that it was inconsistent with the principles of rational government .
one movement for the expansion of rights inspires another because the logic is the same , and once that 's hammered home , it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to ignore the inconsistency .
but this practice produces not pain of any kind to anyone .
and studies show that americans say that most do n't know a muslim .
i guess people do n't talk to their uber drivers .
i 'm an introvert .
i 'm a wannabe fitness fanatic .
but not like lady gaga says , because baby , i was n't born this way .
it was a choice .
its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears .
i see myself in it . i feel that god knows me .
have you ever felt like someone sees you , completely understands you and yet loves you anyway ?
that 's how it feels .
and then that terrible morning of september , 2001 .
now , some will still argue islam is a violent religion .
it 's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture .
but how does it impact ordinary americans ?
muslims are like canaries in the coal mine .
( applause ) and assigning collective guilt is n't just about having to explain yourself all the time .
what will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry ?
dalia mogahed : i would say , do n't let this stage distract you , i 'm completely ordinary .
my story is not unusual .
so the idea of electronic books is starting to come about .
but how do you go about doing all this scanning ?
if we can have mars rovers , you 'd think you could turn pages .
so how much is there ?
and we 've got , now , a lot of these materials .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
but i also grew up in a time where there was something to fear .
we created the space program in response to that .
we created the internet in response to that .
so sometimes fear can produce a constructive response .
on september 11 , 2001 , 19 guys took over four airplanes and flew them into a couple of buildings .
they posed an existential threat to no one .
they would have a small computer connected to the internet in their pocket .
and the weapon was the ipad .
but we 're not .
it 's china , india , russia .
we are seeing these changes everywhere we look .
these are fundamental issues . where are the philosophers ?
it 's better than prozac , but i would n't recommend it .
and they are going to have poor reading skills .
and we 've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today .
we also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives .
i always dreamt of the fifth one .
he would scream . he would beat me .
on one day , one night in that cellar , i do n't know what it was , i heard a child crying above my head , a boy , maybe two or three years old .
i talked to him about my daughters .
he was young , he was shy .
we have a responsibility to try .
this is inexcusable .
we must end this cycle of impunity .
i do n't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me .
why them ?
and if you want to change the world , we need more of them .
latin america has nine percent of the world 's population , but 25 percent of its global violent deaths .
there are certainly many more , but these are the ones that stand out to me .
we 've been more successful in the case of drug policy .
but today , the international drug control regime is starting to crumble .
in one highly viewed episode , a soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet .
thank you .
and to do that , they need a western education .
what 's driving it , and what can we do about it ?
we created public health care .
we created unions .
we need a new new deal .
now , i love penguin documentaries , but that was n't the news of the day .
nowadays , a network of tweets can unleash a global awareness campaign .
now , i believe so .
`` `` '' five minutes , '' '' he said . five minutes . ''
and he had no training or background in logistics .
or think of the occupy movement which rocked the world in 2011 .
in contrast , three years after occupy sparked that global conversation about inequality , the policies that fueled it are still in place .
and if you 're in power , you realize you have to take the capacity signaled by that march , not just the march , but the capacity signaled by that march , seriously .
he said the key is he never took sugar with his tea .
they have a point .
we need movements to be more effective .
so they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
and these decisions affect africa .
so one of their projects will be to help their own human community .
she was in the leadership in dar es salaam .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them ; the other half are n't there yet .
at the next regularly scheduled election , pepe lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform , but reconciliation as well .
he asked octavio to be his chief of staff .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk .
`` the leader of the congress came up on stage and said , `` '' professor romer , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could watch the tedtalk . ''
because the leaders in the government there in honduras would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement , so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced .
in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one .
to be part of the constitution , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress .
they 've got a site ; they 're already thinking about this site for the second city .
they 're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in , and also an external legal system .
one country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there .
and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you , ted .
( applause )
i just did something i 've never done before .
they 're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff .
so contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we did n't have to worry about it , this disaster is still unfolding .
rachel carson — the godmother of modern environmentalism — warned us about this very thing back in 1962 .
as with bp , the hole does get plugged , at least temporarily , but not before exacting a tremendous price .
for perfect scientific certainty .
`` a range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now , like `` '' greed . '' '' this is a popular explanation , and there 's lots of truth to it , because taking big risks , as we all know , pays a lot of money . ''
and greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness .
`` and this problem — call it the `` '' perils of privilege '' '' — brings us closer , i think , to the root of our collective recklessness . ''
because none of us — at least in the global north — neither men nor women , are fully exempt from this message .
`` it 's for motorola 's new rugged cell phone , and yes , it really does say , `` slap mother nature in the face . '' ''
i 'm showing it because — they 're not a sponsor , are they ? — because , in its own way , this is a crass version of our founding story .
we slapped mother nature around and won , and we always win , because dominating nature is our destiny .
but this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature .
it is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do .
they were just beyond our sights .
i believe that we know this , yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop .
`` now on the one hand , exhorting us to `` '' drill , baby , drill , '' '' because god put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them , and on the other , glorying in the wilderness of alaska 's untouched beauty on her hit reality tv show . ''
in environmental circles , we often hear that , rather than shifting to renewables , we are continuing with business as usual .
so that means drilling for oil in the deepest water , including the icy arctic seas , where a clean-up may simply be impossible .
it means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip-mining operations for coal , the likes of which we have n't yet seen .
and most controversially , it means the tar sands .
you ca n't just drill a hole and pump it out .
tar sand 's oil is solid , mixed in with the soil .
that 's a person down there by the wheel .
vast , vivid landscapes are being gutted , left monochromatic gray .
just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet , off the power of sun , wind and waves , we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest , highest-emitting stuff imaginable .
this is where our story of endless growth has taken us , to this black hole at the center of my country — a place of such planetary pain that , like the bp gusher , one can only stand to look at it for so long .
at the very last minute , we are going to get saved just like in every hollywood movie , just like in the rapture .
think of it as the ultimate junk shot .
most importantly , we do n't have to change our lifestyles after all .
for other people , it 's a guy with a garden hose .
( applause )
i am a plant geneticist .
first , let me introduce my husband , raoul .
on his farm , he plants a variety of different crops .
would this work in the field ?
you can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center .
the conventional papaya around the outside is severely infected with the virus .
chris anderson : powerfully argued .

so when it comes to the human brain — my colleague jonas frisén from the karolinska institutet , has estimated that we produce 700 new neurons per day in the hippocampus .
and we are now going to do a little quiz .
yes .
yes , stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus .
how about sex ?
i will let you judge that one by yourself .
and now , you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage .
ethanol — intake of alcohol — will decrease neurogenesis .
we also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of robert 's patients .
mh : i 'm really interested in the running thing .
do i have to run ?
st : thank you , margaret .
sheryl shade : hi , aimee . aimee mullins : hi .
ss : so , then aimee makes it to the 1996 paralympics , and she 's all excited . her family 's coming down — it 's a big deal .
it 's now two years that you 've been running ?
am : okay , well , atlanta .
it was , like , this is my time for shine .
and we 're at the trainee warm-up track , which is a few blocks away from the olympic stadium .
it 's my first international meet .
and georgetown — that was great .
all this training — i had transformed my life .
and it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there .
how many people gave of their time and their expertise , and their patience , to deal with me ?
that 's the achievement , i think . that 's the real achievement .
ss : you know , show us more than one set of legs .
and , seriously , like , i can wear heels .
and then this is the silicon sheath i roll over , to keep it on . which , when i sweat , you know , i 'm pistoning out of it .
am : i do n't know . i do n't think so .
i may be a little taller . i actually can put both of them on .
but without having the silicon sock , i 'm just going to try slip in it .
and i was a guinea pig , as i hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out .
for me , while i 'm such a serious athlete on the track , i want to be feminine off the track , and i think it 's so important not to be limited in any capacity , whether it 's , you know , your mobility or even fashion .
i mean , i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want — the shoes i want , the skirts i want — and i 'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people .
it 's like a barbie foot under this .
ss : for 45 minutes . luckily , the hotel was terrific .
i study how the brain processes information . that is , how it takes information in from the outside world , and converts it into patterns of electrical activity , and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things — to see , hear , to reach for an object .
so i 'm really a basic scientist , not a clinician , but in the last year and a half i 've started to switch over , to use what we 've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices , and what i wanted to do today is show you an example of this .
so when you look at something , like this image of this baby 's face , it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina , on the front-end cells here , the photoreceptors .
`` like this pattern of pulses here actually means `` '' baby 's face , '' '' and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses , it knows that what was out there was a baby 's face , and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was , say , a dog , or another pattern would be a house . ''
and , of course , in real life , it 's all dynamic , meaning that it 's changing all the time , so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you 're looking at is changing all the time too .
they are n't getting any input , so the person 's brain no longer gets any visual information — that is , he or she is blind .
so it consists of two parts , what we call an encoder and a transducer .
so a completely blind retina , even one with no front-end circuitry at all , no photoreceptors , can now send out normal signals , signals that the brain can understand .
in other words , we 're not literally replacing the components of the retina .
we 've just abstracted what the retina 's doing with a set of equations .
now just to orient you , each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells , and just as in the previous slides , each row is a different cell , and i just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so i could show you a long stretch of data .
how important is this ?
so what about with our approach , adding the code ? and you can see that it 's much better . not only can you tell that it 's a baby 's face , but you can tell that it 's this baby 's face , which is a really challenging task .
but there was this limiting factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal responses , and so this was our contribution .
and then the last thing i wanted to say , really , is to emphasize that the idea generalizes .
so the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas , for example , the auditory system and the motor system , so for treating deafness and for motor disorders .
( applause )
and this is the cause for 80 percent of the diseases in rural areas .
in india , it is unfortunately only the women who carry water .
i do n't know if we indians can be proud of such a distinction .
so we are speaking about transformation , transformation in rural areas .
and when it is full , it is blocked and it can go to the next .
if any of you come to my place , i would be happy to share these bananas and papayas with you .
this is how an elevated water reservoir is constructed .
and boys , about 30 percent .
so this is a democracy in action because there is a general body , a governing board , the committee .
so i discovered some very interesting things .
in the 17th century , a doodle was a simpleton or a fool — as in yankee doodle .
doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work ; it 's totally inappropriate .
and additionally , there is a psychological aversion to doodling — thank you , freud .
now it turned out to be bill gates ' doodle .
and i 'm not comfortable with that .
here 's the real definition : doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think .
that is why millions of people doodle .
and i think that is incredible .
this is but one : this is frank gehry the architect 's precursor to the guggenheim in abu dhabi .
this is essential for our own brains , and it 's also pretty useful on a computer .
the first person who , i think , really developed some kind of insight into what was going on in the brain was the great spanish neuroanatomist , santiago ramón y cajal , in the 19th century , who used microscopy and special stains that could selectively fill in or render in very high contrast the individual cells in the brain , in order to start to understand their morphologies .
they 're reminiscent , of course , of wires .
but in many ways , these microanatomical drawings of ramón y cajal 's , like this one , they 're still in some ways unsurpassed .
the structures you see are mitochondria that are the size of bacteria .
warren mcculloch and walter pitts looked at ramón y cajal 's drawing of visual cortex , which i 'm showing here .
so the pixels you can think about as a first layer of neurons , and that 's , in fact , how it works in the eye — that 's the neurons in the retina .
`` `` '' bird '' '' is only four letters , right ? ''
i 'll show you an artificial neural network that we 've built recently , doing exactly that .
so in that picture , the x and the w are known , and the y is the unknown .
this is a very , very complicated , very non-linear operation ; it has no inverse .
you just say , let 's play a little algebra trick , and move the six over to the right-hand side of the equation .
so you 've taken an initial guess : what if w = 0 ?
typically , it never quite gets there , but after about a dozen steps , we 're up to w = 2.999 , which is close enough .
so now , we 've held x and w fixed to solve for y ; that 's everyday , fast perception .
it turns out that by using exactly the same error-minimization procedure , one can do that with the network trained to recognize birds , and the result turns out to be ...
a picture of birds .
here he and alex together have tried reducing the y 's to a space of only two dimensions , thereby making a map out of the space of all things recognized by this network .
so you can see it 's not perfect .
but you start to get something more like a coherent face , rendered using my own face as a guide .
here we 're starting with just a picture of clouds , and as we optimize , basically , this network is figuring out what it sees in the clouds .
( laughter ) or , mike has done some other experiments in which he takes that cloud image , hallucinates , zooms , hallucinates , zooms hallucinates , zooms .
and that ought to be unsurprising ; the brain is computational .
thank you very much .
i was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be .
and when i came home , i found the scope of my existence gradually diminishing until loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge .
and we still possess the fear and the courage and the aggression required to navigate those times .
to conquer uncertainty , to know what comes next , that 's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies , and having got there , or almost got there , we have just encountered a new set of unmet needs .
i do n't find that a useful or even intelligible concept .
and it was only when i stumbled across an unfamiliar word that i began to understand what i was looking for .
one of the most exciting scientific findings of the past half century has been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades .
a trophic cascade is an ecological process which starts at the top of the food chain and tumbles all the way down to the bottom , and the classic example is what happened in the yellowstone national park in the united states when wolves were reintroduced in 1995 .
in some areas , the height of the trees quintupled in just six years .
the number of beavers started to increase , because beavers like to eat the trees .
ravens and bald eagles came down to feed on the carrion that the wolves had left .
they began to meander less .
`` one of the many post-rational excuses made by the japanese government for killing whales is that they said , `` '' well , the number of fish and krill will rise and then there 'll be more for people to eat . '' '' well , it 's a stupid excuse , but it sort of kind of makes sense , does n't it , because you 'd think that whales eat huge amounts of fish and krill , so obviously take the whales away , there 'll be more fish and krill . ''
you take the whales away , and the number of krill collapses .
and interestingly , well , we know that plant plankton in the oceans absorb carbon from the atmosphere — the more plant plankton there are , the more carbon they absorb — and eventually they filter down into the abyss and remove that carbon from the atmospheric system .
you begin to see that possibly , the evidence supporting james lovelock 's gaia hypothesis , which conceives of the world as a coherent , self-regulating organism , is beginning , at the ecosystem level , to accumulate .
and they make , in my view , a powerful case for the reintroduction of missing species .
rewilding , to me , means bringing back some of the missing plants and animals .
it has no view as to what a right ecosystem or a right assemblage of species looks like .
there 's another one which suggests that 30 million hectares of land in europe , an area the size of poland , will be vacated by farmers between 2000 and 2030 .
now , faced with opportunities like that , does it not seem a little unambitious to be thinking only of bringing back wolves , lynx , bears , beavers , bison , boar , moose , and all the other species which are already beginning to move quite rapidly across europe ?
yes , ladies and gentlemen , there were lions in trafalgar square long before nelson 's column was built .
it 's pressure from the human population hunting and destroying their habitats which has done so .
and even so , you can still see the shadows of these great beasts in our current ecosystems .
why is it that so many deciduous trees are able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken ?
in europe , for example , they evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant , elephas antiquus , which was a great beast .
it was related to the asian elephant , but it was a temperate animal , a temperate forest creature .
and perhaps this is the most important thing that rewilding offers us , the most important thing that 's missing from our lives : hope .
and the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward .
`` it 's called `` '' the apples of new york '' '' and this is the second volume . ''
see , we used to have a lot of apples .
in the future , later this century , it 's going to look like the red , totally out of bounds .
we will watch children starve to death on tv .
in rwanda , in the solomon islands .
it 's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane .
it 's otherworldly , beautiful .
i think of it as sort of a cathedral .
giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
fish swim backwards by wagging their heads .
we fear the worst .
in our minds , fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads and we do n't even notice them .
i 'm going to tell you five facts about myself .
two : i currently run a construction company in orlando .
( applause ) at this point , most people really only care about the television show .
it 's about my vision .
what does it feel like to see ?
well , that 's what i thought .
objects appeared , morphed and disappeared in my reality .
i pieced together fragmented , transitory images , consciously analyzed the clues , searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope , until i saw nothing at all .
what we see is a unique , personal , virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our brain .
let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience .
it 's no surprise then that the illusion of sight is so compelling .
to create the experience of sight , your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world , other knowledge , your memories , opinions , emotions , mental attention .
so for example , what you see impacts how you feel , and the way you feel can literally change what you see .
if you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video , for example , your answer will be different if you 're told to think about cheetahs or turtles .
let 's take fear as just one example .
your fears distort your reality .
when you face a compelling opportunity to take action , fear lulls you into inaction , enticing you to passively watch its prophecies fulfill themselves .
blindness was a death sentence for my independence .
it can be taught . it can be practiced .
correct your misconceptions about luck and about success .
accept your strengths and your weaknesses , and understand the difference .
choose to see through them .
what do you fear ?
helen keller said that the only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision .
what kind of specific challenges do you have , and how do you overcome them ?
i do n't get visual feedback from people .
so , for example , in my leadership team meetings , i do n't see facial expressions or gestures .
sj : and that 's me over there , taking photos the whole way .
i 'll give you an example .
and this is what mindfulness is all about : seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors , becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance , naturally letting go .
this is n't to say that , poof , magically we quit smoking .
so it actually works .
now , one current hypothesis is that a region of this network , called the posterior cingulate cortex , is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it , when we get sucked in , and it takes us for a ride .
`` the first dog is the first to go , and he is contemplating an aspect of his relationship to his owner , and the title is `` '' a dog on his master . '' '' `` `` as young as i look , i am growing older faster than he . ''
seven to one is the ratio , they tend to say .
i admit the sight of the leash would excite me , but only because it meant i was about to smell things you had never touched .
while you slept , i watched you breathe as the moon rose in the sky .
( applause )
upon first arriving there , the first goal that i had was for me to identify an apartment , so i could bring my wife and my new baby , melanie , out to join me in idaho .
just come on down , select the apartment that you want .
his name was mcdow , major mcdow .
why do n't you let your family stay home , because you do know that you get a 30-day leave .
there 's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer .
it did n't have a laundry facility .
four years after that , i received papers to move from mountain home , idaho to a place called goose bay , labrador .
she kind of looked at them . no one said anything .
so i just got the hint and i left , and went outside to the parking lot .
i jumped on a plane and shot off to goose bay , labrador , which is another story , right ?
i have master 's , ph.d. , undergrad , one in medical school .
how do i keep them safe ? how do i keep them alive ?
the only way i think we can do that is through a collective .
we 're here to celebrate compassion .
`` karen armstrong has told what i think is an iconic story of giving a speech in holland and , after the fact , the word `` '' compassion '' '' was translated as `` '' pity . '' '' now compassion , when it enters the news , too often comes in the form of feel-good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self-sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time . ''
`` now the word `` '' tolerance , '' '' if you look at it in the dictionary , connotes `` '' allowing , '' '' `` '' indulging '' '' and `` '' enduring . '' '' in the medical context that it comes from , it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment . ''
tolerance is not really a lived virtue ; it 's more of a cerebral ascent .
so what is it , three-dimensionally ?
what are its kindred and component parts ?
`` they are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young jews and muslims , and as they do that , they cultivate what they call `` curiosity without assumptions . '' ''
well that 's going to be a breeding ground for compassion .
compassion can be synonymous with empathy .
it can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation , but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence .
it 's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there , just showing up .
and compassion does seek physicality .
he 's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13 , in a car crash that killed his father and his sister .
he 's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from iraq and afghanistan .
the communities that jean vanier founded , like jean vanier himself , exude tenderness .
we spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive , and i spend a lot of time being those things too .
compassion is rarely a solution , but it is always a sign of a deeper reality , of deeper human possibilities .
it lodged as shards inside every aspect of the creation .
and that the highest human calling is to look for this light , to point at it when we see it , to gather it up , and in so doing , to repair the world .
rachel naomi remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors .
we all know about the albert einstein who came up with e = mc2 .
we do n't hear so much about the einstein who invited the african american opera singer , marian anderson , to stay in his home when she came to sing in princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and would n't have her .
some of his favorites were moses , jesus , buddha , st. francis of assisi , gandhi — he adored his contemporary , gandhi .
`` i want to show you the rest of this photograph , because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word `` '' compassion '' '' in our culture — we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life , which is messy . ''
so was mother teresa .
but what a liberating thing to realize that our problems , in fact , are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion , towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others .
rachel naomi remen is a better doctor because of her life-long struggle with crohn 's disease .
einstein became a humanitarian , not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter , but because he was a jew as germany grew fascist .
now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this , and we need them to mine it for us now .
so i will paraphrase einstein in closing and say that humanity , the future of humanity , needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race .
we know now that that is not the case because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces .
`` in both cases , `` '' whatever it takes '' '' meant trillions of dollars more in money-printing policies that continue today . ''
and it 's truly global .
so those extra reserves that were printed in 2009 , in the end , for developed market countries at least , were n't really needed .
and they remain unused today .
printing international money in this way has several advantages over printing national currencies .
`` we must , must , must do `` '' whatever it takes . '' '' thank you . ''
i 'd like to talk about what i call our warehouses for hope .
sami osmakac is n't alone .
but there is also a lot that i can do .
i lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident .
and this is gdp per capita on this axis .
and they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday .
we have to look over generations to understand it .
and this is my family .
this is 1962 , and united states was emitting 16 tons per person .
this is two to five dollars . you have a bed .
we had been collecting data for six years .
so why this temperature jump ?
so donald goes into this slew of medications he was taking .
these laws treat people touched by hiv with compassion and acceptance .
and you did a very , very , very bad thing .
i took the test and the result showed i was positive .
and the trend ? well the trend is clear .
and as activists , we would take our polaroid camera , we would take her picture , we would wait 90 seconds , and we would give her the photograph .
and she would then have the evidence she needed to go to court .
and for all those years , i 've had an absolutely passionate and sometimes not popular belief that this violence is not inevitable , that it is learned , and if it 's learned , it can be un-learned , and it can be prevented .
because it 's true .
it is absolutely true .
i was probably 30 and naive .
the take the fun out of marriage act .
i 'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here .
and i also want to say one other thing : we are not going to solve this problem by building more jails or by even building more shelters .
it is about economic empowerment for women , it is about healing kids who are hurt , and it is about prevention with a capital p .
and so , step number three on this journey : we know , if we 're going to keep making this progress , we 're going to have to turn up the volume , we 're going to have to increase the visibility , and we 're going to have to engage the public .
man : you want to see what hurts ? ( slaps woman ) that 's what hurts ! that 's what hurts ! ( breaking glass ) woman : help me !
we learned that he had a long history of domestic violence .
and let me just put this in context .
before 1980 , do you have any idea how many articles were in the new york times on domestic violence ?
we were obviously making a difference .
they do talk to their kids .
`` they talk to their kids as parents , as coaches . '' '' and that 's what we did . ''
we met men where they were at and we built a program .
`` and all of a sudden , he looked at the back of the room , and he saw his daughter , and he called out his daughter 's name , michaela , and he said , `` '' michaela , come up here . '' '' and she 's nine years old , and she was kind of shy , and she got up there , and he said , `` '' sit down next to me . '' '' she sat right down next to him . ''
`` i do this work because i 'm her dad , and i do n't want anyone ever to hurt her . '' '' and as a parent , i get it . ''
technology has been our friend .
i believe we can bend the arc of human history toward compassion and equality , and i also fundamentally believe and passionately believe that this violence does not have to be part of the human condition .
but i did n't know how .
it was a summer day in 1941 .
the circus had just arrived in the tiny town of brookfield , new york .
something had gone wrong with the lion tamer .
the strongman had given the lion tamer mouth-to-mouth , and saved his life .
but that all happened later .
later , he 'd even go on to help develop the epidural , for delivering mothers .
he was only 27 .
`` the most important thing from the patient 's perspective , they do n't talk about . '' '' so over the next eight years , bonica would talk about it . ''
the goal was n't to make patients better ; it was to make patients feel better .
but as they did — a tragic twist .
but now they were like him : retired .
and it made it impossible for him to ignore in others .
but as i saw bonica 's pain — a testament to his fully lived life — i started to remember all the things that my mom 's pain holds .
it 's a story about this woman , natalia rybczynski .
but it was challenging .
ln : so what animal could it be ?
so how on earth would one of these guys end up in the high arctic ?
i gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise .
so over the long course of human history , the infectious disease that 's killed more humans than any other is malaria .
it 's carried in the bites of infected mosquitos , and it 's probably our oldest scourge .
this is a question that 's personally intrigued me for a long time .
and i really hated the mosquitos for that .
but at the same time , i come from a jain family , and jainism is a religion that espouses a very extreme form of nonviolence .
we 're not supposed to walk on grass , because you could , you know , inadvertently kill some insects when you walk on grass .
it lives half its life inside the cold-blooded mosquito and half its life inside the warm-blooded human .
it 's a shape-shifter , for one thing .
so the parasite is a very big scientific challenge to tackle , but so is the mosquito that carries the parasite .
only about 12 species of mosquitos carry most of the world 's malaria , and we know quite a bit about the kinds of watery habitats that they specialize in .
so you might think , then , well , why do n't we just avoid the places where the killer mosquitos live ? right ?
so it 's not easy for us to extricate ourselves from these insects .
we kind of create places that they love to live just by living our own lives .
if you 're poor , you 're more likely to get malaria .
so poverty causes malaria , but what we also know now is that malaria itself causes poverty .
everything else stays the same , so we still have bad food , bad water , bad sanitation , all the things that make people sick .
but just if you take malaria out , deaths from everything else go down .
what it means is , if you have malaria in your society , your economic growth is depressed by 1.3 percent every year , year after year after year , just this one disease alone .
but along with the scientific challenge and the economic challenge , there 's also a cultural challenge , and this is probably the part about malaria that people do n't like to talk about .
like , why would you write about something so boring , so ordinary ? you know ?
and it 's simple risk perception , really .
so i think people in malarious parts of the world must think of malaria the way those of us who live in the temperate world think of cold and flu . right ?
and that adds up to the biggest problem of all , which , of course , is the political problem .
most malarious societies throughout history have simply lived with the disease .
it was the brainchild of the u.s. state department .
they knew they had to focus on cheap , easy-to-use tools , and they focused on ddt .
in fact , their rather patronizing view was that people at risk of malaria should n't be asked to do anything at all .
they had so much faith in their tools that they stopped doing malaria research .
`` one who official at the time actually called that whole campaign `` one of the greatest mistakes ever made in public health . '' ''
the latest effort to tame malaria started in the late 1990s .
they are doing tons of malaria research .
they 're focusing on very cheap , very easy-to-use tools .
it 's treated with insecticides .
and when you think about the bed net , it 's sort of a surgical intervention .
now that 's no big deal if you 're fighting a killer disease .
i mean , these are minor inconveniences .
and that 's what happening now .
but it takes time . it takes money .
it takes all the things that that cheap , easy-to-use bed net was not supposed to be .
now attacking the malarious way of life , this is something — these are things people care about today .
( applause )
so we thought about this and we said , it 's kind of obvious , right ?
it does n't apply the brakes for you , it does n't do anything goofy , but it also does n't get you out of an accident .
and so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system .
knowing that one pickup truck is great , but we really need to know what everybody 's thinking , so it becomes quite a complicated problem .
and of course , if anyone 's breaking the rules , the police are there and the car has to understand that that flashing light on the top of the car means that it 's not just a car , it 's actually a police officer .
and when a police officer stood in the road , our vehicle should understand that this means stop , and when they signal to go , we should continue .
so here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us .
here there 's a cyclist coming down the road and we know they 're going to continue to drive down the shape of the road .
and similarly , here , a cyclist blowing through that light as well .
on this debate between driver-assisted and fully driverless — i mean , there 's a real debate going on out there right now .
i believe that the greatest failure of the human race is the fact that we 've left more than one billion of our members behind .
when i first moved to rural east africa , i stayed overnight with a farm family .
and when farmers become more productive , they reduce environmental pressure .
first , hybrid seed is created when you cross two seeds together .
so overall , this is amazing news .
if america can deliver pizza to an area of this size , then africa 's companies , governments and non-profits can deliver farm services to all of her farmers .
this is possible .
again , using a map of the united states for scale , this is what i would call a highly achievable delivery zone .
but we also need a lot of support roles .
humanity has put people on the moon .
we 've run marathons at a five-minute mile pace .
logistically speaking , it 's incredibly possible to end extreme poverty .
and we really , we really loved this machine .
it 's called the bureaucratic administrative machine .
in order to have that machine running , you need lots and lots of people .
they 're there in thousands in every office .
and you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs .
how is present-day schooling going to prepare them for that world ?
and right next to where i used to work , there was a slum .
and i used to think , how on earth are those kids ever going to learn to write computer programs ?
and he 's teaching her how to browse .
i 'd seen it happen over and over and over again .
i put in hole in the wall computers there , downloaded all kinds of stuff from the internet about dna replication , most of which i did n't understand .
so i left them for a couple of months .
how do i get them to pass ? i have to get them 20 more marks .
( children speaking ) neurons ... communication .
so what are jobs going to be like ?
what will it be tomorrow ?
could it be that we do n't need to go to school at all ?
encouragement seems to be the key .
`` if you look at kuppam , if you look at all of the experiments that i did , it was simply saying , `` '' wow , '' '' saluting learning . ''
there is evidence from neuroscience .
but the age of empires is gone .
we need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure .
the granny cloud sits on the internet .
i 've seen them do it from a village called diggles in northwestern england , deep inside a village in tamil nadu , india , 6,000 miles away .
well , i intend to build these self-organized learning environments .
i 've tried this in many , many schools .
`` i 've tried incredible , incredible questions — `` '' when did the world begin ? how will it end ? '' '' — to nine-year-olds . ''
my wish is that we design the future of learning .
we do n't want to be spare parts for a great human computer , do we ?
it will be a school where children go on these intellectual adventures driven by the big questions which their mediators put in .
there 's only one granny who manages health and safety .
`` i do n't know , what should i do ? '' '' and i was trying to take a picture of her quietly . ''
( laughter ) ( applause ) i think it was good advice .
i 'll follow her advice . i 'll stop talking .
the most important thing is passion .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
economic growth matters .
economic growth matters powerfully for the individual .
arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it 's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of china .
ultimately , we have to recognize that ideology is the enemy of growth .
is that what you 're suggesting ?
do n't think they are making small talk .
the chinese zodiac is different .
we even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations .
as a pig , i need to be careful with a snake .
raise your hand if you are a snake .
according to the bbc and the chinese government 's press release , january 2015 saw a peak of cesarean sections .
that was the last month for the year of the horse .
i went through the forbes top 300 richest people in the world , and it 's interesting to see the most undesirable two animals , the goat and tiger , are at the top of the chart , even higher than the dragon .
you may not realize this , but there are more bacteria in your body than stars in our entire galaxy .
and like writing software , we can print and write dna into different algorithms and programs inside of bacteria .
the growing colony of bacteria that you see here is about the width of a human hair .
altogether , imagine in the future taking a programmed probiotic that could detect and treat cancer , or even other diseases .
it 's been fantastic .
now , of course , not all deception hits the news .
let 's take a look at winnipeg . how many of you , in the last 24 hours — think back — have told a little fib , or a big one ? how many have told a little lie out there ?
make sure you pay attention to them . ( laughter ) no , that looked good , it was about two thirds of you .
does anybody know what he was looking for ?
they 're called the butler , the sock puppet and the chinese water army .
then you 've also lied . ( laughter ) we 're never on our way . we 're thinking about going on our way .
`` my battery was dead . '' '' your battery was n't dead . ''
you were n't in a dead zone .
our relationship is still important .
let me give you a very recent example , as in , like , last week .
here 's r.j. ellory , best-seller author in britain .
here 's one of his bestselling books .
now this sock puppet stuff is n't actually that new .
i can assure you there 's deception there .
let 's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones .
here 's a couple of studies . one of the studies we do are called diary studies , in which we ask people to record all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days , and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium , and the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media .
and it really throws people for a loop because we think , well , there 's no nonverbal cues , so why do n't you lie more ?
this tends to be very different from what people expect .
then they had strangers , many strangers , judge the person 's personality just from facebook , and what they found was those judgments of the personality were pretty much identical , highly correlated , meaning that facebook profiles really do reflect our actual personality .
i mean , that 's a pretty deceptive space .
that diagonal line is the truth line . if their dot 's on it , they were telling exactly the truth .
what it means is all the guys were lying about their height .
`` in fact , they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch , what we say in the lab as `` '' strong rounding up . '' '' ( laughter ) you get to 5'8 '' '' and one tenth , and boom ! 5'9 '' '' . ''
one of the reasons is pretty simple . if you go to a date , a coffee date , and you 're completely different than what you said , game over . right ? so people lied frequently , but they lied subtly , not too much . they were constrained .
that really is strange . how do we explain this ?
and you 're not alone . around the world , almost every culture , one of the top cues is eyes . but the research over the last 50 years says there 's actually no reliable cue to deception , which blew me away , and it 's one of the hard lessons that i learned when i was customs officer .
but i think there 's actually something much more interesting and fundamental going on here . the next big thing for me , the next big idea , we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language .
anybody do any writing today ? did anybody write a word ?
in this room , right now , we 've probably recorded more than almost all of human pre-ancient history .
i can look at lies that before were said and then gone .
the other review is real . the person stayed there .
and how many of you think that b is ?
let me highlight a couple of things here in the fake review . the first is that liars tend to think about narrative . they make up a story : who ? and what happened ? and that 's what happened here .
they were inserting themselves into the hotel review , kind of trying to convince you they were there .
we believe that every lie now , every type of lie — fake hotel reviews , fake shoe reviews , your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging — those are all different lies . they 're going to have different patterns of language . but because everything 's recorded now , we can look at all of those kinds of lies .
my outbox for email is massive , and i never look at it . i write all the time , but i never look at my record , at my trace .
not only are you leaving a record for yourself on your machine , but you 're leaving a record on the person that you were lying to , and you 're also leaving them around for me to analyze with some computer algorithms .
so by all means , go ahead and do that , that 's good .
because in the digital age we live in now , in the networked age , we are all leaving a record .
you can experience their sense of place .
and what was surprising to me was how quickly my relationship to the physical world had changed .
if you went and looked for images of the internet , this was all that you found , this famous image by opte of the internet as the kind of milky way , this infinite expanse where we do n't seem to be anywhere on it .
a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet . ( laughter ) and then i got this image in my head of what would happen if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started to follow it . where would it go ?
`` the elders of the internet were willing to part with it for a short while , and she looks at it and she says , `` this is the internet ? the whole internet ? is it heavy ? '' ''
`` they say , `` '' of course not , the internet does n't weigh anything . '' '' and i was embarrassed . i was looking for this thing that only fools seem to look for . ''
the internet was that amorphous blob , or it was a silly black box with a blinking red light on it .
it was n't a real world out there .
and that connection is an unequivocally physical process .
a building like 60 hudson , and a dozen or so others , has 10 times more networks connecting within it than the next tier of buildings .
there 's a very short list of these places .
if the internet is a global phenomenon , if we live in a global village , it 's because there are cables underneath the ocean , cables like this .
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started thinking about this , there was one cable down the western coast of africa , represented in this map by steve song as that thin black line .
and i 've never met him . we 've only communicated via this telepresence system , which always makes me think of him as the man inside the internet . ( laughter ) and he is english . the undersea cable industry is dominated by englishmen , and they all seem to be 42 .
he thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness .
and first they got it with a hacksaw , and then they start sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a — sort of working like chefs , and then finally they 're working like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up with the cable that had come down , and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together .
it starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing .
and what surprised me as well was that as much as this is based on the most sophisticated technology , as much as this is an incredibly new thing , the physical process itself has been around for a long time , and the culture is the same .
you see the local laborers . you see the english engineer giving directions in the background . and more importantly , the places are the same . these cables still connect these classic port cities , places like lisbon , mombasa , mumbai , singapore , new york .
we are less connected to it . we let other people worry about it .
and that does n't seem right .
thank you . ( applause ) ( applause ) thanks . ( applause )
well , according to the governments of the world , yes we can .
and this is why that’s not entirely a good thing : because over the age of 65 , your risk of getting alzheimer’s or parkinson’s disease will increase exponentially .
but you can see that it 's extremely faint .
it 's like , well , you can try that , but the problem is timing .
so think about this , right ?
you think ted is hard to organize . ( laughter ) right ?
it 's breathable . it creates color through structure .
nature is nano .
swarm technology . there is a company called regen .
my name is kate hartman .
( laughter ) so just to give you a bit of context , as june said , i 'm an artist , a technologist and an educator .
and much of what i do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form .
and it 's pretty simple .
and so it all started several years ago , late one night when i was sitting on the subway , riding home , and i was thinking .
this one is called the talk to yourself hat .
and when you speak out loud , the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears .
( laughter ) and so when i make these things , it 's really not so much about the object itself , but rather the negative space around the object .
( laughter ) and so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication .
so they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions .
and so glaciers are these magnificent beings , and there 's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them , but what i 'm particularly interested in is in human-glacier relations .
and this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter .
or perhaps i need to make myself a speaking tool , like an icy megaphone that i can use to amplify my voice when i direct it at the ice .
so , yea , this is actually just the beginning .
so beyond that , in closing , i 'd just like to say that we 're in this era of communications and device proliferation , and it 's really tremendous and exciting and sexy , but i think what 's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world .
thanks .
( applause )
and we 're surrounded by natural light and organic elements .
your phone is not very natural .
a fork is a simple tool .
reality is richer than screens .
for example , i love books .
for me they are time machines — atoms and molecules bound in space , from the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience .
but there 's more than you can do with these magic boxes .
your phone is not the internet 's door bitch .
so let 's recap .
you may feel uncomfortable about the age of information that we 're moving into .
thank you very much .
all right , let 's head back to 1964 , and let 's hear where some of dylan 's early songs came from .
this is a sculpture i made , which is a way of , kind of , freeing a form into an object that has different degrees of freedom .
this is a bronze ball , an aluminum arm here , and then this wooden disk .
but if you put something on top of it , it disbalances it . and so it would tip over .
but in this case because the interior is free-swinging in relation to the sphere , it can stand up on one point .
this is sculpture that i made that — it 's magnetically levitated .
but it 's uh — let 's see if i can manipulate it a little bit without , um — oops .
it 's sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave .
and that 's what supports the object and keeps it stable .
i have a sort of a collection of videos that i took of different installations , which i could narrate .
this is a sculpture of the sun and the earth , in proportion .
and then in a series of 55 balls , it reduces , proportionately — each ball and the spaces between them reduce proportionately , until they get down to this little earth .
this is a little stone ball , floating .
this is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist .
i was thinking that the sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist . ( laughter ) so this , again , is on the subject — a slice from the equator of the earth .
and then the moon in the center , and it 's floating . and this is in france .
this is in sapporo .
but it 's being balanced like that in equilibrium .
this is another species of work that i do .
so all the red sides , for example , face one direction : south .
this is something i did of a tactile communication system .
this is a clock i designed .
so it 's a floating island with water , fresh water , that can fly from place to place .
this would be grown , i suppose , with nanotechnology in the future sometime .
this has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations .
the whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes , red , blue , and green , that allow you to have a high-resolution picture , visible in daylight .
i brought it to paul maccready 's company aerovironment to do a feasibility study , and they analyzed it , and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it .
so we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen .
the idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show .
it really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting .
there would be on board a crew of artists , musicians , that would allow the thing to become actually kind of a conscious object that would respond to the moment , and to interact as an entity that was aware , that could communicate .
it could be interacted with large crowds in different ways .
the default image on the object would probably be a high-resolution earth image .
but then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues , or migrations — all of the things that we 're concerned with today .
i asked a question last year : can art change the world ?
so there has been a lot of change .
so when i had my ted wish last year , i said , look , i 'm going to switch my concept .
this is inside out .
this one was from haiti .
when i launched my wish last year , hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us .
these are the people i want to talk about to you today .
and they pasted [ over ] every single portrait of the dictator [ with ] their own photos .
russia . chad wanted to fight against homophobia in russia .
karachi , pakistan .
she organized a tedx action out there and made all the unseen faces of the city on the walls in her town .
and i want to thank her today .
he pasted up portraits all over his reservation .
and he 's here also today .
thousands of people use them and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution and then walk in the street .
they were all holding their photo as a statement .
on the other side , people were wrapping up streets , buildings .
( applause )
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
these are pictures over about a six-second period .
it 's over 300 million molecular weight .
we now have techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesis , to do what we 're calling combinatorial genomics .
you know , we do n't know necessarily what it 'll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
sunlight and co2 is one method ...
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling-water temperatures .
but also , we 're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
you 've seen this year with flu ; we 're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages 16 to 19 in the united states — leading cause of death — and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol .
so what happens ?
no one can say for sure , but i remember my first accident .
i slammed on the brakes .
i just want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now .
you and everyone else . this is the safe way to drive .
why do we do this ? because we have to , we have to make a choice , do i look here or do i look here ?
and i believe that . i believe that .
we can only watch so much .
in the future , with cars exchanging data with each other , we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind , to the right and left , all at the same time , bird 's eye view , we will actually be able to see into those cars .
we will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us , to see how fast that guy 's going or stopping .
how can you predict the future ? that 's really hard .
cars are three-dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity .
often they travel on pre-published routes .
i mean , they 're newtonian objects .
we can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars , just sharing gps .
what happens if two cars share that data , if they talk to each other ?
everybody wins .
we also attach a discrete short-range communication radio , and the robots talk to each other .
if your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories , you do n't pay as much attention to those packets .
you prioritize the one guy who seems to be going a little off course .
so you do n't only know that he 's going off course , you know how .
so we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling .
but i believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy , just like right now , when i look at your car from the outside , i do n't really know about you .
i believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs .
it 's going to make the roads a lot safer .
this is how english my mother is — or was , she just passed .
i call a name that could be his .
it 's called crispr-cas9 .
and in a bacterium , the crispr system allows that dna to be plucked out of the virus , and inserted in little bits into the chromosome — the dna of the bacterium .
and these integrated bits of viral dna get inserted at a site called crispr .
crispr stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats .
rna is a chemical cousin of dna , and it allows interaction with dna molecules that have a matching sequence .
it searches through all of the dna in the cell , to find sites that match the sequences in the bound rnas .
and when those sites are found — as you can see here , the blue molecule is dna — this complex associates with that dna and allows the cas9 cleaver to cut up the viral dna .
genome engineering is actually not new , it 's been in development since the 1970s .
so once a double-stranded break is made in dna , we can induce repair , and thereby potentially achieve astounding things , like being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia or cause huntington 's disease .
additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease , such as monkeys .
we also want to understand better how to control the way that dna is repaired after it 's cut , and also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off-target , or unintended effects of using the technology .
and actually , there is an important precedent for such a pause from the 1970s , when scientists got together to call for a moratorium on the use of molecular cloning , until the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and validated .
your attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or a quarantine is incredibly responsible .
jd : well , i hope that we can air the views of many different individuals and stakeholders who want to think about how to use this technology responsibly .
the diversity of the content is what 's amazing .
but i am , thanks to this exhibition , that has really taught me about the craftsmanship behind the soul of a japanese doll .
this is where i come from , todmorden .
but then , we 're just a community group , you know .
so we did some really simple things .
i visited a camp for workers .
( applause )
as john sits on dan 's bed , a train goes rushing by , rattling everything in the room .
see this little sticker ?
that sticker was n't there when i was a kid .
you felt upset .
remember learning to drive ?
your hands clenched at 10 and 2 on the wheel , looking at every single object out there — the cars , the lights , the pedestrians .
but then something interesting happened .
as the weeks went by , driving became easier and easier .
it started to become fun and second nature .
if it stops us from noticing the problems that are around us , well , that 's bad .
he tells us about the time he visited his friends and he just wanted to take a comfortable shower .
he just wanted a comfortable shower .
but designers , innovators and entrepreneurs , it 's our job to not just notice those things , but to go one step further and try to fix them .
why ?
what did we do instead ?
but back then , we noticed that detail and we fixed it , and now everyone else does that as well .
there 's far too many experienced people in the ted community who would know much more about that than i ever will .
but let me leave you with a few tips that i do , that we all can do , to fight habituation .
but it turned out that no one saved any energy .
they just did n't know how their weeks would change season to season , year to year .
but it turned out , it did n't .
you can see the six solar collectors at the center there .
did you see wall-e ?
but how do you make it look underwater ?
here we have the fog beams .
but we are not beholden to it .
and then we have our eureka moment .
you can see it light up these gray aperture blades .
this is the perfect time to bring back that glassy-eyed look .
in the next scene , wall-e comes back to life .
we bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back , and he returns to that sweet , soulful robot we 've come to love .
as we went along , we were floundering .
that scientific tether was strangling the scene .
and i got excited .
`` just long enough for me to think , `` oh no , this is doomed . '' ''
it 's this interweaving of art and science that elevates the world to a place of wonder , a place with soul , a place we can believe in , a place where the things you imagine can become real — and a world where a girl suddenly realizes not only is she a scientist , but also an artist .
hello .
i become the hat after my own gigs , but i have to physically stand there and take the help from people , and unlike the guy in the opening band , i 've actually had a lot of practice standing there .
so i fought my way off my label , and for my next project with my new band , the grand theft orchestra , i turned to crowdfunding .
( applause ) and you can see how many people it is .
i would be shocked if you had n't .
this is a technology — it 's for genome editing — and it 's so versatile and so controversial that it 's sparking all sorts of really interesting conversations .
should we bring back the woolly mammoth ?
`` now , crispr has been the subject of a huge media hype , and the words that are used most often are `` '' easy '' '' and `` '' cheap . '' '' so what i want to do is drill down a little bit deeper and look into some of the myths and the realities around crispr . ''
i like to think of it as a guided missile .
it 's a system that we stole from an ancient , ancient bacterial immune system .
this is really easy to design , and it 's really cheap to buy .
there are two major repair pathways .
the first just takes the dna and shoves the two pieces back together .
this is n't a very efficient system , because what happens is sometimes a base drops out or a base is added .
it 's an ok way to maybe , like , knock out a gene , but it 's not the way that we really want to do genome editing .
the second repair pathway is a lot more interesting .
in this repair pathway , it takes a homologous piece of dna .
so you can change a letter , you can take letters out , but most importantly , you can stuff new dna in , kind of like a trojan horse .
the thing is that there 's a lot of talk about it being cheap and it being easy .
`` i 'm starting to get emails from people that say stuff like , `` '' hey , can i come to your open night and , like , maybe use crispr and engineer my genome ? '' '' ( laugher ) like , seriously . ''
it 's going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars , and it cuts the time a lot , too .
we do n't really know that much about cells .
so you take the virus , you put the crispr into it , you let the virus infect the cell .
but now you 've got this virus in there , and we do n't know what the long-term effects of that are .
these are not trivial questions , and there are scientists that are trying to solve them , and they will eventually , hopefully , be solved .
but what is happening is that crispr is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists to do really , really important work , like making better models of diseases in animals , for example , or for taking pathways that produce valuable chemicals and getting them into industrial production in fermentation vats , or even doing really basic research on what genes do .
so i would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies , because , really , only in that way are we going to be able to guide the development of these technologies , the use of these technologies and make sure that , in the end , it 's a positive outcome — for both the planet and for us .
i heard this amazing story about miuccia prada .
`` her friend says , `` '' buy it already . '' '' she said , `` '' i 'll buy it , but i 'm also going to replicate it . '' '' now , the academics in this audience may think , `` well , that sounds like plagiarism . '' ''
you might also be asking whether it 's possible that this is illegal for her to do this .
they did n't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing .
we think of it as maybe too silly , too unnecessary .
what i 'm going to argue today is that because there 's no copyright protection in the fashion industry , fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design , things to cover our naked bodies , into something that we consider art .
they 're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist .
maybe just a little .
so , one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying , which is really what it is , is the establishment of trends .
and that 's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration , so it 's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry .
if you can get it for 200 bucks , why pay a thousand ?
`` we invited tom ford to come — the conference was called , `` '' ready to share : fashion and the ownership of creativity '' '' — and we asked him exactly this question . ''
and , you know , a knock-off is never the same as an original high-end design , at least in terms of the materials ; they 're always made of cheaper materials .
and this is a good thing . we need lots of options .
fashion , whether you like it or not , helps you project who you are to the world .
i tell you , there is no rest for the fashionable .
it forced him to be a little more innovative . ( music ) and that actually reminded me of jazz great , charlie parker .
i do n't know if you 've heard this anecdote , but i have .
but now , we have a different kind of comic .
and their jokes , much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer , really only work within that aesthetic .
very low novelty standard , anybody can register anything .
but this has not stopped diane von furstenberg .
that is a very difficult question to answer .
it takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time , and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive .
there 's a bunch of other industries that do n't have copyright protection , including the food industry .
same with automobiles .
magic tricks , i think they 're instructions , sort of like recipes : no copyright protection .
fireworks displays , the rules of games , the smell of perfume : no .
because right now , those industries with a lot of copyright protection are operating in an atmosphere where it 's as if they do n't have any protection , and they do n't know what to do .
`` i want a picture . '' '' and the lawyers do not provide a picture , so i made one . ''
first : is something an artistic object ?
is it a utilitarian object ?
the other one is : is it an idea ?
no protection .
he 's smart , he 's smart .
and my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future .
if you want more information about this research project , please visit our website : it 's readytoshare.org .
and i really want to thank veronica jauriqui for making this very fashionable presentation .
thank you so much . ( applause )
`` not sure what i 'm going to do yet , '' '' i told polly . ''
`` without hesitation , she replied , `` '' i 've had an abortion . '' '' before polly , no one had ever told me that she 'd had an abortion . ''
i worried that i would regret an abortion later .
but polly had given me a very special gift : the knowledge that i was n't alone and the realization that abortion was something that we can talk about .
it 's political and polarizing .
there is a gap .
the personal experiences that were n't fitting neatly into one box or the other .
simple designs for infection control had not been thought about , and people had died because of it .
and even in poughkeepsie , my hometown , we thought about old industrial infrastructure .
and they had a plan to mark every county where these lynchings occurred , and build a national memorial to the victims of lynching in montgomery , alabama .
their names will be engraved on the markers that hang above us .
the age of the universe , between now and the big bang , is a hundred billion in dog years .
that kind of makes sense to us .
so part of our understanding of this was given to us by ludwig boltzmann , an austrian physicist in the 19th century .
it 's the randomness , the disorder , the chaoticness of some systems .
a low entropy configuration is one in which there 's only a few arrangements that look that way .
the fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that 's because entropy is increasing .
what he did n't explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
we 'd like to understand that .
`` he gave the popular lectures that became `` '' the character of physical law . '' '' he gave lectures to caltech undergrads that became `` '' the feynman lectures on physics . '' '' he gave lectures to caltech graduate students that became `` '' the feynman lectures on gravitation . '' '' in every one of these books , every one of these sets of lectures , he emphasized this puzzle : why did the early universe have such a small entropy ? ''
it 's not true that we 've figured it out by now .
the reason the problem has gotten worse , rather than better , is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we did n't know before .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we do n't know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that 's the theory of dark energy .
it 's just the idea that empty space itself has energy .
some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future .
but if there 's dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever .
there 's a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon .
so even though time goes on forever , space is limited to us .
finally , empty space has a temperature .
in the 1970s , stephen hawking told us that a black hole , even though you think it 's black , it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics .
everything that is allowed , every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room , would eventually be obtained .
so his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere — the everything molecules .
so it 's not that entropy must always increase — you can get fluctuations into lower entropy , more organized situations .
remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time .
so boltzmann says , we will only live in the part of the multiverse , in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles , where life is possible .
and the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal .
if the universe is not a fluctuation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?
the universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so .
but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
the future is much longer than the past .
so here 's two questions for you .
number one : if the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years , why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the warm , comfortable afterglow of the big bang ?
why are n't we in empty space ?
you could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness .
and even better , we will understand what happened at the big bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations .
but we 've been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years .
thank you .
what is poetry ?
i 'm going to ask you to tell me which one 's which .
it simply means that the category of the human is unstable .
`` `` '' ... youngest republican , '' '' okay , we 're finished . ''
now , you know , i mean , a lot of people go to church .
i 'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church .
and i 'm not talking about the god thing .
they hold potluck dinners .
and not only food , right .
these very same people are strong believers , in lots of contexts , in the limits on the markets .
because they understand : there are places for the market and places where the market should not exist , where we should be free to enjoy the fellowship of others .
and the second great thing about conservatives : they get ecology .
it 's our real social lives themselves that are transmuted into art .
ll : and then , here 's for me , the critical key to what julian has to say ...
the mashup is owned by lucas .
our lives are sharing activities , at least in part .
freedom , which means without permission from anyone , the ability to create .
it is outrageous .
john mccain .
it 's a value of the limits in regulation .
they went out into the field to answer a particular question .
we also have to have energy .
why ? we look at the inner planets .
it 's got no water .
the planet mars and then three moons of the outer planets : titan , europa and small enceladus .
our higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gulleys that were there in the past .
these craters are weeping during the summer .
we 're going to launch a series of missions to begin that search for life on mars .
as we move out into the solar system , here 's the tiny moon enceladus .
what a fabulous environment .
oceanographers were completely surprised .
another moon , very similar , is europa .
and if there are organics there , there may be life .
this is a fabulous set of discoveries because these moons have been in this environment like that for billions of years .
we see lakes ...
and this area is not liquid water ; it 's methane .
thank you .
[ beautiful ] [ intriguing ] so you do n't have to say a lot .
if i can ask an indiscreet question , how many of you have tattoos ?
a few , but not most .
what happens if facebook , google , twitter , linkedin , cell phones , gps , foursquare , yelp , travel advisor , all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos ?
so you can take a picture with an iphone and get all the names , although , again , sometimes it does make mistakes . ( laughter ) but that means you can take a typical bar scene like this , take a picture , say , of this guy right here , get the name , and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody , because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos .
so lesson number one : sisyphus .
lesson number three : atalanta .
well , he had all these wonderful little golden apples , and she 'd run ahead , and he 'd roll a little golden apple .
she 'd run ahead , and he 'd roll a little golden apple .
nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with narcissus .
last lesson , from a latin american : this is the great poet jorge luis borges .
thank you .
now , you need a laptop .
we lived in ethiopia for a month , working at an orphanage .
look at the response to the tsunami — it 's inspiring .
does n't compassion look well on us ?
and i say that as a fan , you know ?
what on earth can we all do about this ?
i really believe that , the people in this room .
do we have the will ?
the ones that ted has offered to grant .
where do you come from ?
it 's such a simple question , but these days , of course , simple questions bring ever more complicated answers .
my home would have to be whatever i carried around inside me .
and in so many ways , i think this is a terrific liberation .
certainly when i 'm traveling , especially to the major cities of the world , the typical person i meet today will be , let 's say , a half-korean , half-german young woman living in paris .
they move to new york city .
it 's the place where you become yourself .
i had spent 15 years in anglican schools , so i had had enough hymnals and crosses to last me a lifetime .
several lifetimes , actually .
all around me were 800 acres of wild dry brush .
and i went down to the room in which i was to be sleeping .
but movement , ultimately , only has a meaning if you have a home to go back to .
a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task , until now .
hello , my name is dennis hong , and we 're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired .
so in 2007 , our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition .
so we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch .
so how does it work ?
so we have three steps .
we have perception , computation and non-visual interfaces .
we fuse that information with a gps unit to get an estimate of the location of the car .
but today we 're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces .
another device is called speedstrip .
the computer tells you how to drive — turn left , turn right , speed up , stop .
so think of it as a monitor for the blind .
so it 's a small tablet , has many holes in it , and compressed air comes out , so it can actually draw images .
we also had some surprises . let 's take a look .
now let 's see if mark avoids it .
third box is out . the fourth box is out .
and he 's perfectly making his way between the two .
he 's closing in on the van to make the moving pass .
he 's approaching the end of the run , makes his way between the barrels that are set up there .
( applause ) dh : so since we started this project , we 've been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
`` letters thanking us , but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one : `` now i understand why there is braille on a drive-up atm machine . '' ''
there 's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality .
and together with this new type of interfaces , we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people .
i am passionate about the american landscape and how the physical form of the land , from the great central valley of california to the bedrock of manhattan , has really shaped our history and our character .
in the last 100 years alone , our country — and this is a sprawl map of america — our country has systematically flattened and homogenized the landscape to the point where we 've forgotten our relationship with the plants and animals that live alongside us and the dirt beneath our feet .
and so , how i see my work contributing is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections and physically rebuild them .
`` and you can see from the arrow here indicating `` '' you are here , '' '' i 'm trying to sort of blend and meld these two very divergent fields of urbanism and ecology , and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way . ''
we need new tools and new approaches .
so we need new stories , new heroes and new tools .
so now i want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war , and that is the eastern oyster .
now the gowanus is particularly smelly — i will admit it .
so our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept , harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern .
and the idea has two core stages .
one is to develop a new artificial ecology , a reef out in the harbor , that would then protect new settlement patterns inland and the gowanus .
and one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day .
many , many species depend on them .
it can move from a fertilized egg to a spat , which is when they 're floating through the water , and when they 're ready to attach onto another oyster , to an adult male oyster or female oyster , in a number of weeks .
we reinterpreted this life cycle on the scale of our sight and took the gowanus as a giant oyster nursery where oysters would be grown up in the gowanus , then paraded down in their spat stage and seeded out on the bayridge reef .
how does the reef work ? well , it 's very , very simple .
so this image is simply showing — it 's a field of marine piles interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope .
so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project .
so you can imagine a sort of new manner of living with a new relationship with the water , and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs in terms of monitoring .
you can see the eight chambers on the side host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them .
one is : why is n't it happening now ?
to conclude , this is just one cross-section of one piece of city , but my dream is , my hope is , that when you all go back to your own cities that we can start to work together and collaborate on remaking and reforming a new urban landscape towards a more sustainable , a more livable and a more delicious future .
now , montel williams is an intelligent man .
( applause )
this began an incredible archaeological partnership .
many seek .
i did n't know where i was .
never are we so present as when we are in the midst of the great past .
the great pyramid of giza was built one stone at a time with 2.3 million blocks , with incredible bureaucratic efficiency .
it is not the pyramids that stand the test of time ; it is human ingenuity .
history may be cyclical , but we are singular .
what you 're looking at is a medical tool used to treat syphilis .
we 're back at the site just south of cairo .
you ca n't see anything .
we would all do the same to feed our families ; i do n't blame the local looters .
my team and i have just completed a study looking at looting in egypt .
we found evidence of looting and site destruction at 267 sites , and mapped over 200,000 looting pits .
north lisht .
let me put into perspective for you what was taken .
imagine a two meter by two meter area full of coffins , jewelry and incredible statuary .
multiply that times over a thousand .
that 's what was taken .
and then one day , this appeared .
you can see it written out here , in hieroglyphs .
working together with my egyptian team , we had restored someone 's name from 3,900 years ago .
it 's about what you can prove possible .
sometimes when you travel , you end up finding long-lost family — not those with whom you share genes , but a shared entry in the book of life .
twins .
i knew then we 'd always work together — not in my brain , but in the part of your soul that knows not everything can be explained .
by creating a 21st-century army of global explorers , we 'll find and protect the world 's hidden heritage , which contains clues to humankind 's collective resilience and creativity .
there are only a couple hundred of us space archaeologists around the world .
all the data that you help us collect will be shared with vetted authorities , and will help create a new global alarm system to help protect sites .
if we want to learn about the past , it 's time we inverted the pyramids .
but the only way we 're going to be able to write it is if we do it together .
thank you .
so i 'm preparing to get alzheimer 's disease .
( laughter ) maybe .
and more streets with mathematicians ' names , too .
it is about imagination , the talent which we most praise .
they are inaccessible to our senses but can be seen through mathematical lenses .
and open your eyes now to the statistics of the velocities of these particles .
the famous bell-shaped gauss curve , or the law of errors — of deviations with respect to the mean behavior .
let 's see what happens when we look at all these random trajectories together .
and this is touching the mystery of that goddess , replacing a beautiful coincidence by a beautiful explanation .
they also change our vision of the world .
these stories show that mathematics is able to make us go out of our intuition measure the earth which seems infinite , see atoms which are invisible or detect an imperceptible variation of shape .
and from the graph we also see that person number four is a prime witness .
ok , that was easy , but now what about if you have a big bunch of people who will testify ?
enter pagerank , one of the early cornerstones of google .
so let 's send into this graph a bunch of tiny , digital marbles and let them go randomly through the graph .
and again , and again , and again .
and why not stochastic processes , linear programming , or fluid simulation ?
now with all this beauty , usefulness and wealth , mathematics does look more sexy .
in the perfect world of plasma , there are no collisions and no friction to provide the stability like we are used to .
but still , if you slightly perturb a plasma equilibrium , you will find that the resulting electric field spontaneously vanishes , or damps out , as if by some mysterious friction force .
and gratitude to the many collaborators who made this possible .
we ca n't see into the engine room .
so everything that matters , that 's important , is invisible .
`` and on the photograph , he wrote with a flourish , `` to horse face , with love from geoffrey dickens , m.p . '' ''
that 's what he thought he was there for .
is n't that incredible that we ca n't read each other 's minds ?
in the sufi faith , this great middle eastern religion , which some claim is the route of all religions , sufi masters are all telepaths , so they say .
with artificial intelligence , not only have they not created artificial intelligence , they have n't yet created artificial stupidity .
( laughter ) the laws of physics : invisible , eternal , omnipresent , all-powerful .
i refuse to be drawn on the question of whether god exists , until somebody properly defines the terms .
( laughter ) another thing we ca n't see is the human genome .
( laughter ) you ca n't see these things , but they are very strange . ( laughter )
the stars by day . i always think that 's fascinating .
i do n't know if you know this . modern physics , there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time does n't really exist , because it 's too inconvenient for the figures .
`` one of the interesting things about the past is you particularly ca n't see . my son asked me this the other day , he said , `` '' dad , can you remember what i was like when i was two ? '' '' and i said , `` '' yes . '' '' and he said , `` '' why ca n't i ? '' '' is n't that extraordinary ? you can not remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three , which is great news for psychoanalysts , because otherwise they 'd be out of a job . ''
because that 's where all the stuff happens ( laughter ) that makes you who you are .
another thing you ca n't see is the grid on which we hang .
okay . atoms , you ca n't see them .
gas was invented in 1600 by a dutch chemist called van helmont .
did n't catch on , unfortunately .
( laughter ) but well done , him . ( laughter )
but it 's odd that you ca n't see the beam of light , you can only see what it hits .
( laughter ) you probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire , do n't you , at the speed of light when you turn the light on . they do n't .
( laughter ) galaxies , 100 billion of them estimated in the universe .
`` what 's the point of these radio waves that you 've found ? '' '' and he said , `` '' well , i 've no idea . ''
it is incredible how little we know .
but the point , what i 've got it down to , is there are only two questions really worth asking .
`` but i 'm pretty sure it 's not in order to enjoy ourselves . '' '' ( laughter ) he was a cheerful bastard was n't he ? ( laughter ) ''
`` what the others are here for , i 've no idea . '' '' ( laughter ) ( applause ) ''
that 's like from wall street at the southern edge of manhattan up to maybe 120th street .
this might be , what ? i do n't know , half the size of manhattan .
this is the infrastructure as we see it about now .
that 's just one example of how miniaturization can save lives .
this is a blood vessel in the body .
the kidney is a filter .
thank you .
actually , that whole row is n't right . ( laughter ) that 's not good . hi . yeah . real bad . do n't even look at me . ( laughter ) i am one of the one in four . thank you .
`` she had two sponges in her hand , and then she had two tied to her knees . my mother was completely absorbent . ( laughter ) and she would crawl around behind me going , `` who brings footprints into a building ? ! '' ''
so that was kind of a clue that things were n't right .
what am i going to talk about ? okay .
i always dreamt that , when i had my final breakdown , it would be because i had a deep kafkaesque existentialist revelation , or that maybe cate blanchett would play me and she would win an oscar for it . ( laughter ) but that 's not what happened . i had my breakdown during my daughter 's sports day .
and all the girlies , girlies running , running , running , everybody except for my daughter , who was just standing at the starting line , just waving , because she did n't know she was supposed to run .
`` because i did n't think of that . ( laughter ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) because , you know , the one thing , one thing that you get with this disease , this one comes with a package , is you get a real sense of shame , because your friends go , `` '' oh come on , show me the lump , show me the x-rays , '' '' and of course you 've got nothing to show , so you 're , like , really disgusted with yourself because you 're thinking , `` i 'm not being carpet-bombed . i do n't live in a township . '' ''
how come every other organ in your body can get sick and you get sympathy , except the brain ?
there is some good news . first of all , let me say , we 've come a long , long way .
i do n't know if you can get that here . ( laughter ) so , zizzing away , and so — ( laughter ) — and for every one — i know , i drew this myself . thank you .
can you imagine , every human being is carrying that equipment , even paris hilton ? ( laughter ) go figure .
we are not equipped for the 21st century .
your pets are happier than you are . ( laughter ) ( applause ) so kitty cat , meow , happy happy happy , human beings , screwed . ( laughter ) completely and utterly — so , screwed .
the industrial era started two seconds ago .
but i like to think back further to the ultimate cause .
some of my colleagues think we 're on the verge of something that could cause a profound change in that substrate , and that is machine superintelligence .
so the question is , how far are we from being able to match those tricks ?
but even a present-day transistor operates at the gigahertz .
it 's likely , rather , to swoosh right by .
here it gets trickier .
the point is , we should not be confident that we have this under control here .
so we disconnect the ethernet cable to create an air gap , but again , like merely human hackers routinely transgress air gaps using social engineering .
instead , we would create an a.i . that uses its intelligence to learn what we value , and its motivation system is constructed in such a way that it is motivated to pursue our values or to perform actions that it predicts we would approve of .
and there are also some esoteric issues that would need to be solved , sorted out : the exact details of its decision theory , how to deal with logical uncertainty and so forth .
people were using the hashtag to do many different things .
but very soon , i would shed siswati .
but of course , this luxury was not available to everybody .
and i think that thing is social pan-africanism .
but now we have opportunities to back each other up in ways we never could before .
we support angolan journalists who are being illegally detained .
the cleaner came into the synagogue .
`` `` you mean god did n't want my bread ? '' ''
`` you 've misunderstood totally , '' '' he said . ''
this little space became a small phenomenon , and because it had such a profound impact on new yorkers , it made an enormous impression on me .
well , i would sit in the park and watch very carefully , and first among other things were the comfortable , movable chairs .
people would come in , find their own seat , move it a bit , actually , and then stay a while , and then interestingly , people themselves attracted other people , and ironically , i felt more peaceful if there were other people around .
unfortunately , that 's not how cities were being designed .
so here you see a familiar sight .
they not only look desolate , they feel downright dangerous .
they are plinths for their creations .
they might tolerate a sculpture or two , but that 's about it .
there 's nothing to water , nothing to maintain , and no undesirable people to worry about .
and he said to me on that very day , he said that new york was projected to grow from eight to nine million people .
our city could n't possibly handle any more cars .
so what were we going to do ?
if we could n't spread out , we had to go up .
but we had never before thought of how we could make the most of it .
so here was the answer to our puzzle .
if we were to channel and redirect all new development around transit , we could actually handle that population increase , we thought .
by listening . so i began listening , in fact , thousands of hours of listening just to establish trust .
it 's not something you can just fake .
my mission was always to create great public spaces .
and then it opened , and i have to tell you , it was incredible .
but i thought if we went to the lower manhattan development corporation and got money to reclaim this two miles of degraded waterfront that it would have an enormous effect on the rebuilding of lower manhattan .
you know , railings have to be higher now , so we put bar seating at the edge , and you can get so close to the water you 're practically on it .
how do you turn a park into a place that people want to be ?
you do n't tap into your design expertise .
you tap into your humanity .
can you find your very own seat ?
where broadway traffic used to run , there are now tables and chairs .
but claiming these spaces for public use was not simple , and it 's even harder to keep them that way .
so now i 'm going to tell you a story about a very unusual park called the high line .
i knew if there was a day that i did n't worry about the high line , it would come down .
would n't that be terrific and wo n't it mean a lot more money for the city ?
most recently , the last section of the high line , the third section of the high line , the final section of the high line , has been pitted against development interests , where some of the city 's leading developers are building more than 17 million square feet at the hudson yards .
it 's not just the number of people using them , it 's the even greater number of people who feel better about their city just knowing that they are there .
public space can change how you live in a city , how you feel about a city , whether you choose one city over another , and public space is one of the most important reasons why you stay in a city .
that tension between the need to express , the need to discover , then you put something new into it , and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship .
behind the lean-to was a dump , maybe 40 feet square with rotting apple cores and balled-up aluminum foil , and a dead sneaker .
here in new york , the department of sanitation cleans up after us , to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day .
what 's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden ?
so i started a research project with them .
i needed to go deeper .
and i operated the mechanical brooms and i plowed the snow .
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education .
the weight takes a long time to get used to .
i knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week .
according to the bureau of labor statistics , sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occupations in the country , and i learned why .
i also learned about the relentlessness of trash .
and then there 's the stigma .
you put on the uniform , and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you 've blocked traffic with your truck , or you 're taking a break too close to their home , or you 're drinking coffee in their diner , and they will come and scorn you , and tell you that they do n't want you anywhere near them .
i find the stigma especially ironic , because i strongly believe that sanitation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city , for three reasons .
they are the first guardians of public health .
the economy needs them .
they 're on the streets every day , rhythmically .
you know when to expect them .
and their work lets us do our work .
the flow that they maintain keeps us safe from ourselves , from our own dross , our cast-offs , and that flow must be maintained always no matter what .
and if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island , and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better , i would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee , not on myself .
the real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level ; it 's on the collective level .
one versus one , or even 10 versus 10 , chimpanzees might be better than us .
just imagine wembley stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees .
the next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is : how , exactly , do we do it ?
we can cooperate flexibly with countless numbers of strangers , because we alone , of all the animals on the planet , can create and believe fictions , fictional stories .
`` a human can say , `` '' look , there is a god above the clouds ! ''
the same is true of the political field .
but what are states and nations ?
they are not an objective reality .
take this green piece of paper , the dollar bill .
now , we see the creation of a new massive class of useless people .
one is power transition , which is change of power amongst states .
those two things are the huge shifts of power in our century .
that 's important and it 's an important shift .
anybody can play in the game .
some of that 's good : oxfam , a great non-governmental actor .
and you can think back to 1941 when the government of japan attacked the united states at pearl harbor .
you might think of that as the privatization of war .
now the problem is that we 're not thinking about it in very innovative ways .
so let me step back and ask : what 's power ?
indeed , if you can learn to use more soft power , you can save a lot on carrots and sticks .
and we have to think much more in terms of narratives and whose narrative is going to be effective .
the tectonic plates of world politics were shifting .
if we try to focus on the reality , then what we need to focus on is what 's really happening in terms of china and the united states .
goldman sachs has projected that china , the chinese economy , will surpass that of the u.s .
the second thing is that the chinese economy passes the u.s. economy in , let 's say , 2030 , which it may it , that will be a measure of total economic size , but not of per capita income — wo n't tell you about the composition of the economy .
you know , it looks at economic power measured by gdp .
does n't tell you much about military power , does n't tell you very much about soft power .
if you 're sitting in japan , or in new delhi , or in hanoi , your view of the rise of china is a little different than if you 're sitting in beijing .
so there are people who are telling us this is going to be reproduced today , that what we 're going to see is the same thing now in this century .
for one thing , germany had surpassed britain in industrial strength by 1900 .
and if we have policies in which we take it in that larger historical perspective , we 're going to be able to manage this process .
if you ask how is power distributed in the world today , it 's distributed much like a three-dimensional chess game .
middle board of this three-dimensional chess game : economic power among states .
now i do n't mean to be pollyannaish about this .
all this still persists .
but unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that i call smart power , you 're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we 're facing .
and that 's the good news i have . we can do that .
the same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart .
just like many of them , i was completely apolitical until 2009 .
in june 2010 , internet changed my life forever .
i saw myself in his picture .
i saw a spark of hope .
`` egyptians on social media were wondering , `` if tunisia did it , why ca n't we ? '' ''
it helped a decentralized movement arise .
and it made it impossible for the regime to stop it .
then came the consequences .
`` the government must be planning a massacre tomorrow . '' '' i was hit hard on my head . ''
and three days later , mubarak was forced to step down .
it was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life .
my online world became a battleground filled with trolls , lies , hate speech .
people in the center , like me , started feeling helpless .
first , we do n't know how to deal with rumors .
second , we create our own echo chambers .
and fourth , it became really hard to change our opinions .
our first product is a new media platform for conversations .
these are conversations that matter .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the people are illiterate .
war and malnutrition kills people together with hope .
you may know this from the media , but what you may not know is that the average age of the afghan people is 17 years old , which means they grow up in such an environment and — i repeat myself — in 30 years of war .
local and foreign military are supposed to build peace together with the donors and the governmental and non-governmental organizations .
because people do n't have tools to cope with it , to get over it .
so , soon after my arrival , i had confirmed something which i had already known ; that my instruments come from the heart of modern europe , yes .
and the big challenge was how to understand the meaning of the symptom in this specific cultural context .
so , husbands start beating wives , mothers and fathers beat their children , and afterward , they feel awful .
the desperate try to restore order and normality , and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence , it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt .
and partly this is already happening .
but let me repeat the words of the woman .
`` so everybody must be able to say , `` '' this happened to me , and it did this with me , but i 'm able to live with it , to cope with it , and to learn from it . ''
this was our sign — it 's hand-painted , and we had 45 all over kabul .
we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho-social care and psycho-social counselors to the system .
and here you can see the patients all had symptoms of depression , moderate and severe .
and the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only , without medication .
and doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients , but now this will change .
`` one hazara said to his pashtun counselor , `` '' if we were to have met some years ago , then we would have killed each other . ''
i thought it was an idea worth spreading , and i think it must be , can be , could be replicated elsewhere .
let me tell you a little bit about why this is .
you see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup .
there are thousands of children using this , you know , all over the world , and i started thinking about what it does and what it does n't do .
it 's also the way in which these words are arranged , the way these words are modified and arranged .
and so after i developed avaz , i worried for a very long time about how i could give grammar to children with autism .
i happened to chance upon a child with autism conversing with her mom , and this is what happened .
`` you want to eat cream now ? you want to eat ice cream in the evening ? '' '' and then it struck me that what the mother had done was something incredible . ''
she had been able to get that child to communicate an idea to her without grammar .
and so if you do this , then what you 're conveying is not a sentence in english , but what you 're conveying is really a meaning , the meaning of a sentence in english .
now , meaning is really the underbelly , in some sense , of language .
and the idea was that this particular representation might convey meaning in its raw form .
why is this not enough ?
so , who told ? i told .
i told whom ? i told the carpenter .
i told the carpenter i could not pay him .
`` i did n't have to start with the word `` '' tell . '' '' i could have started anywhere in the sentence , and i could have made this entire thing . ''
so i call this freespeech , and i was playing with this for many , many months .
i was trying to convert language , convert sentences in english into sentences in freespeech , and vice versa , and back and forth .
so i could actually write this set of rules that translates from this particular representation into english .
and i had an idea , and i want to talk to you about this idea next .
they 're directly constructing the sentence .
and so this gave me this idea .
is it possible to use freespeech not for children with autism but to teach language to people without disabilities ?
the first thing i did was i built a jigsaw puzzle in which these questions and answers are coded in the form of shapes , in the form of colors , and you have people putting these together and trying to understand how this works .
and i built an app out of it , a game out of it , in which children can play with words and with a reinforcement , a sound reinforcement of visual structures , they 're able to learn language .
and this , this has a lot of potential , a lot of promise , and the government of india recently licensed this technology from us , and they 're going to try it out with millions of different children trying to teach them english .
why is it one-dimensional ?
it 's one-dimensional because it 's sound .
but if you think about the brain , the thoughts that we have in our heads are not one-dimensional .
but if you look at what 's inside the engine , it 's actually not very complicated .
it might be very easy for us to actually create these engines in many , many different languages , in hindi , in french , in german , in swahili .
i could create content in one language , freespeech , and the person who 's consuming that content , the person who 's reading that particular information could choose any engine , and they could read it in their own mother tongue , in their native language .
we have so many different languages .
i want to leave you with this .
and everything that she 's accomplished so far , finishing school , going to college , starting a company , collaborating with me to develop avaz , all of these things she 's done with nothing more than moving her eyes .
they 're all different .
he would have the sound coming through the resonators .
and design is responsible for this experience .
they sent dogs trained to smell explosives to sweep the area i 'd been in .
that 's illegal under federal law .
ferguson was issuing an average of over two arrest warrants , per person , per year , mostly for unpaid debt to the courts .
i 've met many of the people in ferguson who have experienced this , and i 've heard some of their stories .
it reminded me that these illegal extortion schemes are n't being run somewhere in the shadows , they 're being run out in the open by our public officials .
they 're a matter of public policy .
how are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that ?
what 's the kind of technique ?
so i 'll show you the next movie .
and so i forgot to tell you the scale .
thank you .
what is it made of ?
and it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force .
i was eight at the time , living in the village with my grandmother , who was raising me and other children .
famine had hit my country of zimbabwe , and we just did n't have enough to eat .
we were hungry .
`` as she handed me my porridge , i asked her why she was there , and without hesitation , she said , `` as africans , we must uplift all the people of africa . '' ''
two years later , famine hit my country for the second time .
you see , in the village , we were all equal .
but in the eyes and the minds of the other kids , i was not their equal .
but this feeling of inequality would get even more complex .
the initiative is based on a simple idea : that what we share is much more powerful than what divides us .
however , engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial .
`` we heard from a man out of zimbabwe , who , after hearing about heforshe , created a `` '' husband school . '' '' ( laughter ) he literally went around his village , hand-picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners , and committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers . ''
within a few hours , i heard the woman cry again next door , but for the first time , i did n't just sit there .
i felt compelled to do something , so i went over and i confronted the husband .
we are calling upon governments , businesses , universities , to change their policies .
already , a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up and made some concrete heforshe commitments .
we are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life , and from every single corner in the world , from the united nations ' own secretary-general ban ki-moon to the secretary-generals of nato and the eu council , from the prime minister of bhutan to the president of sierra leone .
the rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador , emma watson , has garnered more than five billion media impressions , mobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world to create more than a hundred heforshe student associations .
this delusion is a kind of prison for us ...
heforshe is tapping into women 's and men 's dreams , the dreams that we have for ourselves , and the dreams that we have for our families , our children , friends , communities .
this pill also — millions of people have taken it , the company did studies , the fda looked at it — all good .
`` `` '' but nick , there 's a problem . ''
`` i said , `` '' nick , this is very cool . ''
so , how did it just do that ?
cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system .
like all our past creations and innovations , they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused .
`` so in the search box i typed in `` mother 's day , '' and i was surprised and delighted to see a list of dozens and dozens of mother 's day cards that showed up on the scratch website , many of them just in the past 24 hours by procrastinators just like myself . ''
`` another one was an interactive project where , when you moved the mouse over the letters of `` '' happy mom day , '' '' it reveals a special happy mother 's day slogan . ''
( music ) in this one , the creator told a narrative about how she had googled to find out when mother 's day was happening .
when you become fluent with language , it means you can write an entry in your journal or tell a joke to someone or write a letter to a friend .
it 's almost as if they can read but not write with new technologies .
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
and that triggered a debate in the u.k .
when many people think of coding , they think of it as something that only a very narrow sub-community of people are going to be doing , and they think of coding looking like this .
let me show you about what it 's like to code in scratch .
of the millions of projects on the scratch website , there 's everything from animated stories to school science projects to anime soap operas to virtual construction kits to recreations of classic video games to political opinion polls to trigonometry tutorials to interactive artwork , and , yes , interactive mother 's day cards .
here 's an example .
( crickets chirping ) ( shouts ) ( chomping ) ( laughter ) ( applause ) as kids are creating projects like this , they 're learning to code , but even more importantly , they 're coding to learn .
he wanted to keep score .
so this was a game where the big fish eats the little fish , but he wanted to keep score , so that each time the big fish eats the little fish , the score would go up and it would keep track , and he did n't know how to do that .
he took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish .
`` and he saw this , and he was so excited , he reached his hand out to me , and he said , `` '' thank you , thank you , thank you . '' '' and what went through my mind was , how often is it that teachers are thanked by their students for teaching them variables ? ( laughter ) it does n't happen in most classrooms , but that 's because in most classrooms , when kids learn about variables , they do n't know why they 're learning it . ''
now he had a reason for learning variables .
they 're relevant for all sorts of different activities .
it 's probably not so likely , but regardless of what he does , he 'll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned .
and it 's not just about your work life .
coding can also enable you to express your ideas and feelings in your personal life .
so this is an example that came from after i had sent the mother 's day cards to my mom , she decided that she wanted to learn scratch .
so she made this project for my birthday and sent me a happy birthday scratch card .
now this project is not going to win any prizes for design , and you can rest assured that my 83-year-old mom is not training to become a professional programmer or computer scientist .
but working on this project enabled her to make a connection to someone that she cares about and enabled her to keep on learning new things and continuing to practice her creativity and developing new ways of expressing herself .
it 's scratch.mit.edu , and give a try at coding .
thanks very much . ( applause )
there 's not a lot of science behind that one either .
volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere .
the ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
this was — this is south of the antarctic circle .
here 's how we sample the corals .
this coral is eight meters tall , right .
you can see some of the coral cores there on the right .
this is as messy as it gets .
do you see where i 'm going with this ?
and i wanted to show the number .
only because her name happens to sound like a boy 's was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam to come to the united states .
because of her bravery and passion , i 've had all the opportunities that she never did , and that has made my story so different .
instead of running away from big institutions , i 've actually run toward them .
but why is that ?
ok. do any of you go to the restaurant and order the sustainably farmed trout instead of the miso-glazed chilean sea bass that you really wish you could have ?
look at some of the things that are on it , that it says .
`` `` this one cup may inspire others to use one too . '' ''
we believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command : make more money .
`` put in the wrong words like `` '' promote social justice , '' '' and you might see your gold coins shrink or even vanish entirely , according to this fable . ''
overwhelmingly , people wanted to add those extra words into the formula .
now , harvard 's not alone .
she was passionate about that goal and she was clear that she would let no army , no obstacle , no big institution stand in her way .
passionate clarity : that 's what i think we need to drive change .
passion about the change we want to see in the world , and clarity that we are able to help chart the course .
vote with your small change .

white people own time .
`` we 're past all that . '' '' william faulkner famously said , `` '' the past is never dead . ''
do black people have a future ?
we black people have always been out of time .
i believe the future is what we make it .
i believe the future is what we make it .
ours .
so it 's just like georg cantor said , the recursion continues forever .
so even plus odd gives you odd .
in fact , 15 exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself .
but some verbs are irregular .
growing up , i had a nickname .
like every other human being , i avoided trouble .
do n't argue , do as you 're told .
in sunday school , they taught me do n't confront , do n't argue , even if you 're right , turn the other cheek .
being a coward was not an insult .
we used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother .
what followed that election was terrible violence , rape , and the killing of over 1,000 people .
ten months later , i quit my job . i said i could not stand it anymore .
my friends did not show up .
and suddenly , out of nowhere , the police pounced on me like hungry lions .
i spent that night in a cold cement floor in the jail , and that got me thinking .
the images that i took were just a number to many kenyans .
we traveled , and our general site from our street exhibit became for political graffiti about the situation in the country , talking about corruption , bad leadership .
it has been done in uganda and other countries , and what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media and amplified across the country , across the continent .
i am no longer alone when i stand up to speak about these things .
i belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country , who want to bring about change , and they 're no longer afraid , and they 're no longer smart cowards .
so that was my story .
there are two most powerful days in your life : the day you 're born , and the day you discover why .
so pawa254 : you 've created a studio , a place where young people can go and harness the power of digital media to do some of this action .
so our most powerful tool is art , because we live in a very busy world where people are so busy in their life , and they do n't have time to read .
there 's nothing as powerful as that , knowing that i 'm meant to do this , because you do n't get scared , you just continue living your life .
and that 's going to pose an enormous problem .
half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away .
as we 're moving into cities , the world is also embracing a western diet .
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
is there any way to capture the thought into visual art ?
we see where it 's bouncing , but we do n't see [ them ] as they exist .
so all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses .
now , i passed all my biology exams in britain .
but one thing that i am fairly certain about is , at the very least , what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place .
not yours , of course — other people 's .
and one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater , which was popular in the early part of the 20th century .
tesla , what is 236 multiplied by 501 ?

probably a form of synesthesia .
nt : i needed no models , drawings or experiments .
only then do i construct it .

this is a six-story bespoke home on the island of bali .
it is growing all around us .
there are thousands of pins in each floor .
to succeed at something is often harder than actually making it happen .
i grew up amongst those animals .
i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called londolozi game reserve .
i would take him breakfast in bed , and then , in an old track suit and slippers , he would go for a walk around the garden .
solly was born under a tree 60 kilometers from where i grew up in mozambique .
he then moved across into what we called the habitat team .
it was a hot day , and we found ourselves down by the river .
it pulls me . it turns . i throw my hand up . i 'm able to grab a branch .
( laughter ) solly on the bank sees that i 'm in trouble .
my leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description .
i make an instant decision that i 'll never look at that again .
he comes straight into the channel .
he picks me and puts me on his shoulder .
this is the other thing about solly , he 's freakishly strong .
now — ( applause ) now i do n't know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you , but for solly , it was as natural as breathing .
in a more collective society , we realize from the inside that our own well-being is deeply tied to the well-being of others .
danger is shared . pain is shared .
joy is shared . achievement is shared .
and we would be so excited to be out in the bush and to come across this unusual track .
and it reminded me that even people who grow up in cities feel a natural connection with the natural world and with animals .
the rest of the herd turned and began to follow .
and it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet .
but i just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the oprah show and asked her what the show would be about .
pm : thank you . bv : thank you . thanks very much .
i 'm here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature .
they asked themselves a question : if economics could make such a convincing case for early action on climate change , well why ca n't the same be done for conservation ?
biodiversity , the living fabric of this planet , is not a gas .
we were losing it at an extraordinary rate — in fact , of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth of natural capital .
because the northeastern trade winds , as they go over the amazonas , effectively gather the water vapor .
this rainfall cycle , this rainfall factory , effectively feeds an agricultural economy of the order of 240 billion dollars-worth in latin america .
that 's the economic invisibility of nature .
economics has become the currency of policy .
no matter what level you look at , whether it 's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level , we see the same problem again and again .
at the species level , it 's been estimated that insect-based pollination , bees pollinating fruit and so on , is something like 190 billion dollars-worth .
once again , most of that does n't get paid .
they were the ones that did n't get paid .
a billion people depend on fish for their main source for animal protein .
we did estimates in our study that for countries like brazil , india and indonesia , even though ecosystem services — these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free — they 're not very big in percentage terms of gdp — two , four , eight , 10 , 15 percent — but in these countries , if we measure how much they 're worth to the poor , the answers are more like 45 percent , 75 percent , 90 percent .
that 's the difference .
because these are important benefits for the poor .
how bad can things get ?
the green represents the percentage .
if it 's yellow , it 's 40 to 60 percent .
we tend to constantly ignore public wealth simply because it is in the common wealth , it 's common goods .
so now look at the different lens .
so is this just a story from south thailand ?
in other words , what are the costs of doing business as usual ?
this is not illegal stuff , this is basically business as usual , which causes climate-changing emissions , which have an economic cost .
use of freshwater .
if you drill water to make coke near a village farm , that 's not illegal , but yes , it costs the community .
and a few friends of mine and i decided this does n't make sense .
so we decided to do a massive set of calculations and started producing green accounts for india and its states .
that 's how my interests began and went to the teeb project .
calculating this at the national level is one thing , and it has begun .
it was associated largely with the construction industry .
of course , after the event one can be wise .
if more companies did this , and if more sectors engaged this as sectors , you could have analysts , business analysts , and you could have people like us and consumers and ngos actually look and compare the social performance of companies .
today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace .
the european union ets is the main marketplace .
it 's not doing too well . we 've over-issued .
thankfully , the flux , in other words , the flow of emissions from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa , is more or less balanced .
more of that in a minute .
green carbon , which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions , and blue carbon together comprise 25 percent of our emissions .
we have the means already in our hands , through a structure , through a mechanism , called redd plus — a scheme for the reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation .
will this solve the problem ? will economics solve everything ?
as you can see , they cut across the entire globe all the way from micronesia across indonesia , malaysia , india , madagascar and to the west of the caribbean .
so that 's almost an eighth of society .
we 've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society to not have coral reefs .
because mother nature only has that much in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital .
there are 1 million such schools in india .
now the specifics of the goal do n't matter here , but what matters is how specific the goal is .
but if it does n't or we 're not sure , then let 's put it aside .
but they were not teaching .
not explicitly , but implicitly .
we could train , we could put technology into schools , but the system would n't change .
so , we had the goal and we had the issues , and now we needed to figure out what the solutions were .
what happens is that when a typical ngo comes in , they not only bring in their expertise but they also bring in additional resources .
which basically means giving students things like beads , learning rods , abacuses .
`` and by the way , in order to actually do this activity , here are things that you can use from your immediate environment , whether it be the garden outside or the classroom inside , which can be used as learning aids for kids . '' '' and we see teachers all over haryana using lots of innovative things to be able to teach students . ''
it spreads like wildfire .
you can immediately check who has received it , who has read it .
another teacher from a completely different part of the state will stand up and answer the question .
everybody 's acting as everybody 's peer group , and things are getting implemented .
once a quarter , all students across the state are assessed on their learning outcomes and schools which are doing well are rewarded .
in the context of education , it 's very difficult to see results quickly .
but not in haryana .
but they do n't mean anything if you do n't understand something much more fundamental .
the story starts in kenya in december of 2007 , when there was a disputed presidential election , and in the immediate aftermath of that election , there was an outbreak of ethnic violence .
`` and she quickly said , `` '' it 's too much . ''
`` if only there was a way to automate this . '' '' and two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said , `` '' we could do that , '' '' and in 72 hours , they launched ushahidi . ''
`` ushahidi — the name means `` '' witness '' '' or `` '' testimony '' '' in swahili — is a very simple way of taking reports from the field , whether it 's from the web or , critically , via mobile phones and sms , aggregating it and putting it on a map . ''
now what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .
that is the resource that i 'm talking about .
and it represents the ability of the world 's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large , sometimes global , projects .
now , that free time existed in the 20th century , but we did n't get ushahidi in the 20th century .
the media landscape in the 20th century was very good at helping people consume , and we got , as a result , very good at consuming .
and it 's those two things together — ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large-scale efforts — that are the new design resource .
now i want to stipulate , as the lawyers say , that lolcats are the stupidest possible creative act .
someone who has done something like this , however mediocre and throwaway , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
there is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work , and as anybody who 's worked as an artist or a creator knows , it 's a spectrum you 're constantly struggling to get on top of .
freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything .
even with the sacred printing press , we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals .
so before i talk about what is , i think , the critical difference between lolcats and ushahidi , i want to talk about their shared source .
it is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around , social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us , how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them , or because we 're being paid to do them .
at pick-up time the teachers , who have been with your children all day , would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back .
meanwhile , the parents — perhaps a little busy at work , running late , running errands — want a little slack to pick the kids up late .
`` so gneezy and rustichini said , `` '' how many instances of late pick-ups are there at these 10 daycare centers ? '' '' now they saw — and this is what the graph is , these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals — that there were between six and 10 instances of late pick-ups on average in these 10 daycare centers . ''
and you can see immediately what happened , right ?
the fine broke the culture of the daycare center .
but that 's not right .
so the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you 're relying on the economic part of the bargain — as with the parents paying the teachers — and when you 're relying on the social part of the bargain , when you 're really designing for generosity .
this brings me back to the lolcats and to ushahidi .
both of these rely on cognitive surplus .
it 's value created by the participants for each other .
the goals set out by ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants , but to make life better for everyone in the society in which ushahidi is operating .
it really is going to be a side effect of what we , collectively , make of these kinds of efforts .
what 's going to make the difference here is what dean kamen said , the inventor and entrepreneur .
but we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value .
there is a total vacuum of creative capital in bertie county .
and so this played out for us in a couple different ways .
this is the most complex .
i had deep concerns for the suffering of others and a strong desire to help and bring relief to them .
jihad means to strive to one 's utmost .
i was proud and grateful to be british — i still am .
so i started to question .
i carried on .
and the questions grew .
i met two 13-year-olds with soft manners and gentle voices .
not protecting anyone against invaders or occupiers ; not bringing relief to the oppressed .
and it still carries on today .
and we did not give ourselves a chance to develop a virtuous character .
we told ourselves we were fighting for the oppressed , but these were unwinnable wars .
i got in touch with my soul .
what have i learned ?
but i believe such people can change .
when we ignore the realities , we discover that we accept what we are told without critical reflection .
i endlessly told others to accept the truth , but i failed to give doubt its rightful place .
so i understood the vital importance of self-knowledge , political awareness and the necessity for a deep and wide understanding of our commitments and our actions , how they affect others .
that way we do matter more to ourselves ...
this is jihad — my true jihad .
so i 've decided to recruit some of my ted friends to read my words aloud for me .
i will start with my wife , chaz .
going into the first surgery for a recurrence of salivary cancer in 2006 , i expected to be out of the hospital in time to return to my movie review show , 'ebert and roeper at the movies . ' i had pre-taped enough shows to get me through six weeks of surgery and recuperation .
i saw myself in the mirror and i looked pretty good .
i was using my ipod to play the leonard cohen song 'i 'm your man ' for my doctors and nurses .
there was no particular day when anyone told me i would never speak again ; it just sort of became obvious .
`` i tried out various computer voices that were available online , and for several months i had a british accent , which chaz called sir lawrence . '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' it was the clearest i could find . ''
when it saw a period , it knew how to make a sentence sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air .
but what value do we place on the sound of our own voice ?
at first i was against it .
so we contacted a company in scotland that created personalized computer voices .
they 'd never made one from previously-recorded materials .
so i sent them many hours of recordings of my voice , including several audio commentary tracks that i 'd made for movies on dvds .
the tapes from my tv show were n't very useful because there were too many other kinds of audio involved — movie soundtracks , for example , or gene siskel arguing with me — ( laughter ) and my words often had a particular emphasis that did n't fit into a sentence well enough .
i 'll let you hear a sample of that voice .
these are a few of the comments i recorded for use when chaz and i appeared on the oprah winfrey program .
it still needs improvement , but at least it sounds like me and not like hal 9000 .
when i heard it the first time , it sent chills down my spine .
when i type anything , this voice will speak whatever i type .
the flow is n't natural .
the good people in scotland are still improving my voice , and i 'm optimistic about it .
`` i feel like the hero of that harlan ellison story titled `` '' i have no mouth and i must scream . '' '' on wednesday , david christian explained to us what a tiny instant the human race represents in the time-span of the universe . ''
for almost all of its millions and billions of years , there was no life on earth at all .
when i heard the amazing talk by salman khan on wednesday , about the khan academy website that teaches hundreds of subjects to students all over the world , i had a flashback .
it was about 1960 .
the initials stood for programmed logic for automated teaching operations .
this was a computer-assisted instruction system , which in those days ran on a computer named illiac .
the programmers said it could assist students in their learning .
when i bought my first desktop , it was a dec rainbow .
`` does anybody remember that ? '' '' ( applause ) `` '' the sun times sent me to the cannes film festival with a portable computer the size of a suitcase named the porteram telebubble . ''
for billions of years , the universe evolved completely without notice .
and because of it , i can communicate as well as i ever could .
they give me a way to speak .
while harvesting tissue from both my shoulders , the surgeries left me with back pain and reduced my ability to walk easily .
ironic that my legs are fine , and it 's my shoulders that slow up my walk .
but no you do n't .
one of my twitter friends can type only with his toes .
all of these people are saying , in one way or another , that what you see is not all you get .
because of the rush of human knowledge , because of the digital revolution , i have a voice , and i do not need to scream .
a guy goes into a psychiatrist .
he found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick .
and they passed through you and me .
and they passed through the detector .
you know , it was the payoff of my career , basically .
it 's tough .
`` why are they doing this to us , and why did n't you stop them ? '' '' and i said , `` '' well , you know what ? ''
`` we said , `` '' well , there 's a need for good password data . ''
maybe we can collect some good password data and actually advance the state of the art here .
so the first thing we did is , we got a bag of candy bars and we walked around campus and talked to students , faculty and staff , and asked them for information about their passwords .
`` now we did n't say , `` '' give us your password . '' '' no , we just asked them about their password . ''
does it have a symbol ?
so it turns out there are a lot of people going around stealing passwords , and they often go and post these passwords on the internet .
so this suggests that , instead of telling people that they need to put all these symbols and numbers and crazy things into their passwords , we might be better off just telling people to have long passwords .
now here 's the problem , though : some people had long passwords that actually were n't very strong .
here are some examples .
so we tested password meters that were different sizes , shapes , colors , different words next to them , and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny .
as you type a better password , the bunny dances faster and faster .
what we found was that password meters do work .
he says , in fact , you 've already remembered it .
and so we decided to do a research study to find out whether this was true or not .
if we asked a human to do it , they would pick things that were not very random .
so we tried a few different conditions .
that comes up with something that 's sort of sentence-like .
and then we decided to try something called a pronounceable password .
on the other hand , we did find that pronounceable passwords worked surprisingly well , and so we actually are doing some more research to see if we can make that approach work even better .
they 're the passwords that they created or the computer created for them for our study .
so we talked to the information security office at carnegie mellon and asked them if we could have everybody 's real passwords .
they ran the code .
we got some interesting results , and those of you tepper students in the back will be very interested in this .
so we found that the passwords created by people affiliated with the school of computer science were actually 1.8 times stronger than those affiliated with the business school .
so here are some examples of the difficulty .
`` or `` '' princess . '' '' is that a nickname ? ''
today i wanted to — well , this morning — i want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation ; about how we can cut congestion , pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars ; and how we can do it with the technology that 's in our pockets .
because it turns out there was an uber way before uber .
in 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named lp draper .
well , he was cruising around downtown los angeles , my hometown , and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go .
100 years later .
and so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney .
and car ownership skyrocketed and it 's no wonder that by 2007 , there was a car for every man , woman and child in the united states .
and that phenomenon had gone global .
160 billion dollars in lost productivity , of course also sitting in traffic , and one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint is spewed out in the air by those cars that we 're sitting in .
now , that 's only four percent of our problem though .
that 's the world we live in today .
well , it 's because mass transit has n't yet figured out how to get to everybody 's doorstep .
we saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place .
and the answer , fortunately , is a resounding yes .
and so we rolled it out in los angeles eight months ago .
and in china , well , that could be several million .
so the question for us is : well , how do we turn all of these commuter cars — and literally there 's tens of millions of them — how do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars ?
and we 'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work and it 's a really great thing .
and what if at 60 cents a mile we could get 50 million people carpooling in the united states ?
but technology has given us another opportunity .
ca : you know — i mean the company you 've built is absolutely astounding .
you only just talked about a small part of it here — a powerful part — the idea of turning cars into public transport like that , it 's cool .
tk : sure .
and i think if you know a little bit about our history , it makes a lot more sense .
which is , when we first got started , it was just black cars .
and as we 've gone worldwide and gone from s-classes to auto rickshaws in india , it became something that was important for us to be more accessible , to be more hyperlocal , to be about the cities we were in and that 's what you see with the patterns and colors .
how did it feel like inside the company during that period ?
did you notice a loss of business ?
and i think we learned a lot of lessons but i think at the end of it we came out stronger .
i mean — who are you ?
uberx , when we first started , was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product .
and then the enigma and all of this — i mean , the kind of entrepreneur i am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems .
and the way i like to describe it is it 's kind of like a math professor .
and so at uber we like the hard problems and we like getting excited about those and solving them .
but we do n't want just any math problem , we want the hardest ones that we can possibly find , and we want the one that if you solve it , there 's a little bit of a wow factor .
ca : at the time when self-driving cars are coming — tk : sure , sure , sure . sorry , i missed that .
ca : what do you say to a driver ?
a million people die a year in cars .
but how do we optimistically lead through it ?
but it is a world that 's going to exist , and it is going to be a better world .
ca : travis , what you 're building is absolutely incredible and i 'm hugely grateful to you for coming to ted and sharing so openly .
and so we need a post-conflict compact .
that is not a good idea .
it 's not sustainable .
during conflict people are doing destruction .
another is , you can make ngos accountable .
where would that leave us ?
well , the same is true of the music , which my brother and i composed and mapped specifically for central park .
( music ) i 'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing — that 's us there . that 's both of us actually — specifically about a concept that we 've been developing over the last few years , this idea of location-aware music .
my brother and i were living in new york city when the artists christo and jeanne-claude did their temporary installation , the gates , in central park .
let 's take a closer look .
so using the app , as you make your way towards the grounds surrounding the washington monument , you hear the sounds of instruments warming up , which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron spelling out a very simple melody .
( applause )
so what is a glacier ?
at the end of this hole , we found a huge tunnel going right up the mountain underneath thousands of tons of glacier ice .
i think they 'd make good allies .
watch what 's not .
the couple is always only a man and a woman .
only .
so , same-sex and gender nonconformist couples just disappear .
even within the white-straight- couple-only paradigm — she ca n't be taller , he ca n't be shorter .
a little strange .
this is considered beautiful .
here 's how that looks in slow motion .
and here 's how it looked when we danced it in the opening dance .
so : the waltz .
and it never fails to engage .
but why ?
just be yourself .
tc : jeff and i dance partner dancing all the time with women and men and we love it .
but we dance with a consciousness that this is a historic form that can produce silence and produce invisibility across the spectrum of identity that we enjoy today .
i 've had someone write and say , scientifically speaking , what is the best and fastest way to hide a body ?
there are a few things that i looked at here .
you can also look at square footage and see of the data centers that you know , how big are they ?
how much room is that ?
and for some data centers , you might get two of these pieces of information .
then you can look at the ratios of those numbers , and figure out for a data center where you do n't have that information , you can figure out , but maybe you only have one of those , you know the square footage , then you could figure out well , maybe the power is proportional .
it 's sort of circling around the number you 're trying to get .
and this is a lot of fun .
the math is not all that advanced , and really it 's like nothing more than solving a sudoku puzzle .
so what i did , i went through all of this information , spent a day or two researching .
that gives you an idea of where they have people .
sometimes , when people visit a data center , they 'll take a cell-cam photo and post it , and they are n't supposed to , but you can learn things about their hardware that way .
and in fact , you can just look at pizza delivery drivers .
so i came up with this estimate , and this is a staggering amount of data .
it 's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has , as far as we know .
so this is impractical , but i think that 's about the best answer i could come up with .
what i love is that it lets you take some things that you know , and just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper , find out something that you did n't know that 's very surprising .
`` this is a question i got from a reader , an anonymous reader , and the subject line just said , `` '' urgent , '' '' and this was the entire email : `` '' if people had wheels and could fly , how would we differentiate them from airplanes ? '' '' urgent . ( laughter ) and i think there are some questions that math just can not answer . ''
the human being is compassion because what is our brain for ?
salaam alaikum .
i am in charge of making this country 's food secure .
and of course , most of you have had three meals today , and probably will continue to have after this event .
so going in , what was qatar in the 1940s ?
and you can see that life expectancy was also short .
so let 's move to chapter two : the oil era .
you might find this strange , but in my family we have different accents .
this is probably the skyline that most of you know about doha .
from having no water whatsoever to consuming water to the highest degree , higher than any other nation .
i do n't know if this was a reaction to lack of water .
now that is historic . it 's never happened before in history .
but of course , with the use of technology .
it is that thing that we pump out of the ground , we burn tons of , probably most of you used it coming to doha .
this is the best technology that this region could ever have : desalination .
we 've turned seven billion only a few months ago .
by elevating to a higher socio-economic level , they also change their diet .
on the other hand , there is declining yields because of climate change and because of other factors .
is there a sustainable solution ?
and we will probably put 1,800 megawatts of solar systems to produce 3.5 million cubic meters of water .
within two years we should hopefully be done with this plan and taking it to implementation .
our objective is to be a millennium city , just like many millennium cities around : istanbul , rome , london , paris , damascus , cairo .
we are only 60 years old , but we want to live forever as a city , to live in peace .
they have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of gaddafi .
after a period of 33 years in exile , i went back to libya , and with unique enthusiasm , i started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
with an amazing group of women , i co-founded the libyan women 's platform for peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
( applause ) however , bit by bit , the euphoria of the elections , and of the revolution as a whole , was fading out — for every day we were waking up to the news of violence .
on another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the american ambassador and the attack on the consulate . on another day we wake up to the news
for peace has an alchemy , and this alchemy is about the intertwining , the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives .
let 's talk about the state .
so 25 years ago , then , i was working at cern .
there was a lot of concern that people did n't want to pick it up because it would be too complicated .
also , lots of things which are less visible .
the healthcare , late at night when they 're worried about what sort of cancer somebody they care about might have , when they just talk across the internet to somebody who they care about very much in another country .
it does n't matter who we are .
and then we join these big social networking companies which are in fact effectively built as silos , so that it 's much easier to talk to somebody in the same social network than it is to talk to somebody in a different one , so in fact we 're sometimes limiting ourselves .
and we also have , if you 've read the book about the filter bubble , the filter bubble phenomenon is that we love to use machines which help us find stuff we like .
thank you .
until someone notices me , and i just panic .
`` and the person walks up to me , and says , `` '' hi , my name is so-and-so . ''
`` and what is your name ? '' '' and i 'm just quiet , unable to respond . ''
i was going to work on the second one next .
it felt like i had finally arrived .
`` i hit `` '' refresh . '' '' ( video ) comment : his voice is annoying . no offense . ''
( video ) comment : could you remake this without peanut butter in your mouth ?
i 've stuttered for as long as i can remember .
i spent a lot of time in the bathroom .
that joke never got old .
so i mostly stayed quiet .
every time i record audio , i fumble my way through saying each sentence many , many times , and then i go back in and pick the ones where i think i suck the least .
but after the comments on the video , it no longer made me feel normal .
for example , the sea is described as wine red , people 's faces are sometimes green and sheep are purple .
if you look at all of the ancient literature — ancient chinese , icelandic , greek , indian and even the original hebrew bible — they all mention very few colors .
so basically , if you can make a color , only then can you see it .
so until then , even though a color might be all around them , they simply did not have the ability to see it .
it was invisible .
and we know that resumes with white-sounding names get more callbacks than resumes with black-sounding names .
why is that ?
because of our expectations of what is normal .
( audio ) ag : most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
now , veteran officers and psychologists train new officers .
how can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology into a simple , hand-held , single diagnostic assay ?
this is a picornavirus .
this is all irb-approved , by the way ; they got paid .
the genetic relationships are very close there . that 's a lot of fun .
they did a ct scan .
i mean , they went to the max for this woman .
after extensive research and testing of different materials like rubber , which i realized was too thick to be worn snugly on the bottom of the foot , i decided to print a film sensor with electrically conductive pressure-sensitive ink particles .
we faced many challenges .
art was part of the answer , and my name , in the very beginning , was linked with two things : demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back , and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city .
rather , it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget i had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something .
he screeched that he would block the financing .
`` `` '' because the colors you have ordered do not meet european standards , '' '' he replied . ''
( applause ) so it 's time for change .
the pride of people about their own place of living , and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal , barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space .
thirty-seven said no , we do n't like it .
but to the second question , half of them that did n't like it , they wanted it to continue . ( laughter ) so we noticed change .
one day i remember walking along a street that had just been colored , and where we were in the process of planting trees , when i saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop .
`` `` '' why did you throw away the shutters ? '' '' i asked him . ''
`` `` safer ? why ? they have posted more policemen here ? '' ''
`` you can see it for yourself . there are colors , streetlights , new pavement with no potholes , trees . so it 's beautiful ; it 's safe . '' '' and indeed , it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected . ''
we demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings all over the city , up to eight stories high , the tallest of them .
we established a green tax , and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly .
international organizations have invested a lot in albania during these 20 years , not all of it well spent .
the reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole , and , on the other hand , a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe .
we created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes .
we put the citizen first , and not the clerks .
politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians , while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation .
politics is not just about leaders .
we can all change the world .
( applause )
and so i bought a building .
i was actually just wanting to activate these buildings as much as i could with whatever and whoever would join me .
that would be awesome .
and so we just started imagining , what else could happen in this building ?
tg : i believe that beauty is a basic service .
you have to act it out .
but after seeing what i 've seen , the truth is , they have not disappeared at all .
and , i do n't know , i kind of get a kick out of that a little bit .
i was young when i started . i was younger than a lot of the people i was dancing with .
♫ we 're ready to fly ! ♫ ( applause ) thank you very much . ( applause )
as someone who wonders if maslow got it wrong , i find this choice to prioritize spiritual needs deeply humbling .
for the past few years , i 've been spending my summers in the marine biological laboratory in woods hole , massachusetts .
what i would like to do is ask you to come on a boat ride with me tonight .
this is a jellyfish .
but look closely , and living inside of this animal is another organism that is very likely entirely new to science .
not quite .
from the vantage point of our 21st-century biological laboratories , we have begun to illuminate many mysteries of life with knowledge .
things like cancer , aging , degenerative diseases ; these are but some of the undesirables we wish to tame .
and though i do n't really want to disparage at all the accomplishments of our species , as much as we wish it to be so and often pretend that it is , we are not the measure of all things .
we relentlessly quantify , analyze and compare , and some of this is absolutely invaluable and indeed necessary .
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration recently estimated that about 95 percent of our oceans remain unexplored .
95 percent of our oceans remain unexplored .
so , it 's not surprising that every week in my field we begin to see the addition of more and more new species to this amazing tree of life .
i 'm almost willing to bet that many of you have never heard of the flatworm , schmidtea mediterranea .
seven species , essentially , that have produced for us the brunt of our understanding of biological behavior today .
and that 's because , unfortunately , these seven animals essentially correspond to 0.0009 percent of all of the species that inhabit the planet .
i think we need to renew our spirit of exploration .
so i ask you : are n't we the best chance that life has to know itself ?
thank you .
i 'm here to talk about my own observations about storytelling .
stories make us fall in love .
it 's not uncommon to hear people say that stories make the world a better place .
storytellers are often do-gooders like me and , i suspect , yourselves .
so three — because it 's always got to be three — three reasons why i think that stories do n't necessarily make the world a better place .
but the inverse is also true .
increasingly , we are living in a society where there are larger forces at play , where stories are actually for many people beginning to replace the news .
`` a recent report by the pew center on trends in america indicates that only 10 percent of young adults under the age of 30 `` place a lot of trust in the media . '' ''
now , this is significant .
that 's what pushes the needle forward in terms of social justice .
`` and i think it would be important for audiences to demand more buttons on their favorite websites , buttons for example that say , `` '' if you liked this story , click here to support a cause your storyteller believes in . '' '' or `` '' click here to contribute to your storyteller 's next big idea . '' '' often , we are committed to the platforms , but not necessarily to the storytellers themselves . ''
`` it should look like the future you are dreaming . '' '' storytellers can help us to dream , but it 's up to all of us to have a plan for justice . ''
thank you .
stanford , i majored in ecology and evolution .
the brown administration , and a bunch of my friends , basically leveled the energy efficiency of california , so it 's the same now , 30 years later , even though our economy has gone up 80 percent , per capita .
this year , whole earth catalog has a supplement that i 'll preview today , called whole earth discipline .
subsistence farming is drying up basically .
cable tv , water , the whole gamut , all gets stolen .
so in a town like mumbai , which is half slums , it 's 1/6th of the gdp of india .
famine mostly is a rural event now .
there are things they care about .
and the scale is terrific .
the informal economy , it 's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics : it 's not supposed to be there , but it 's huge .
there 's all kinds of activity .
and one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools .
so the maids and the gardeners and the guards that live in this lively part of town on the left walk to work , in the boring , rich neighborhood .
proximity is amazing .
connectivity between the city and the country is what 's going to keep the country good , because the city has interesting ways of doing things .
and they are regionally separated .
wind and solar ca n't help , because so far we do n't have a way to store that energy .
i want to point out one interesting thing , which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower .
and the innovation is moving very rapidly .
so i think microreactors is going to be important for the future .
my fellow environmentalists , on this subject , have been irrational , anti-scientific , and very harmful .
by the way , this map from 2006 is out of date because it shows africa still under the thumb of greenpeace , and friends of the earth from europe , and they 're finally getting out from under that .
this is a list of them .
because everybody is downstream , downwind of whatever is done .
and if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization .
so this is very interesting diplomacy coming along .
here is an example that climatologists like a lot , one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas .
this one came from the sulfur dioxide from mount pinatubo in 1991 — cooled the earth by half a degree .
there was so much ice in 1992 , the following year , that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs who were known as the pinatubo cubs .
even in the best-resourced countries in the world , this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years .
now when we do that , we discover some startling things about mental illness from a global perspective .
we discover that , for example , mental illnesses are amongst the leading causes of disability around the world .
it is n't surprising , then , that if you should speak to anyone affected by a mental illness , the chances are that you will hear stories of hidden suffering , shame and discrimination in nearly every sector of their lives .
and an especially important challenge that i 've had to face is the great shortage of mental health professionals , such as psychiatrists and psychologists , particularly in the developing world .
any case , i went on , i soldiered on with psychiatry , and found myself training in britain in some of the best hospitals in this country . i was very privileged .
soon after my training , i found myself working first in zimbabwe and then in india , and i was confronted by an altogether new reality .
it became quickly apparent to me that i could n't follow the sorts of mental health care models that i had been trained in , one that relied heavily on specialized , expensive mental health professionals to provide mental health care in countries like india and zimbabwe .
it was then that i came across these books , and in these books i discovered the idea of task shifting in global health .
well today , i 'm very pleased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade , and i want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments , all three of which focused on depression , the most common of all mental illnesses .
similarly , using a randomized control trial in rural pakistan , atif rahman and his colleagues showed that lady health visitors , who are community maternal health workers in pakistan 's health care system , could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers who were depressed , again showing dramatic differences in the recovery rates . roughly 75 percent of mothers recovered as compared to about 45 percent in the comparison villages .
`` what sundar stands for , in hindi , is `` '' attractive . '' '' it seems to me that there are five key lessons that i 've shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting . ''
and importantly , we need to reallocate the few specialists who are available to perform roles such as capacity-building and supervision .
but equally important is because health care has become so incredibly professionalized that it 's become very remote and removed from local communities .
well , i think all of you can guess that 12 years on , we 're still nowhere near that goal .
well to see , let 's imagine we take the hubble space telescope and we turn it around and we move it out to the orbit of mars .
we 'll see something like that , a slightly blurry picture of the earth , because we 're a fairly small telescope out at the orbit of mars .
it 's gotten smaller , it 's got less detail , less resolve .
we can still see the little moon , but let 's go ten times further away again .
here we are at the edge of the solar system , out at the kuiper belt .
but let 's move yet again ten times further away .
here we are out at the oort cloud , outside the solar system , and we 're starting to see the sun move into the field of view and get into where the planet is .
one more time , ten times further away .
all we 're seeing is the big beaming image of the star that 's ten billion times brighter than the planet , which should be in that little red circle .
it would be the same thing if i put my thumb up and blocked that spotlight that 's getting right in my eye , i can see you in the back row .
we build a big screen , we fly it in space , we put it up in front of the star , we block out most of the light , we fly a space telescope in that shadow that 's created , and boom , we get to see planets .
it looks something like that .
it 's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before , and we can see the planets beam out just like that .
it starts wrapped around a hub .
it separates from the telescope .
the petals unfurl , they open up , the telescope turns around .
so those are four petals .
those four petals were built by four undergraduates doing a summer internship at jpl .
those petals have to rotate into place .
the base of those petals has to go to the same place every time to within a tenth of a millimeter .
we ran this test 16 times , and 16 times it went into the exact same place to a tenth of a millimeter .
that 's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars taken with the hubble space telescope .
if we can take a similar space telescope , slightly larger , put it out there , fly an occulter in front of it , what we might see is something like that — that 's a family portrait of our solar system — but not ours .
this is a rubens ' tube . it 's one of many i 've made over the years , and i have one here tonight .
it 's about an 8-foot-long tube of metal , it 's got a hundred or so holes on top , on that side is the speaker , and here is some lab tubing , and it 's connected to this tank of propane .
so let 's change the frequency of the sound , and watch what happens to the fire .
all right , now for some more sound data .
so if we were to render these sounds visually , we might end up with something like this .
this is all 40 minutes of the recording , and right away the algorithm tells us a lot more tricks are missed than are made , and also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely to produce a cheer , and if you look really closely , we can tease out traffic patterns .
so there 's a lot of sentences , so a lot of stars , and after rendering all of the audio , this is what we get .
stephen hawking : there is one , and only one , arrangement in which the pieces make a complete picture .
all right . let me close with a work in progress .
i think , after 30 years , the opportunity exists to create an enhanced version of closed captioning .
all right , so let 's watch this clip again .
so watch closely and see what your eyes can hear .
actually , it 's all just an idea .
and let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions , and so do ideas .
( audience : shopping . ) dm : shopping .
because america is an incredibly rich country .
some of the things we had imagined were beginning to come to fruition , and we were actually seeing this in a clinical context .
`` rather than just making them work with adhesives , let 's integrate them into adhesives , and that could solve our manufacturing problem . '' '' this picture that you see here is our ability to embed these censors inside of a piece of scotch tape by simply peeling it off of a wafer . ''
all of this integrated into the same medical adhesives that are used in the hospital .
and indeed , you can do all of that , if you 're not worried about some of the energy challenges .
that means that we have to be mindful of questions of privacy .
for example , we 've begun to partner with churches and to think about nurses that are church members , that come from that trusted community , as patient advocates and health coaches to people like jane .
thank you .
we were inspired by sylvia earle , who won the ted prize in 2009 .
and now let 's compare that with fish farming .
you can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed , and depending on species , even less .
( applause )
and they paid a lot .
js : oh , [ shiing-shen ] chern .
there it is .
but so often it comes back to save the day .
so , this is called the euler characteristic .
ca : ok , so that 's at least given us a flavor of that amazing mind in there .
let 's talk about renaissance .
so , that may be typical .
but this has been fun .
did you do anything else ?
we need to be at least as serious as we were then .
that 's norway , the richest country in europe . it 's australia . it 's canada .
nigerian newspapers circulations spiked .
( applause )
and then we thought , you know , there are thousands of other talks out there , especially tedx talks , that are popping up all over the world .
and we wanted to do that so we could see how they connected with each other .
but we can also pull up , using speech-to-text translation , we can pull the entire transcript , and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself .
and the meme-ome , you know , quite simply , is the mathematics that underlies an idea , and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it , which i want to share with you now .
so what we 've got here now is the global footprint of all the tedx talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from new york all the way down to little old new zealand in the corner .
and what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these , and we started to see where the connections occurred , where they connected with each other .
so we can take in our network projection and apply a physics engine to this , and the similar talks kind of smash together , and the different ones fly apart , and what we 're left with is something quite beautiful .
they come from the network structure of interconnected ideas . keep going .
sg : absolutely . so i got a little quick on that , but he 's going to slow me down .
but i want to take you into one cluster that 's particularly important to me , and that 's the environment .
and so there 's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here , and i 'll throw to eric for the next part .
let 's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation out of environment , and look at all the talks together .
in the cities cluster , one of the most central was one by mitch joachim about ecological cities , and in the genetics cluster , we have a talk about synthetic biology by craig venter .
and those algorithms , whilst being kind of useful , are also very , very narrow , and we can do better than that , because we can realize that their complexity is not random .
we had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones .
we were going to test-drive it on the street outside of our house in cape town , and it got to midnight and we had n't done that yet .
bj : so we got a camera , and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances .
you can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there .
the first one is called advanced bio-extracts limited .
and what i 've found is that the process of designing and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways .
adding some intelligence with a microcontroller .
so now that we developed these tools and found these materials that let us do these things , we started to realize that , essentially , anything that we can do with paper , anything that we can do with a piece of paper and a pen we can now do with electronics .
so the next project that i want to show you is kind of a deeper exploration of that possibility .
well , this is about state budgets .
state budgets are big , big money — i 'll show you the numbers — and they get very little scrutiny .
many of the people involved have special interests or short-term interests that get them not thinking about what the implications of the trends are .
and these budgets are the key for our future ; they 're the key for our kids .
u.s. economy is big — 14.7 trillion .
well what are we taking in ?
simple business question .
receipts go down , some spending programs go up , but most of it is not because of that .
there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more revenue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
this is what you see at this overall level .
when jerry brown was elected , this was the challenge that was put to him .
now he 's put together some thoughts : about half of that he 'll cut , another half , perhaps in a very complex set of steps , taxes will be approved .
but even so , as you go out into those future years , various pension costs , health costs go up enough , and the revenue does not go up enough .
well , some really nice little tricks .
it 's got holes .
and california 's not unique .
so it 's systemic across the entire country .
three million set aside , 62 billion dollar liability — much worse than the car companies .
and everybody looked at that and knew that that was headed toward a huge problem .
if you do n't change that revenue picture , if you do n't solve what you 're doing in health care , you 're going to be deinvesting in the young .
and unfortunately , as you get into that , people get confused and think , well maybe you think that 's okay .
there 's ways , if it 's temporary , to minimize the impact , but it 's a problem .
well we need money to experiment with that , to get those tools in there .
in a situation where you have growth , you put the new money into this .
so what 's going on ?
no , they wasted their money on this . what about this thing ? — it really is quite phenomenal .
we can get some things out on the internet .
i 'm going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture .
we need lots more .
there 's a few good books , one about school spending and where the money comes from — how that 's changed over time , and the challenge .
we need to understand why they 've done the pension accounting the way they have .
but in fact , their work was sort of pushed off .
in fact , the week afterwards , some tax cuts were done that made the situation even worse than their assumptions .
but we have to draw those people in , because this is about education .
and that 's the kind of thing — the investment in the young — that makes us great , allows us to contribute .
it allows us to do the art , the biotechnology , the software and all those magic things .
thank you .
it was april , last year .
it started out as a cathartic exercise .
and yet sexual assault is not something new .
let us hold people to account , without descending into a culture that thrives off shaming and injustice ourselves .
and if we allow social media to deliver that , then it can deliver a very powerful form of justice , indeed .
the murder happened a little over 21 years ago , january the 18th , 1991 , in a small bedroom community of lynwood , california , just a few miles southeast of los angeles .
`` and as the father was administering these instructions , a car drove by , slowly , and just after it passed the father and the teenagers , a hand went out from the front passenger window , and — `` '' bam , bam ! '' '' — killing the father . ''
and the car sped off .
the police , investigating officers , were amazingly efficient .
the picture that we best can determine was probably the one that they were shown in the photo array is in your bottom left hand corner of these mug shots .
he was convicted . he was sentenced to life imprisonment , and transported to folsom prison .
and mr. carrillo 's alibi ?
first of all , we have all the statistical analyses from the innocence project work , where we know that we have , what , 250 , 280 documented cases now where people have been wrongfully convicted and subsequently exonerated , some from death row , on the basis of later dna analysis , and you know that over three quarters of all of those cases of exoneration involved only eyewitness identification testimony during the trial that convicted them .
we know that eyewitness identifications are fallible .
below awareness , with no requirement for any kind of motivated processing , the brain fills in information that was not there , not originally stored , from inference , from speculation , from sources of information that came to you , as the observer , after the observation .
but it happens without awareness such that you do n't , are n't even cognizant of it occurring .
but also because i have expertise and testify about the nature of human night vision .
well , when you read through the case materials in this carrillo case , one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good at the crime scene , at the shooting .
so when i did the calculations for the lunar data and the solar data at that location on earth at the time of the incident of the shooting , all right , it was well past the end of civil twilight and there was no moon up that night .
so all the light in this area from the sun and the moon is what you see on the screen right here .
the only lighting in that area had to come from artificial sources , and that 's where i go out and i do the actual reconstruction of the scene with photometers , with various measures of illumination and various other measures of color perception , along with special cameras and high-speed film , right ?
no one 's going to call this well-lit , good lighting , and in fact , as nice as these pictures are , and the reason we take them is i knew i was going to have to testify in court , and a picture is worth more than a thousand words when you 're trying to communicate numbers , abstract concepts like lux , the international measurement of illumination , the ishihara color perception test values .
which means there would be very little resolution , what we call boundary or edge detection , and that furthermore , because the eyes would have been totally dilated under this light , the depth of field , the distance at which you can focus and see details , would have been less than 18 inches away .
`` and here i became a bit audacious , and i turned and i asked the judge , i said , `` '' your honor , i think you should go out and look at the scene yourself . '' '' now i may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request — ( laughter ) — but nonetheless , it 's to this man 's credit and his courage that he said , `` '' yes , i will . '' '' a shocker in american jurisprudence . ''
he was totally stoic . i could n't see a twitch of his eyebrow .
`` with a black object and point it right at you , and you can look at it as long as you want . '' '' and that 's what he saw . ( laughter ) you 'll notice , which was also in my test report , all the dominant lighting is coming from the north side , which means that the shooter 's face would have been photo-occluded . it would have been backlit . ''
he is now a freed man . ( applause ) ( applause ) this is him embracing his grandmother-in-law .
he — his girlfriend was pregnant when he went to trial , right ? and she had a little baby boy .
first of all , there 's a long history of antipathy between science and the law in american jurisprudence .
think about how we select our judges in this country .
it 's permeable .
( music ) this species truly has made a remarkable comeback .
( music )
they still have old blackboards and whatnot .
and there are about 300 kids in this school , and the school 's been going now for four years , and they 're about to graduate their first class .
twenty-two people are graduating , and all 22 are going to college .
no slouching , no pants hanging down , none of that stuff .
( laughter ) and this young man , his name is — his last name cruz — he loved it . that 's all over his facebook page and it 's gone viral . ( laughter )
no , we 're having a little fun .
when i get six- and seven-year-olds in a group , i have to figure out how to keep them quiet .
`` do you understand ? '' '' `` uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh . `` `` let 's practice . everybody start chatting . '' ''
try it with your kids . see if it works . ( laughter ) i do n't think so .
because for the majority of my adult life , i worked with young kids , teenagers with guns , i call them .
and we would bring them into the army , and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure , put them in ranks , make them all wear the same clothes , cut all their hair off so they look alike , make sure that they are standing in ranks .
`` once that structure is developed , once they understand the reason for something , once they understand , `` '' mama ai n't here , son . ''
i 'm your worst nightmare . i 'm your daddy and your mommy .
yeah , and then when i ask you a question , there are only three possible answers : yes , sir ; no , sir ; and no excuse , sir .
but you 'd be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure .
they come to respect him .
and so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children .
but the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child 's heart and soul to begin with .
`` no , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother 's arms looks up at the mother and says , `` '' oh , this must be my mother . ''
that 's when language begins .
`` and we 're going to read to you . '' '' a child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school . ''
mind your manners ! mind your adults ! mind what you 're saying !
and that 's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school .
the education process begins even before the child is born , and if you do n't do that , you 're going to have difficulty .
and by the third grade , the kids who did n't have that structure and minding in the beginning start to realize they 're behind , and what do they do ?
if you 're not at the right reading level at third grade , you are a candidate for jail at age 18 , and we have the highest incarceration rate because we 're not getting our kids the proper start in life .
the gift of a good start . every child ought to have a good start in life .
i was privileged to have that kind of good start .
i was not a great student .
i wanted it when i was writing my first book .
and then i found rotc .
but it begins with the gift of a good start .
if we do n't give that gift to each and every one of our kids , if we do n't invest at the earliest age , we 're going to be running into difficulties .
but what they did was keep us in play .
and they did n't care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general , and they never expected any generals in the family , as long as you got an education and then you got a job .
`` and then you can support us . that 's the role of you guys . '' '' and so , it 's so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families , all families . ''
we 're investing in our future .
those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority .
one of the great stories i love to tell is about my love of going to my hometown of new york and walking up park avenue on a beautiful day and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world .
got ta have a dirty water dog . ( laughter ) and no matter where i am or what i 'm doing , i 've got to do that .
i even did it when i was secretary of state .
i 've got no bodyguards , i 've got no police cars . i 've got nothing .
i did it just last week . it was on a tuesday evening down by columbus circle .
and the scene repeats itself so often .
`` you 're , well , you 're general powell . '' '' `` yes , yes . `` `` oh ... `` i hand him the money . ''
rm : it 's adaptable and remixable .
i also think that people love chicago more because the flag is so cool .
in fact , country flags , they tend to behave .
105 entries were received .
and there 's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating .
they play the little high school kid games with each other .
i was n't impulsive , i did n't react right away , because i know this is their house .
i have no wins .
growing up , i was always a good , smart kid .
haiti was a game changer .
for those of us on the ground in those early days , it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans that haiti was something different .
but haiti provided us with something else unprecedented .
this was a situation that traditional aid agencies had never before encountered .
never having been confronted with this type of situation before , we wanted to try and understand how we could tap into this incredible resource , how we could really leverage this incredible use of mobile technology and sms technology .
out of this rubble of haiti and from this devastation came something that we call tera — the trilogy emergency response application — which has been used to support the aid effort ever since .
it has been used to help communities prepare for disasters .
it 's used for public health awareness campaigns such as the prevention of cholera .
but does it work ?
96 percent of them found it useful .
the tera system was developed from haiti with support of engineers in the region .
technology is transformational .
the grassroots has been strengthened through the social power of sharing and they are challenging the old models , the old analog models of control and command .
kibera is one of africa 's largest slums .
it 's on the outskirts of nairobi , the capital city of kenya .
it 's home to an unknown number of people — some say between 250,000 and 1.2 million .
they have collated crowd-sourced data and rendered the invisible visible .
they are telling their own story , bypassing the official narrative .
in mongolia for instance , where 30 percent of the people are nomadic , sms information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns .
my colleague , jason peat , who runs this program , tells me it 's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper than the traditional way of doing things .
we are on a planet of seven billion people , five billion mobile subscriptions .
we are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world where citizens from all cultures and all social strata will have access to smart , fast mobile devices .
a transformation is coming which needs to be understood by the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models .
we need people in our organizations who know what it 's like to work with big data .
it has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters in the humanitarian effort .
( applause )
i find weather extremely fascinating .
so i use sculpture and music to make it , not just visible , but also tactile and audible .
all of my work begins very simple .
i extract information from a specific environment using very low-tech data collecting devices — generally anything i can find in the hardware store .
and from all of these numbers , i start with only two or three variables .
that begins my translation process .
and together , these elements , not only construct the form , but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two-dimensional graph .
when you step closer , you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers .
and musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it .
every single color , dot , every single line , is a weather element .
this is the 1913 trio performing one of my pieces at the milwaukee art museum .
meanwhile , i use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this , that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization , but now they 're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score , so it can actually be read as a musical score .
and i really like that , because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music .
thank you .
( applause )
you 'll find all the gold you want there .
all this became a childhood memory .
the river flowed hot and fast .
they drink its water .
he asked for my intentions and listened carefully .
surprise !
so why does the river boil ?
next time you cross the road , think about this .
it flows hot for 6.24 kilometers .
there you have your hot coffee .
it 's unique .
so , still — how does it work ?
but again , despite all of these studies , all of these discoveries and the legends , a question remains : what is the significance of the boiling river ?
to the shaman and his community , it 's a sacred site .
to me , as a geoscientist , it 's a unique geothermal phenomenon .
we live in an incredible world .
but he did .
actually , i did n't see anyone .
i 've often wondered : what was he thinking ?
he did n't set out to kill or maim me , gill hicks .
and he was n't selective .
alive .
`` ok. '' '' i did n't know alison . ''
but i listened for her check-ins every few minutes .
i did n't know richard .
and i was n't ready for that all to end .
i lowered my breathing rate .
i lived to work .
i see myself as a living fact .
what did i feel ?
how much do you get paid ?
now : how much do you think the person sitting next to you gets paid ?
again , do n't answer out loud .
but admit it — you kind of want to know .
and i think we 're almost there .
this is where that 77 cents on the dollar comes from .
it 's not one size fits all .
and how does that compare to the people you work with ?
( applause )
so let me try to illustrate their findings with an example .
that 's much better than everybody just thinking that you 're the cute girl next door .
now generally , it 's not advisable to just cash in and marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all .
so here 's the example .
you now walk the same path as these early artists .
you become the president of the united states .
no , i do n't think so .
laetitia is one of our young leaders .
i 'm excavating and i 'm trying to maximize the potential and discover as much as i possibly can and exposing it within my own work .
i call that a problem worth solving .
so what are those physics ?
so you 're applying a force on a drill towards the wall .
that 's what i set out to do .
so the mechanism unlocks and the spring retracts the tip .
but it did n't always look like this .
one man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder , nine months old — malek .
a refugee 's stay is supposed to be temporary .
it was their second day , and bassem was getting very weak .
`` and she said to doaa , `` '' please take this child . ''
around them , the bodies were bloating and turning black .
only 11 people survived that wreck , of the 500 .
an egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released .
why was n't there a legal way for her to study in europe ?
the world did this for the vietnamese in the 1970s . why not now ?
and what happens next ?
`` sadly , the frequent overuse of the word `` '' awesome '' '' has now replaced words like `` '' great '' '' and `` '' thank you . '' '' so webster 's dictionary defines the word `` '' awesome '' '' as fear mingled with admiration or reverence , a feeling produced by something majestic . ''
yes , so i think i 'll invent the wheel .
yes , the wheel is awesome !
pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone .
yes , the grand canyon is .
you 're damn right , it was .
oh , hell yeah , sharks are awesome !
speaking up is hard to do .
it was an amazing moment .
but as a negotiations researcher , i insisted he make a counteroffer , and i helped him craft the perfect one .
and through these experiences , i 've come to recognize that each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior .
that 's what happened with my brother .
we get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized .
or we lose that raise or that promotion or that deal .
and there 's one thing that determines that range more than anything else , and that 's your power .
sometimes it 's at work , where someone 's the boss and someone 's the subordinate .
and the key thing is that when we have lots of power , our range is very wide .
but when we lack power , our range narrows .
the low-power double bind happens when , if we do n't speak up , we go unnoticed , but if we do speak up , we get punished .
speaking up is risky , but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up .
that 's when they advocate for others .
when they advocate for others , they discover their own range and expand it in their own mind .
they become more assertive .
and perspective-taking is really simple : it 's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person .
and i want you to draw a capital letter e on your forehead as quickly as possible .
ok , it turns out that we can draw this e in one of two ways , and this was originally designed as a test of perspective-taking .
i 'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an e on their forehead — my former student , erika hall .
and you can see over here , that 's the correct e .
a man walks into a bank in watsonville , california .
he asked for a specific amount of money .
now , imagine you 're a car salesperson , and you want to sell someone a car .
but then my sister-in-law had a brilliant idea .
another way we can earn strong allies , especially in high places , is by asking other people for advice .
but if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments , we are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable .
and three , it still worked !
when we lack power , we do n't have the credibility .
`` i 've had people do this all over the world and i asked them , `` '' what did you notice about the other person when they described their passion ? '' '' and the answers are always the same . ''
`` `` '' they used their hands all over — i had to duck because their hands were coming at me . '' '' `` they talk quickly with a little higher pitch . '' ''
my dad was a psychologist like me , but his real love and his real passion was cinema , like my brother .
so when a scene calls for it , be a ferocious mama bear and a humble advice seeker .
have excellent evidence and strong allies .
`` it was just extraordinary , and when i came back home i found a poem by the mexican poet octavio paz , and decided to set it to music , a piece for choir called `` '' cloudburst , '' '' which is the piece that we 'll perform for you in just a moment . ''
you can see my little video there conducting these people , alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home .
`` two years ago , on this very stage , we premiered virtual choir 2 , 2,052 singers from 58 different countries , this time performing a piece that i had written called `` '' sleep . '' '' and then just last spring we released virtual choir 3 , `` '' water night , '' '' another piece that i had written , this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries . ''
( music ) and when i was speaking to chris about the future of virtual choir and where we might be able to take this , he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could .
`` now , we 'll perform `` '' cloudburst '' '' for you . ''
and you ca n't just draw them arbitrarily .
what paper went into that flap ?
or you could do a moose .
toes have become an origami meme , because everyone 's doing it .
so they need to figure out how , in a computer , to flatten an airbag .
seven years ago , a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company .
and they look nothing like i expected .
i would wake up at 5am , start playing and not stop until i had mastered them .
eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of nintendo , starring me .
but this served me well in college , because i finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline .
and i was proud of that , until a few years ago .
you actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they do n't have any new ideas .
and on the flip side , the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they do n't have original thoughts either .
and sure enough , the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative than the other two groups .
it was agony .
he felt like a failure .
and because the text was n't set in stone , he had freedom to improvise .
there 's a name for it . it 's called vuja de .
( laughter ) vuja de is when you look at something you 've seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes .
but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense .
but guess what ? originals have lots and lots of bad ideas , tons of them , in fact .
even the three icons of classical music — bach , beethoven , mozart — had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces .
they have bad ideas .
those machines have no place for empathy .
in fact , it 's as large as western europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
and so i started to look at what the marketing looked like .
`` they name the condoms things like vive , `` '' to live '' '' or trust . ''
they package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of hiv , put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom .
their marketing is slightly different .
it 's people back home , people that support their work , people like these .
( applause )
this answer took seven minutes , and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for ted .
and i called it the zimbabwe institute of vigital arts .
the different types of writing in africa , first was proto-writing , as illustrated by nsibidi , which is the writing system of a secret society of the ejagham people in southern nigeria .
it 's called sankofa .
this pictograph by the jokwe people of angola tells the story of the creation of the world .
next door , in sierra leone , the mende also developed a syllabary , but theirs reads from right to left .
africa has had a long tradition of design , a well-defined design sensibility , but the problem in africa has been that , especially today , designers in africa struggle with all forms of design because they are more apt to look outward for influence and inspiration .
the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition , is as potent as it has always been , if only designers could look within .
this ethiopic cross illustrates what dr. ron eglash has established : that africa has a lot to contribute to computing and mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals .
africans of antiquity created civilization , and their monuments , which still stand today , are a true testimony of their greatness .
the last word goes to the great jamaican leader marcus mosiah garvey and the akan people of ghana with their adinkra symbol sankofa , which encourages us to go to the past so as to inform our present and build on a future for us and our children .
thank you very much .
road design makes a difference , particularly intersections , of which there are two types : signalized and unsignalized , which means stop signs .
fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections .
but that 's just safety .
what about time and gas ?
this is one in my neighborhood . and they are much better — better than traffic lights , better than four-way stop signs .
so , it 's logical that you 'd have one there , on the minor road entering the major .
but the other two are somewhat questionable .
cars rarely appear on that third road .
that 's just the gasoline cost . there is also pollution , wear on the car , and time .
is $ 20 an hour . that is 60,000 per year .
add that together with the gas , and it 's $ 112,000 per year , just for that sign in each direction .
and you 'd still come out ahead .
because it is saving lives . so , is there a better way to accomplish that goal ?
the answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely .
can that be accomplished with existing signs ?
so , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .
but you all are members of communities , and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows .
and you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle . thank you very much .
her doctor was called alois .
alois did n't know how to help auguste , but he watched over her until , sadly , she passed away in 1906 .
and auguste deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call alzheimer 's disease .
since 1901 , medicine has advanced greatly .
but we 've made essentially no progress at all in treating alzheimer 's disease .
if you 're hoping to live to be 85 or older , your chance of getting alzheimer 's will be almost one in two .
in other words , odds are you 'll spend your golden years either suffering from alzheimer 's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with alzheimer 's .
but we 've done relatively little to address it .
the us government spends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on alzheimer 's despite the fact that alzheimer 's costs us more and causes a similar number of deaths each year as cancer .
but we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an alzheimer 's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease .
remember dr. alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in auguste 's brain a century ago .
there are spots on the paper that are sticky .
but now we 've got together a diverse group of people — medics , biologists , geneticists , chemists , physicists , engineers and mathematicians .
no one outside of our lab has seen these yet .
so these are healthy worms , and you can see they 're moving around normally .
and you can see they 're clearly sick .
today , we see that same drive to beat cancer .
so , it really is down to you .
help speak up for them , and help demand a cure .
and so with this solution , what does this mean for the world ?
thanks .
but after going through this , after realizing , well what just happened ?
so sometimes the databases get so specific .
our school would show bill nye the science guy .
it was an astronomy book , and i poured over that thing for hours on end , and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream , and part of that dream was , i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft .
we go from this view out to the stars .
we have n't included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites .
if we did , it would be a complete mess , because there 's a lot of stuff out there .
and the cool thing is , we actually created 3d models for a number of these spacecraft , so if you want to visit any of these , all you need to do is double-click on them .
you can see , there 's saturn , there 's jupiter , and while we 're here , i want to point out something .
it 's actually pretty busy .
here we have juno on its cruise to jupiter , there .
well , a lot of what nasa does is robotic exploration , and we have a lot of spacecraft out there .
granted , we 're not sending humans up at the moment , well at least with our own launch vehicles , but nasa is far from dead , and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there 's so many other things that we 're doing .
you can see how it 's tilted at about 89 degrees .
so now we 've gone back in time .
now , there 's a funny thing going on here .
it 's actually running at real rate right now , one second per second , and in fact , voyager 1 here is flying by titan at i think it 's 38,000 miles per hour .
but to make it more interesting , i 'm going to speed up time , and we can watch as voyager 1 flies by titan , which is a hazy moon of saturn .
and i 'm going to recenter the camera on saturn , here .
i 'm going to pull out , and i want to show you voyager 1 as it flies by saturn .
with a 3d visualization like this , we can not only just say voyager 1 flew by saturn .
if you want to pause it , you can pause it .
now , what happens is , as it flies underneath saturn , saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system , so if i just keep letting this go , you can see voyager 1 fly up like that .
right there , above , way above the solar system , way beyond our solar system .
`` you know , the theme today is `` '' the world in your grasp . '' '' well , we 're trying to give you the solar system in your grasp — ( laughter ) — and we hope once it 's there , you 'll be able to learn for yourself what we 've done out there , and what we 're about to do . ''
thank you . ( applause )
you order an airline ticket ; you end up in timbuktu .
female voice : why do n't you try saying something encouraging to cheer milo up .
then i have been walking east for 20 years — from eastern europe to central asia — through the caucasus mountains , middle east , north africa , russia .
this is why i went to afghanistan .
and the afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport .
but he gave me a cup of tea .
i heard prayers of the sufi — humble muslims , hated by the taliban .
these are opium-addicted people on the roofs of kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
what do we know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in balkh ?
my aim is to give a voice to the silent people , to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game , the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict .
the reason is n't hard to understand .
this is aliso canyon .
well , what about india ?
during a year , a single plant can provide power 92 percent of the time .
in 1975 , i met in florence a professor , carlo pedretti , my former professor of art history , and today a world-renowned scholar of leonardo da vinci .
well , this time , we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the hall of the 500 was before the remodeling , and the so-called sala grande , which was built in 1494 , and to find out the original doors , windows , and in order to do that , we first created a 3d model , and then , with thermography , we went on to discover hidden windows . these are the original windows of the hall of the sala grande . we also found out about the height of the ceiling , and we managed to reconstruct , therefore , all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came vasari ,
and so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap .
well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . many political reasons .
so i decided to go back to my alma mater , and , at the university of california , san diego , and i proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage .
well , we were confined though , limited , i should rather say , for several reasons that it 's not worth explaining , to endoscopy only , of the many other options we had , and with a 4mm camera attached to it , we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color , black color , and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams , xrf , x-ray diffraction , and the results are very positive so far . it seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments , and since we know for sure
`` for example , the `` '' lady with the unicorn , '' '' another painting by rafael , well , you see the unicorn . ''
so that was a good result . sometimes , it 's not that good , and so , again , authenticity and science could go together and change the way , not attributions being made , but at least lay the ground for a more objective , or , i should rather say , less subjective attribution , as it is done today .
`` but i would say the discovery that really caught my imagination , my admiration , is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer , brown layer , of `` '' the adoration of the magi . '' '' here you see a handmade setting xyz scanner with an infrared camera put on it , and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath . ''
this was an epiphany . we came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by leonardo da vinci , which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see , so thanks only to technology .
okay ? and i will just click on it , we pause , and now let me turn to you so the moment the image , or , i should say , the camera , has locked in the painting , then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded . and so , see .
we can , as we said , we can zoom in . then we can scroll .
well , our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the renaissance , create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together .
i do n't think we quite won this war yet , and i do n't think anyone here will question that .
and again , the same story .
ehud is going into his third treatment , and then his fourth treatment .
and i started looking more and more into this .
it 's not just the best doctors could offer patients with brain cancer generally .
i picked up one of those statistics , and i 'm sure some of you have seen those statistics before .
this is going to show you here how many patients actually died of cancer , in this case females in the united states , ever since the 1930s .
you 'll see a few changes , though .
you 'll see lung cancer , for example , on the rise .
i do n't want to miniaturize the progress and everything that 's been done in cancer research .
now , this is a really a wonderful technology .
you see , those small little hot spots there .
can anyone guess how many cancer cells are in any one of these tumors ?
so we 're going to play a little experiment here .
`` and so i remember talking to a few friends of mine in the lab , and we say , `` '' boy , there 's got to be a better way . '' '' but not just like you tell a friend that there 's got to be a better way . ''
we said , hey , how about instead of using sugar molecules , let 's maybe take tiny , tiny little particles made of gold , and let 's program them with some interesting chemistry around them .
so i 'm going to show you an example now .
and so this tumor is now growing in this mouse 's brain , and then we 've taken a doctor and asked the doctor to please operate on the mouse as if that was a patient , and take out piece by piece out of the tumor .
in fact , the reason why 80 to 90 percent of those brain cancer surgeries ultimately fail is because of those small little extra margins that were left positive , those small little leftover tumors that were left there .
( applause )
and they can use that sense to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean .
try and inflate it .
you could abuse it .
so , let 's make it right in our own backyard .
how many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have ?
so , i 'm still a skeptical little kid .
it 's a 27-kilometer tunnel on the border of france and switzerland buried 100 meters underground .
and then , we collide protons quadrillions of times , and we collect this data very slowly , over months and months .
so june 2015 , the lhc is switched back on .
it was n't a very big bump , but it was big enough to make you raise your eyebrow .
this little bump was unique .
events where only two photons hit out detector are very rare .
but one of these options is huge , and it has to do with that long-standing question that bothered me as a tiny little kid , about gravity .
the strength of gravity compared to the other forces of nature ?
it 's almost as though most of gravity has gone missing .
but what if that 's not true ?
if this were true , we would have to expand our standard model of particles to include an extra particle , a hyperdimensional particle of gravity , a special graviton that lives in extra-spatial dimensions .
and very much of what we do is cartography .
let me put it this way : forget about the lhc for a second .
planning is already underway for a 100-kilometer tunnel
( applause )
ms : to learn . hm : to get to know the world .
it also led them to read shorter books .
what 's in the box ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) sound familiar ?
lots of credit card debt , huge environmental footprints , and perhaps not coincidentally , our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years .
i bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less : college — in your dorm , traveling — in a hotel room , camping — rig up basically nothing , maybe a boat .
so i 'm going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
it 's actually a great way to save you some money .
first up : crowd-sourcing my 420 sq . ft. apartment in manhattan with partners mutopo and jovoto.com .
by buying a space that was 420 sq . ft .
we need to think before we buy .
secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
and of course , my own movie theater .
but consider the benefits of an edited life .
would that give me a little more freedom ?
it does n't really matter .

the usual methods of evaluating a habitat have been done by visually counting the numbers of species and the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area .
this is after selective logging .
the static-like sounds that are very low , that you 're going to hear right now .
and that can be seen directly through a microscope , and i 'm going to show you some of this today .
so this little ant that 's crawling here , it 's like it 's in a little willy wonka land .
i want to talk about something really ordinary , just ordinary sand .
we do n't realize it , but it 's actually a record of that entire ecology .
here 's what most of the sand in our world looks like .
and you can see here that that is — that 's sort of vaporized , and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together .
and that 's called a ring agglutinate .
now here 's a grain of sand that is from the moon , and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there .
so what i 've been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look closely and if you look from a different and a new point of view .
we 're literally off the chart .
`` in all fairness , when i started writing this , i thought , `` oh wow , what does my company , what does tudor do ? '' ''
( laughter ) but i 'm also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of design within reach catalogs , so i pretty much know everything there is .
it is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located , of course , at stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design , the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously , the much better access to parking .
after all , the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often , preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls .
( applause ) ( music ) ah yes , a table .
this is affordable and can come home with you and , as such , it can sit on your kitchen counter — it ca n't go in your drawers ; trust me , i found that out the hard way — and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design .
one other thing about it , if you do have one at home , let me tell you one of the features you may not know : when you fall asleep , it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep .
unlike the theme building , this is not alien technology .
( laughter ) and you did n't even notice it happened .
so imagine , you 're in the supermarket , you 're buying some groceries , and you get given the option for a plastic or a paper shopping bag .
okay , let 's think of why .
but how do we know if we 're actually reducing the net environmental impacts that our actions as individuals and as professionals and as a society are actually having on the natural environment ?
and through doing this , we 've learned some absolutely fascinating things .
allow me to explain .
those same molecules , they become methane , and methane is a 25 times more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
i 'm a product designer by trade .
and so what happens is , we waste more food .
that 's the latest u.n. stats . up to half of the food .
a little bit , but essentially they 're still big boxes , cold boxes that we store stuff in .
but that 's really big in the u.k .
ninety-seven percent of households in the united kingdom own an electric tea kettle .
one 's a boiling chamber , and one 's the water holder .
they have so much locked up inside them .
these kinds of products are everywhere .
everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult .
teaching and learning should bring joy .
there 's restricted economic activity .
but i think it 's a false choice .
in the new world , migration is not going to go away .
man 2 : okay glass , hang out with the flying club .
man 4 : you ready ? you ready ? ( barking ) woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , take a picture .
man 7 : after this bridge , first exit .
google glass : อร่อยman 9 : mmm , อร่อย .
should it be by just walking around looking down ?
in addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you 're out and about looking at your phone , it 's kind of , is this what you 're meant to do with your body ?
you 're standing around there and you 're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass .
my vision when we started google 15 years ago was that eventually you would n't have to have a search query at all .
it was like cell phones strapped to your head .
our original prototypes did n't have cameras at all , but it 's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family , my kids .
and with this , i know i will get certain messages if i really need them , but i do n't have to be checking them all the time .
this is not sustainable .
living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world , through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism .
so , i 'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture .
i 'm working with architect neil spiller at the bartlett school of architecture , and we 're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach .
so , martin , he works with a system called the protocell .
if you walk around the city of oxford , where we are today , and have a look at the brickwork , which i 've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days , you 'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone .
it looks beautiful .
maybe they could extract carbon dioxide .
so we 've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we 're working with to sustainably reclaim venice .
and architect christian kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city .
we 're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this .
we do n't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals .
what we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles .
so , you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light , toward the dark foundations .
now , this is n't going to happen tomorrow . it 's going to take a while .
it 's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case-by-case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of venice .
also it will attract the local marine ecology , who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture .
but perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere .
so , in summary , i 'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to victorian technologies , and building architectures from a bottom-up approach .
there 's only one person i know here , and that 's me .
it 's their creation . it 's their huli creation .
so here are my four sentences then .
thank you .
this is a recent comic strip from the los angeles times .
he 's almost like the banksy of the internet .
it 's actually managed by the network .
and that 's showing you that people are actually placing trust in technology , and it 's started to trump and disrupt and interrogate traditional institutions and how we think about currencies and money .
and this is a global survey , so these numbers are global .
so you think about loyalty .
and i 'll get you back to tide , the detergent now , as i promised .
it 's 50 percent above the category average .
it 's infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals , so it smells very luxurious and very distinctive , and , being a procter and gamble brand , it 's been supported by a lot of mass media advertising .
so nike is literally acting as a well-being partner , a health and fitness partner and service provider .
and you think , corporations should start taking their assets and thinking of them in a different way and trading them .
and you think , is it much of a leap ?
there were 8,000 kinds of notes in america .
are we decoupling money from the government ?
you know , you think about , brands are starting to fill the gaps .
this is my wife and collaborator , rupal .
so i 'm going to talk about trust , and i 'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust .
i think these are so commonplace , they 've become clichés of our society .
and i think there are three .
one 's a claim : there has been a great decline in trust , very widely believed .
i do n't have an overview .
what else can they record ?
so they 're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions .
`` do you trust elementary school teachers ? '' '' you would probably begin by saying , `` '' to do what ? '' '' and that would be a perfectly sensible response . ''
`` and you might say , when you understood the answer to that , `` well , i trust some of them , but not others . '' ''
that 's a perfectly rational thing .
in short , in our real lives , we seek to place trust in a differentiated way .
i might , after all , know that she was n't a good driver .
secondly , what about the aim ?
the aim is to have more trust .
it 's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects .
and , of course , it 's difficult .
it is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks , like midwives , from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes , as we say .
so so much for the aim .
well , we can do that for ourselves .
but trust , in the end , is distinctive because it 's given by other people .
you ca n't rebuild what other people give you .
so you have to , i think , be trustworthy .
how to do it ?
let me give you a simple commercial example .
i think there 's a big lesson in that .
so in the end , i think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern .
now , i can do that to a legal thing .
i can do whatever i want to my book or my car .
right now , all nonhuman animals are legal things .
tommy was a chimpanzee . we found him in that cage .
and we found hercules and leo .
this is a long-term strategic litigation campaign . we shall .
thank you .
that also means you 're probably going to end up with an earful of paint , because i need to paint your ear on your ear .
this is just a photo of one of my three-dimensional paintings .
you might be wondering how i came up with this idea of turning people into paintings .
i also wanted to paint the highlights and create a mapping on his body in greyscale .
i had a very specific vision of what this would look like , and as i was painting him , i made sure to follow that very closely .
i had turned my friend into a painting .
i had no idea where to begin .
it was about space and light .
it 's nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg .
i came together with a collaborator , sheila vand , and we had the idea of creating paintings in a more unusual surface , and that was milk .
sometimes , when sheila would lay down in the milk , it would wash all the paint off of her arms , and it might seem a little bit clumsy , but our solution would be , okay , hide your arms .
and one time , she got so much milk in her hair that it just smeared all the paint off of her face .
( applause )
and i looked like this .
this is a trick .
that 's how we end up with buildings like this .
this library is about how we consume media in a digital age .
that 's because there 's never been a good feedback loop in architecture .
and it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature instead of the other way around .
thank you .
and so many of these diseases , like asthma and certain kinds of cancers , are on the increase around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped .
and we 've talked a lot about that .
we are surrounded by the most amazing people who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible .
we are learning from them .
hi .
so my day-to-day definition of mathematics that i use every day is the following : first of all , it 's about finding patterns .
we 're going to do that very soon .
`` here it says the word `` '' mathematics . '' '' but actually , they 're just dots , right ? ''
perhaps if i copy it and make some art ?
but think about it : this is an equation .
one perspective is , it 's a sum .
this thing on the left-hand side is -1 , and the other one is .
it 's written like this .
i like this one , because this says four divided by three .
and this number expresses a relation between two numbers .
i 'm just viewing a number from another perspective .
i can even do this with rhythms , right ?
i can do it even one more time .
what happens ?
we can go to the beach .
so all of these are different perspectives .
and this is the best one .
it makes you open to new things , and it makes you able to understand things .
shaheen 's background i do n't even know .
where does their journey begin ?
you have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked .
can you ply your mind for that one way that you can respond to the problem ?
they are also part of this world .
sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
it 's never going to convince anybody to do something that they do n't want to do .
well , beforehand , everything is the same .
now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric .
so if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts , they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries .
i think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office , to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices .
`` or `` '' are n't your children suffering because you 're not there all the time ? '' '' and i think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty . ''
( applause )
earn me , learn me , scan me , squint through your lens .
our tragedy is we ca n't see it .
`` `` this dark hour '' late summer , 4 a.m . ''
we cleared tons and tons of stinking , rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant .
i was helping clean the onsen , the communal onsen , the huge giant bathtubs .
this happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos .
as i looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the envelope from the processing lab , i could n't help but think as a retoucher that i could fix that tear and mend that scratch , and i knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
so that evening , i just reached out on facebook and asked a few of them , and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive , i knew we had to give it a go .
this was the very first .
not terribly damaged , but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl 's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy .
once a week , we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up , where people were reclaiming their photos .
it was very time-consuming .
we had an amazing local woman who guided us .
it 's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos .
as my team leader wynne once said , it 's like doing a tattoo on someone .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
she also had duplicates .
the day of the tsunami , he 'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed .
he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded .
the day i gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son 's 14th birthday .
during this time , we had n't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was printer inks .
for some of them , it 's given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin .
so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ?
so in the oasis of intelligentsia that is ted , i stand here before you this evening as an expert in dragging heavy stuff around cold places .
it was a journey , an expedition in antarctica , the coldest , windiest , driest and highest altitude continent on earth .
scott 's team of five died on the return journey .
and for the last decade , i 've been asking myself why that is .
how come this has remained the high-water mark ?
it was as if the marathon record has remained unbroken since 1912 .
our sledges weighed 200 kilos , or 440 pounds each at the start , the same weights that the weakest of scott 's ponies pulled .
living conditions were quite spartan .
we had , before we 'd got to the pole , two weeks of almost permanent headwind , which slowed us down .
you become pathetic .
and i sound like a bit of a fraud standing here now with a sort of belly .
they needed repairing almost every hour .
i 've never felt as small as i did in antarctica .
as i said , there are very few superficial signs that i 've been away .
i 've put on 30 pounds .
a lot of people have asked me , what next ?
there we were , souls and bodies packed into a texas church on the last night of our lives .
`` and just in case he did , i built a backup plan , by reading the `` '' left behind '' '' books that were all the rage at the time . ''
so i held on and i closed my eyes to listen , to wait .
and the shouts of response to the call of the prayer went up higher even still .
but i was upset on their behalf .
but over and over again , midnight struck , and i opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead .
tony told me that he started harlem grown with money from his pension , after 20 years as a cab driver .
and i was there as that help .
i felt the weight of revelation that i could sit in one room on one night , where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars , and another room , two days later , just 50 blocks up the road , where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day .
thank you .
( applause ) ( bells ) ( trumpet ) rachelle garniez : ♫ quand il me prend dans ses bras ♫ ♫ il me parle tout bas , ♫ ♫ je vois la vie en rose . ♫ ♫ il me dit des mots d'amour , ♫ ♫ des mots de tous les jours , ♫ ♫ et ca me fait quelque chose . ♫ ♫ il est entre dans mon coeur ♫ ♫ une part de bonheur ♫ ♫ dont je connais la cause . ♫ ♫ c'est lui pour moi . moi pour lui ♫ ♫ dans la vie , ♫ ♫ il me l'a dit , l'a jure [ pour ] la vie . ♫ ♫ et des que je l'apercois ♫
`` two weeks ago i was in my studio in paris , and the phone rang and i heard , `` '' hey , jr , you won the ted prize 2011 . ''
whatever .
`` ( laughter ) `` that 's cool . '' ''
what about art ?
and at that time , i was not thinking about changing the world .
and i framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising .
i would control it directly with the public in the streets .
because i was just 18 and i was just up there on the top of the champs-elysees .
( laughter ) november 2005 : the streets are burning .
these were criminals , thugs , dangerous , destroying their own environment .
so i went back there with a 28 mm lens .
so i took full portraits of people from le bosquet .
and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name , age , even building number of these guys .
that 's where i realized the power of paper and glue .
a year later , i was listening to all the noise about the middle east conflict .
so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs — taxi-driver , lawyer , cooks .
asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment .
not a smile — that really does n't tell about who you are and what you feel .
`` the army will shoot you , and hamas will kidnap you . '' '' we said , `` '' okay , let 's try and push as far as we can . '' '' i love the way that people will ask me , `` how big will my photo be ? '' ''
so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born .
we 're in ramallah right now .
`` and those ones are actually two taxi-drivers . '' '' and then there was always a silence . ''
( applause ) we even pasted on israeli military towers , and nothing happened .
in the middle east , i experienced my work in places without [ many ] museums .
so we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos .
sometimes there was no words , no sentence , just tears .
most of the places i went to , i decided to go there because i 've heard about it through the media .
three kids — that was three students — were [ detained ] by the army because they were not carrying their papers .
and the army took them , and instead of bringing them to the police station , they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces .
i heard it was one of the most violent favelas , because the largest drug cartel controls it .
`` we need culture out there . '' '' so i went out and i started with the kids . ''
i just took a few photos of the kids , and the next day i came with the posters and we pasted them .
they were all linked to the three kids that got killed .
there was the mother , the grandmother , the best friend — they all wanted to shout the story .
i 'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons .
`` i 've been seeing it around me the last few days . '' '' so that 's a really symbolic pasting , because that 's the first one we did that you could n't see from the city . ''
and then we pasted everywhere — the whole hill .
so how can we know about the project ?
`` they kept asking me , `` '' what is the purpose of your project ? ''
`` do n't you have color in france ? '' '' ( laughter ) or they tell you , `` '' are these people all dead ? '' '' some who understood the project would explain it to others . ''
it becomes a desire , a need , an armor .
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so [ many ] houses inside .
`` `` oh , that guy just moved . '' ''
before i start that , just so you know , each time we go to a place , we do n't have authorization , so we set up like commandos — we 're a group of friends who arrive there , and we try to paste on the walls .
but there are places where you just ca n't paste on a wall .
so we decided to paste white , white on the walls .
so imagine white guys pasting white papers .
but you know how india has a lot of dust in the streets , and the more dust you would have going up in the air , on the white paper you can almost see , but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker .
women are heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities , and the women kept that dynamic after we left .
we did that in most of the places .
a really important point for me is that i do n't use any brand or corporate sponsors .
( applause ) and that is for me one of the more important things in the work .
`` because this can be taken for advertising , and because of the law , it has to be taken down . '' '' but tell me , advertising for what ? ''
and today , they are with you in long beach .
i use man ray , helen levitt , giacomelli , other people 's artwork .
it does n't matter today if it 's your photo or not .
in some ways , art can change the world .
and this starts right now .
so a subject you 're passionate about , a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos — tell me what you stand for .
what we see changes who we are .
so i hope that , together , we 'll create something that the world will remember .
would you believe that watch still works ?
that night began my formal relationship with death — my death — and it also began my long run as a patient .
which is to say , of course , it was badly designed .
now , let me introduce you to frank .
sort of makes this point .
in this way , frank grieves .
they are places for acute trauma and treatable illness .
i remember my nurses complaining about driving through it .
in a hospital , that 's a stolen moment .
the need for food has birthed cuisine .
i know some of you are working on this .
and yet , i 've taken that idea and made it my own .
the talk , the shop talk , the conversation , that is the essence of the black barbershop .
`` `` '' hey rev , '' '' they would say to my dad . ''
`` `` hey young fella , how you doing ? '' ''
`` `` '' did you hear about eddie ? he died last week . ''
you can concretely take action .
where is that place for you where people who are affected by a unique problem can meet a unique solution ?
thank you .
for the last 10 years , i 've been spending my time trying to figure out how and why human beings assemble themselves into social networks .
and the kind of social network i 'm talking about is not the recent online variety , but rather , the kind of social networks that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years , ever since we emerged from the african savannah .
and this spreads on out endlessly into a distance .
but recently , we 've been wondering whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight , to actually find ways to improve the world , to do something better , to actually fix things , not just understand things .
so one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics .
so , so and so patients have been diagnosed with something , or other patients have been diagnosed , and all these data are fed into a central repository , with some delay .
and if everything goes smoothly , one to two weeks from now you 'll know where the epidemic was today .
and actually , about a year or so ago , there was this promulgation of the idea of google flu trends , with respect to the flu , where by looking at people 's searching behavior today , we could know where the flu — what the status of the epidemic was today , what 's the prevalence of the epidemic today .
a kind of a diffusion of innovation could be understood and predicted by the mechanism i 'm going to show you now .
because , as i said , we live our lives in networks , and these networks have a particular kind of a structure .
and the lines represent — the dots are the people , and the lines represent friendship relationships .
and different sorts of things spread across different sorts of ties .
but not all positions in the network are the same .
so if you look at this , you might immediately grasp that different people have different numbers of connections .
`` and this is called the `` '' degree '' '' of a node , or the number of connections that a node has . ''
but if you can see this image [ of the network ] from a bird 's eye view , you can appreciate that there 's something very different about nodes a and b .
so if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information , you would know that , soon enough , everybody was about to contract this germ or this piece of information .
the problem , however , is that mapping human social networks is not always possible .
and if they nominate the party host as their friend , that party host has a hundred friends , therefore , has more friends than they do .
and this , in essence , is what 's known as the friendship paradox .
so , we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks .
the epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left , over here .
now , in addition to that , if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic or to predict the adoption of a product , for example , what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population , also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends and follow both the randoms and the friends .
or you could see the first time the two curves diverged , as shown on the left .
and that , as indicated by the white line , occurred 46 days before the peak of the epidemic .
i should say that how far advanced a notice one might get about something depends on a host of factors .
it could depend on the nature of the pathogen — different pathogens , using this technique , you 'd get different warning — or other phenomena that are spreading , or frankly , on the structure of the human network .
information spreads in populations , norms can spread in populations , behaviors can spread in populations .
and by behaviors , i can mean things like criminal behavior , or voting behavior , or health care behavior , like smoking , or vaccination , or product adoption , or other kinds of behaviors that relate to interpersonal influence .
would you get any population-level immunity ?
and similar ideas can be used , for instance , to target distribution of things like bed nets in the developing world .
this is a map of eight million phone users in a european country .
without actually having to query them at all , we can get this kind of a structural insight .
they 're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data to create sensor networks to follow the population , understand what 's happening in the population , and intervene in the population for the better .
because these new technologies tell us not just who is talking to whom , but where everyone is , and what they 're thinking based on what they 're uploading on the internet , and what they 're buying based on their purchases .
or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors , passively , and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within [ networks of ] doctors .
`` or another example would be , if you 're a phone company , you figure out who 's central in the network and you ask those people , `` '' look , will you just text us your fever every day ? ''
and be able , on a large scale , to monitor an impending epidemic with very minimal input from people .
`` in fact , the availability of these data , i think , heralds a kind of new era of what i and others would like to call `` computational social science . '' ''
and with this science , we can understand how exactly the whole comes to be greater than the sum of its parts .
thank you .
we have the right to respect .
we expect them to pose perfectly .
bad feminism — or really , more inclusive feminism — is a starting point .
and there , i wrote myself back together .
but then i saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health .
but the key here is that it is not tagged as a parkinson 's patient product .
so , well , one problem solved , many more to go .
because in india we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries .
what we need are human-centered solutions .
but why ca n't smart be something that 's simple and yet effective ?
let 's make a smarter world , but with simplicity .
if you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth .
my name is henry evans , and until august 29 , 2002 , i was living my version of the american dream .
i am lucky to have her .
together , we raised four wonderful children .
i became fascinated with using technology to help the severely disabled .
one day , i was lying in bed watching cnn , when i was amazed by professor charlie kemp of the healthcare robotics lab at georgia tech demonstrating a pr2 robot .
i saw new and previously unthinkable possibilities to live and contribute , both for myself and others in my circumstance .
it was then i realized that i could also use an aerial drone to expand the worlds of bedridden people through flight , giving a sense of movement and control that is incredible .
all work and no fun makes for a dull quadriplegic , so we also find time to play friendly games of robot soccer . ( laughter ) i never thought i would be able to casually move around a campus like brown on my own .
( laughter ) are you excited to be at tedxmidatlantic ?
( laughter ) ( applause ) can you show us how excited you are ? ( laughter )
all right , big finish .
( applause ) all right , we still have a little ways to go with that , but i think it shows the promise .
our goal for robotics is to unlock everyone 's mental power by making the world more physically accessible to people such as myself and others like me around the globe .
that 's the tradition of god , the soul and immortality .
but we know that that 's purely syntactical . that 's symbolic .
we know that actual human consciousness has something more than that .
this is perhaps my favorite .
this is again showing all the different contributions .
and other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces .
this is what that sounded like .
daisy bell : ♫ daisy , daisy ... ♫ aaron koblin : and we took all of those individual pieces , and we fed them into another turk request .
recording : ♫ daisy , daisy ♫ ♫ give me your answer do ♫ ♫ i 'm half crazy ♫ ♫ all for the love of you ♫ ♫ it ca n't be a stylish marriage ♫ ♫ i ca n't afford a carriage ♫ ♫ but you 'll look sweet upon the seat ♫ ♫ of a bicycle built for two ♫ ak : so james surowieki has this idea of the wisdom of crowds , that says that a whole bunch of people are smarter than any individual .
so if you go to the bicyclebuiltfortwothousand.com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together .
so basically motion through 3d space .
more recently , somebody even 3d-printed thom yorke 's head , which is a little creepy , but pretty cool .
and we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project .
so we put the idea on the back burner for a few months .
so what we did was cross-cut a bunch of archival footage of johnny cash , and at eight frames a second , we allowed individuals to draw a single frame that would get woven into this dynamically changing music video .
one is the beginning of the music video .
and i just thought it 'd be wonderful , it 'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory .
collaborator four : i 've seen everybody from japan , venezuela , to the states , to knoxville , tennessee .
collaborator six : watching the video in my room , i could see me not understanding at the beginning of it .
if you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails , you can see the person who drew that individual thumbnail and where they were located .
and you can also see the way that it was drawn .
in addition to that , it 's listed , the artist 's name , the location , how long they spent drawing it .
and then this is , again , the abstract version , which ends up getting a little bit crazy .
`` and this is called `` '' the wilderness downtown . '' '' it 's an online music video for the arcade fire . ''
what if we had a very low commitment , but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed ?
thanks a lot .
but thinking about where it all goes is the first step in activating what are actually superpowers in our poop and pee .
just notice what kinds of words and feelings come to mind .
i imagine it might .
`` i mean , i can use profane words like `` '' shit '' '' and `` '' piss , '' '' and then my grandma wo n't watch the video . ''
`` or i can use scientific words like `` '' excrement '' '' and `` '' feces . '' '' humph . ''
this approach is called integrated water management , or holistic or closed-loop .
but in this approach , we 're doing one step better .
why is n't that kind of thing the new normal ?
but innovation is n't always incremental .
it turns out , how we feel about any particular new technique gets into everything we do : how we talk about it , how we encourage people to study , our jokes , our codes ...
and it ultimately determines how innovative we can be .
the second reason is : we think the problem is solved here in the us .
here in the us we still get sick from drinking shit in our sewage water .
number one : we can fertilize our food .
that dark brown poo in the toilet is dark brown because of what ?
and carbon , if we 're getting that into the soil , is going to bind to the other minerals and nutrients in there .
chemical fertilizers by definition do n't have carbon in them .
and get this : if we change our approach to sanitation , we can start to slow down climate change .
when they went to get this permitted , it was n't allowed in oregon .
this was the first permit of its kind in oregon .
but why were all these projects so innovative ?
the money piece , yeah .
but more importantly , they felt comfortable with this idea of advanced potty training .
think about it — solar power used to be uncommon and unaffordable .
it 's us .
if you do n't know , find out .
thank you so much .
stars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust , instigated by gravity 's irrevocable pull .
after graduation , and despite knowing that i wanted a phd in astrophysics , i fell through the cracks .
after receiving my master 's at fisk , i went on to yale to complete my phd .
simply put , we can not be the most excellent expression of our collective genius without the full measure of humanity brought to bear .
and you come here to tell me that i can not keep on living here ?
you ! you are imposing this on me !
did i want to speak in public ?
it 's all job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat , no tears .
for me , my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air .
it is hitting every high note . it is running a marathon .
or , maybe it 's called being a workaholic .
i like that hum . i love that hum .
they were 12 , 3 , and 1 when the hum stopped .
the hum of the engine died .
it was all i did .
and i 'm just about to say no , when i realize two things .
`` and so she says , `` '' momma , wan na play ? '' '' and i say , `` '' yes . '' '' there 's nothing special about it . ''
and i am happy .
and it 's not instantaneous , but it happens , it does happen .
and now i feel like i know a very magical secret .
no magic . no secret . it 's just love .
it 's just something we forgot .
the real hum is singular and original .
we run around the yard , up and back and up and back .
but it is ok .
you have time .
you know why ? because you 're not rihanna and you 're not a muppet .
if i 'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy , i 'm invisible after 15 minutes .
i am that hum .
life 's hum .
work 's hum is still a piece of me , it is just no longer all of me , and i am so grateful .
my brain is still global . my campfires still burn .
the more i feel that hum , the more i know who i am .
wan na play ?
( applause )
well , what exactly is resilience , and how do you develop it ?
one day , i got to present my research to a roomful of mba students .
as i proceeded with my presentation , i could see john in the corner of my eye .
i presented a couple of gender parity indices , and some conclusions about the arab world .
`` what you are doing is dangerous and will break the social fabric of our society . '' '' he paused , then added , `` when women have children , their place is in the home . '' ''
one , that these were his issues , his complexes .
so instead of replying , i gave back one of my largest smiles as i saw , in flashing light , the following sign in my mind 's eye .
things are changing , but it will take time .
to achieve this , i have found the hard way that you need to apply your hard-earned professional skills to your personal life .
just like i would in my business life , i have based the selection of who would support me with my children while i 'm at work on a strong referral .
this lesson applies whatever your childcare situation , whether an au pair , nursery , part-time nanny that you share with someone else .
but this is not just about surviving in your dual role as a career woman and mother .
instead of worrying about how many minutes i can spend with them every day , i focus on turning these minutes into memorable moments , moments where i 'm seeing my kids , hearing them , connecting with them .
the majority of those are also women .
take , for example , sequoia trees .
but here 's the problem : say you want to buy a half a ton of nanocellulose to build a boat or an airplane .
and we produce this mountain every year .
so i 'm sure everybody would like to have that material .
now we have the ability to produce lots of resilin .
well , my team decided to do something really cool at the university .
why collagen ?
so where is the problem ?
actually , it 's happening now .
there , the process of extracting the collagen starts .
this is not science fiction .
by doing that , we 've been able to make a superfiber which is about 380 percent tougher , and 300 percent more elastic .
in the future , we believe we 'll be able to make many nanobio building blocks that nature provided for us — collagen , nanocellulose , resilin and many more .
now , this heart is not going to be the same as we can get from a donor .
it will be better .
this has got to go tomorrow .
i march down hallways cleaned up after me every day by regular janitors , but i never have the decency to honor their names .
this is a training ground .
this is a training ground to sort out the regulars from the honors , a reoccurring cycle built to recycle the trash of this system .
this is a training ground where one group is taught to lead and the other is made to follow .
the need for degrees has left so many people frozen .
they gather together , and they show their joy .
they show their spirit .
ag : thank you . mk : thank you .
tr : thank you so much .
carlos , the vietnam vet marine who volunteered for three tours and got shot up in every one .
now , making war — this is something that we are good at .
we are good at making war .
now , the same holds for training-based treatments .
the first of these treatments is cognitive therapy , and this is a kind of mental recalibration .
which is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life ; there are .
now , at first he was very anxious .
and he wanted to leave , but he did n't .
`` and when i spoke with him a year after treatment had finished , he told me , `` '' doc , this is the first time in 43 years that i have n't had nightmares . '' '' now , this is different than erasing a memory . ''
and there are trust issues .
i see people 's lives transform .
the cave is huge .
what you can find there is really evidence of a lost world .
now we are not there yet , but it is happening .
i live in south central .
this is south los angeles . ( laughter ) liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
i got tired of seeing this happening .
i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
so what i did , i planted a food forest in front of my house .
it 's 150 feet by 10 feet .
the city came down on me , and basically gave me a citation saying that i had to remove my garden , which this citation was turning into a warrant .
`` and i 'm like , `` '' come on , really ? ''
so l.a. times got ahold of it . steve lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman , and one of the green grounds members , they put up a petition on change.org , and with 900 signatures , we were a success .
my councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we 're doing .
they own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
that 's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants .
it 's my gospel , when i 'm telling people , grow your own food .
and i refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people , and i 'm manufacturing my own reality .
gardening is my graffiti . i grow my art .
just like a graffiti artist , where they beautify walls , me , i beautify lawns , parkways .
so what happened ?
you 'd be surprised how kids are affected by this .
this is on the street for a reason .
these are the guys , they helped me unload the truck .
it was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
i see young people and they want to work , but they 're in this thing where they 're caught up — i see kids of color and they 're just on this track that 's designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
so with gardening , i see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
i 'm not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
so what i want to do here , we got ta make this sexy .
but we see the results of this technology , still .
so let 's make a little test .
so everyone of you turns to their neighbor please .
because our dental anatomy is actually made , not for tearing down raw meat from bones or chewing fibrous leaves for hours .
it is made for a diet which is soft , mushy , which is reduced in fibers , which is very easily chewable and digestible .
sounds like fast food , does n't it .
( laughter ) it 's for cooked food .
we carry in our face the proof that cooking , food transformation , made us what we are .
we talk about ourselves as omnivores .
i would say , we should call ourselves coctivors — ( laughter ) from coquere , to cook .
those have to pay tuition fees know .
( laughter ) but it 's also , metabolically speaking , expensive .
it 's very expensive .
where does the energy come from . of course , from food .
now , cooking allowed also that we became a migrant species .
we walked out of africa two times .
it keeps also your brain working .
you can continue to innovate and invent .
think about bittersweet chocolate ; or think about the acidity of yogurt — wonderful — mixed with strawberry fruits .
reward : this is a more complex and especially integrative form of our brain with various different elements — the external states , our internal states , how do we feel , and so on are put together .
so satisfaction was a very important part .
now how did the gut actually participate in this development ?
`` all the managers in the room say , `` '' you do n't tell me something new , because we know , gut feeling . ''
because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system , they do speak with each other and make decisions .
now 150 years ago , anatomists described very , very carefully — here is a model of a wall of a gut .
the gut is actually the largest immune system , defending your body .
if you do n't like a food , especially if you 're a child , you gag .
it 's this brain which makes this reflex .
and then finally , it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery , which actually digests the food we cook .
i took here a model from robotics — it 's called the subsumption architecture .
so if we take two types of signals — a hunger signal for example .
at least in my case , they are not listened to .
the more usual case is overeating .
`` it actually takes the signal and changes it , and we continue , even [ though ] our eight signals would say , `` '' stop , enough . ''
`` we have transferred enough energy . '' '' now the interesting thing is that , along this lower layer — this gut — the signal becomes stronger and stronger if undigested , but digestible , material could penetrate . ''
it 's very difficult to work in the intestine .
now everyone would expect that when the degradation of the oil happens , when the constituents are liberated , they disappear , they go away because they [ were ] absorbed .
we have a coctivor 's opportunity , because we have learned over the last two million years which taste and reward — quite sophisticated to cook — to please ourselves , to satisfy ourselves .
2,800 dollars per species is the average .
after 9/11 , the tables were turned .
you could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago , which was fear .
what does it mean to say that there 's an islamic democracy ?
and if we do , then i do n't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether .
thanks .
its largest recipients were germany and france , and it was only 2.5 percent of their gdp .
that , i think , is movement .
`` and given this , we started getting questions like , `` '' if you can grow human body parts , can you also grow animal products like meat and leather ? '' '' when someone first suggested this to me , quite frankly i thought they were a little crazy , but what i soon came to realize was that this is not so crazy after all . ''
there is another way , because essentially , animal products are just collections of tissues , and right now we breed and raise highly complex animals only to create products that are made of relatively simple tissues .
and we should begin by reimagining leather .
this collagen is the stuff between cells .
and so i 'm very excited to show you , for the first time , the first batch of our cultured leather , fresh from the lab .
this leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet , a handbag or a car seat .
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today .
rather , it could be much more like this .
already , we have been manufacturing with cell cultures for thousands of years , beginning with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it is where cell culture takes place .
it 's clean , open and educational , and this is in contrast to the hidden , guarded and remote factories where leather and meat is produced today .
we need to move past just killing animals as a resource to something more civilized and evolved .
thank you .
twelve years ago , i was a fresh graduate seeking my way in the world .
i love finding , wearing , and more recently , photographing and blogging a different , colorful , crazy outfit for every single occasion .
but i do n't buy anything new .
aww , thank you .
i get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt .
will i like the color ?
so i 'm going to show you exactly what i brought .
i was betting that i 'd be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to palm springs .
and since you do n't know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear — ( laughter ) that means i found a few things .
and i 'd really love to show you my week 's worth of outfits right now .
( applause ) so as i do this , i 'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new .
so let 's start with sunday .
( laughter ) if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
and if you do n't think you look good in something , you 're also probably right .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out .
but it was n't until i turned 30 that i really got what this meant .
and i 'm going to break it down for you for just a second .
so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .
thank you .
( applause ) friday : a universal truth — five words for you : gold sequins go with everything .
and finally , saturday : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
when i was a kid , i experienced something so powerful , i spent the rest of my life searching for it , and in all the wrong places .
fellas ?
music makes everything have more emotional resonance .
when i hear that one song from that one summer with that one girl , i 'm instantly transported back there again .
i thought if i added more layers on top of the music , i could make the feelings even more powerful .
so i got into directing music videos .
this is what they looked like .
so i started thinking : if i could involve you , the audience , more , i might be able to make you feel something more as well .
and after years of searching , i found a prototype .
i could taste the lightning .
it was called virtual reality .
this was it five years ago when i ran into it .
`` all of these mediums require what we call `` '' suspension of disbelief , '' '' because there 's a translation gap between the reality of the story and our consciousness interpreting the story into our reality . ''
or you are the clan leader .
so the potential for vr is enormous .
we are the equivalent of year one of cinema .
so , first : camera movement is tricky in vr .
the music guides you there .
it brings that character inside of your personal space , a space that we 'd usually reserve for the people that we love .
but where do we go from here ?
the format has never changed .
we 're using your senses as the paints on the canvas , but only two right now .
but here i am , intellectualizing a medium i 'm saying is experiential .
we played in cardboard boxes as kids , and as adults , i 'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning by sticking our head in one again .
( video ) woman 's voice : dear lord , protect us from evil , for you are the lord , the light .
help us to live again .
( applause ) i believe that everyone on earth needs to experience what you just experienced .
and according to the surveys , we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world .
and because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon , nobody went to the polling stations .
on one level nobody 's questioning that democracy is the best form of government .
because especially now with the economic crisis , you can see that the trust in politics , that the trust in democratic institutions , was really destroyed .
and the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s , which put the individual at the center of politics .
it was the human rights moment .
so i do believe that even things like that are very much the children of '68 — nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then .
and it was the birth of the global world .
it has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics .
so this is what went right .
all this was very much under attack .
and it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand .
and you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies .
and i find this very much disturbing when we 're talking about what 's going on right and wrong with democracy these days .
this is also partly a result of the internet revolution .
we are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust .
but also do n't forget , any unveiling is also veiling .
[ regardless of ] how transparent our governments want to be , they 're going to be selectively transparent .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision — it is a real case story — that all of the governmental decisions , discussions of the council of ministers , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the council discussions took place .
and the public was extremely all for it .
right when i was 15 was when i first got interested in solar energy .
every newborn was as singular as a snowflake , a matchless mash-up of biology and ancestry and mystery .
`` albert einstein called this state , this dimension , `` only being . '' ''
one : uncover your soul .
and three : every now and then , step off your hamster wheel into deep time .
the same happened for me .
after that best year of my sister 's life , the cancer came roaring back , and this time there was nothing more the doctors could do .
we can all do this .
we can do this with the disconnection and the discord all around us .
thank you .
now , the key here is to figure out what that schwarzschild radius is .
likewise , for the young stars , or in contrast , the young stars , they just should not be there .
i wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation , sharing some of the problems .
but before i dive into those i want to admit that i am an optimist .
another statistic , perhaps my favorite , is to look at childhood deaths .
it 's a phenomenal thing .
the next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again .
it 's been a severe disease for thousands of years .
deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s .
so it was absolutely gigantic .
a terrible disease . it was in the united states . it was in europe .
the other was treating the patients with quinine , or quinine derivatives .
and so that 's why the death rate did come down .
and more recently you can see it 's just around the equator .
and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries , it does n't get much investment .
for example , there 's more money put into baldness drugs than are put into malaria .
( laughter ) and rich men are afflicted .
it means that you ca n't get the economies in these areas going because it just holds things back so much .
and that 's happened now in a number of countries .
but we have to be careful because malaria — the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves .
if you go into a country with the right tools and the right way , you do it vigorously , you can actually get a local eradication .
there 's new drug discovery going on .
because the road map to get rid of this disease involves many things .
of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise .
and so as these elements come together , i 'm quite optimistic that we will be able to eradicate malaria .
and this is : how do you make a teacher great ?
let 's start with why this is important .
i can say that , even though i 'm a college drop-out .
so the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education .
not only has that been weak . it 's getting weaker .
but most of the dropouts had taken place before that .
and even if you graduate from high school , if you 're low-income , you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree .
if you 're low-income in the united states , you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree .
so , how do you make education better ?
we 've worked on small schools , we 've funded scholarships , we 've done things in libraries .
a top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class — based on test scores — by over 10 percent in a single year .
we should retain those people .
what are the characteristics of this top quartile ?
what do they look like ?
you might think these must be very senior teachers .
but it in no way is associated with being a better teacher .
but , overwhelmingly , it 's your past performance .
now , there are a few places — very few — where great teachers are being made .
it 's an unbelievable thing .
they have 66 schools — mostly middle schools , some high schools — and what goes on is great teaching .
in the teacher 's contract , it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom — sometimes to once per year .
they do n't have the test scores , and there 's a whole thing of trying to block the data .
and that allows us to understand who 's doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
of course , digital video is cheap now .
here 's a little clip of something i think i did poorly .
`` now there 's a book actually , about kipp — the place that this is going on — that jay matthews , a news reporter , wrote — called , `` '' work hard , be nice . '' '' and i thought it was so fantastic . ''
it gave you a sense of what a good teacher does .
( applause ) now , we put a lot of money into education , and i really think that education is the most important thing to get right for the country to have as strong a future as it should have .
in fact we have in the stimulus bill — it 's interesting — the house version actually had money in it for these data systems , and it was taken out in the senate because there are people who are threatened by these things .
so it 's going to take brilliant people like you to study these things , get other people involved — and you 're helping to come up with solutions .
( applause )
it should n't take away from other things .
miko : hey rockett ! c'mere !
there were some motifs and elements that would come up again later in her life .
i wanted to see what 's called archer 's paradox , the idea that in order to actually hit your target , you have to aim at something slightly skew from it .
i stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van , and they exited with this kind of relaxed focus .
one held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching .
and this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight on each shot .
mastery is not a commitment to a goal but to a constant pursuit .
how many times have we designated something a classic , a masterpiece even , while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished , riddled with difficulties and flaws , in other words , a near win ?
the pursuit of mastery , in other words , is an ever-onward almost .
we thrive when we stay at our own leading edge .
`` and he said , `` '' you learn how little you know . '' '' success motivates us , but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest . ''
one of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition .
in 1988 , she won the gold in the heptathlon and set a record of 7,291 points , a score that no athlete has come very close to since .
in navajo culture , some craftsmen and women would deliberately put an imperfection in textiles and ceramics .
we build out of the unfinished idea , even if that idea is our former self .
this is the dynamic of mastery .
completion is a goal , but we hope it is never the end .
thank you .
and geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .
i never did , though .
because she had saved me .
that is real suffering , and that is a real story .
trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in new jersey .
the scheme in that case was incredible .
they made their traffickers nearly four million dollars .
i 've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed .
let me tell you what that looks like .
it is merely what we find legally tolerable .
i totally agree .
we often dwell on human trafficking survivors ' victimization .
they were the emissaries of hope .
but i think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we 're all in , when it comes to human trafficking .
but that means we are all also part of its solution .
my responsibilities were largely related to tuberculosis , and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera .
my primary responsibility was uganda , but also i worked in rwanda and burundi and zaire , now congo , tanzania , malawi , and several other countries .
i was not aware of any epidemic problems in america .
how many of you have such a situation ?
and i noticed that they would move this little thermoregulatory device to change the temperature in their home by one degree or two degrees .
and i really did n't know what i would do , but friends of mine began telling me about children shooting other children with guns .
and this i had heard about before .
we who had worked in behavior knew that punishment was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued .
`` i 'd called this the `` '' everything '' '' theory , or eoe : everything on earth . ''
there was clustering .
and then we asked the question , well what really predicts a case of violence ?
in order to interrupt transmission , you need to detect and find first cases .
in other words , for t.b . you have to find somebody who has active t.b . who is infecting other people .
and there 's special workers for doing that .
and then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the united states at the time .
so violence interruptors hired from the same group , credibility , trust , access , just like the health workers in somalia , but designed for a different category , and trained in persuasion , cooling people down , buying time , reframing .
and then another category of worker , the outreach workers , to keep people in a way on therapy for six to 24 months .
just like t.b. , but the object is behavior change .
( applause ) and this was a beautiful thing for the neighborhood itself , first 50 or 60 days , then 90 days , and then there was unfortunately another shooting in another 90 days , and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon .
they were using parks they were n't using before .
there have been independent evaluations supported by the justice department and by the cdc and performed by johns hopkins that have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent reductions in shootings and killings using this new method .
now we 've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this , including being featured on the new york times ' sunday magazine cover story .
[ the interrupters ] however , not so fast , because a lot of people did not agree with this way of going about it .
in other words , what do you mean , health problem ?
what do you mean , no bad guys ?
yet we were able to manage malaria and reduce hiv and reduce diarrheal diseases in places with awful economies without healing the economy .
and the u.s. conference of mayors has endorsed not only the approach but the specific model .
so violence is responding as a disease even as it behaves as a disease .
and moving away from emotions is the most important part of the solution to science as a more important part of the solution .
for myself , i tried to get away from infectious diseases , and i did n't .
but they just do n't seem to get through .
lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers .
let 's see chris 's program throughout the rest of the show . okay ?
`` so here is the `` '' thinking different '' '' bit . ''
thank you .
but this story 's not about eliminating it , it 's about minimizing it .
this is a chicken with teeth .
we can make a chicken with teeth .
and on the other side there was a rising sun .
this can be in politics .
but we were expected to have doubts ; we 're expected to have fears .
64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot , the batteries , flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency .
this is the complete structure of the airplane .
a little bit like on this picture here .
because the most renewable energy we have is our own potential , and our own passion .
so when we talk about elections , we in established democracies , we know what we 're talking about .
and for the provincial council , we had even more candidates .
people had no idea about what a box looked like .
it was very complicated , so using verbal communication was obviously the way to go , but there were 132 languages .
there was libya , there was egypt , there was yemen .
it was an enormous , enormous historical moment .
`` so that 's not quite right either , because there is a term that 's already accepted and in use , which was the word `` '' muraqib '' '' which means `` '' a controller . '' '' it 's got that notion of control . ''
and that 's what we did .
it meant actually defining 481 terms which formed the basis of everything you need to know if you 're going to organize a democratic election .
so in one sense you had the problem that language was n't fully ripe , if you like , neologisms were coming up , new expressions .
`` `` '' yes , we understand the definition . ''
and this newly formed arab organization for electoral management bodies , which is trying to professionalize how elections are run in the region , they 're using it as well .
we hear the chaos of war . we hear terrorism .
what are they aspiring to ?
the silent majority needs to know .
it is time to provide people with the knowledge tools that they can inform themselves with .
you just had to do things sometimes .
she has an issue with authority .
i had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before .
and as the very first pilot middle school in all of los angeles unified school district , you better believe there was some opposition .
but what if we get it right ?
so even though teachers were against it because we employ one-year contracts — you ca n't teach , or you do n't want to teach , you do n't get to be at my school with my kids .
these were played in the local trolley system .
`` and it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say , `` '' know , the district is trying to impose this , but you have the freedom to do otherwise . '' '' and it takes an active parent center who is not only there , showing a presence every day , but who is part of our governance , making decisions for their kids , our kids . ''
you go into these booths , you interview your grandmother or relative , you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the library of congress .
it 's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive one conversation at a time .
( kissing ) mw : so kids , this is how your mother and i got married , in a booth in grand central station with my father 's ring .
my grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years .
the entire project is predicated on this act of love which is listening itself .
and that motion of building an institution out of a moment of conversation and listening is actually a lot of what my firm , local projects , is doing with our engagements in general .
`` glenn lowry , the head of moma , put it best when he said , `` '' we want visitors to actually cease being visitors . ''
or this individual piece here , you can see the actual bedroom . it really changes the way you think about this type of a tempera painting .
and so you can imagine that , as people are performing inside of the museum itself , you get this sense of this emotional connection , this way in which our face connects with the thousands and tens of thousands of years .
so we started in 2006 as part of a team with thinc design to create the original master plan for the museum , and then we 've done all the media design both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production .
and you can see from these images , the site is so raw and almost archaeological .
it 's in six languages , and you can tell your own story about what happened to you on that day .
this is a shot from the brooklyn-battery tunnel .
`` it was a shock emotionally , yet a blessing to find this photo , '' '' and he was writing because he said , `` '' i 'd like to personally thank the photographer for posting the photo , as it meant more than words can describe to me to have access to what is probably the last photo ever taken of my son . '' '' and it really made us recognize what this institution needed to be in order to actually tell that story . ''
and so we started imagining the museum , along with the creative team at the museum and the curators , thinking about how the first voice that you would hear inside the museum would actually be of other visitors .
voice 5 : i was in times square . voice 6 : são paolo , brazil .
( multiple voices ) voice 13 : i got a call from my father . voice 14 : the phone rang , it woke me up .
my business partner told me to turn on the television .
`` `` how could 9/11 have happened ? '' ''
and suddenly the institution , once again , turns into a listening experience .
so i 'll play you just a short excerpt of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices , but you really get a sense of the poetry of everyone 's reflection on the event .
voice 4 : all the outpouring of affection and emotion that came from our country was something really that will forever , ever stay with me .
voice 5 : still today i pray and think about those who lost their lives , and those who gave their lives to help others , but i 'm also reminded of the fabric of this country , the love , the compassion , the strength , and i watched a nation come together in the middle of a terrible tragedy .
jb : and so as people make their way out of the museum , reflecting on the experience , reflecting on their own thoughts of it , they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself , because they 've gone back up to grade , and we actually got involved in the memorial after we 'd done the museum for a few years .
so this is an image of the actual algorithm itself with the names scrambled for privacy , but you can see that these blocks of color are actually the four different flights , the two different towers , the first responders , and you can actually see within that different floors , and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections that were requested by the families themselves .
and so when you go to the memorial , you can actually see the overarching organization inside of the individual pools themselves .
you can see the way that the geography of the event is reflected inside of the memorial , and you can search for an individual name , or in this case an employer , cantor fitzgerald , and see the way in which all of those names , those hundreds of names , are actually organized onto the memorial itself , and use that to navigate the memorial .
you can see the relationships between the different names themselves .
in this case , harry ramos , who was the head trader at an investment bank , who stopped to aid victor wald on the 55th floor of the south tower .
today , of course , there 's an unprecedented amount of stories for all of us that are being captured for future generations .
( applause )
allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone .
you know that all over the world , people fight for their freedom , fight for their rights .
earlier that day , i noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school .
he would n't tell me what happened .
but those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth , when it all came together .
i was faced with an organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared in family gatherings , in the streets and in schools .
as long as i 've known , women in saudi arabia have been always complaining about the ban , but it 's been 20 years since anyone tried to do anything about it , a whole generation ago .
that realization ignited the idea of june 17 , where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive .
`` it was a few weeks later , we started receiving all these `` man wolves will rape you if you go and drive . '' ''
we needed proof .
we wanted to know how the authorities would respond on the actual day , june 17 , when women go out and drive .
so this time i asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car .
outside the jail , the whole country went into a frenzy , some attacking me badly , and others supportive and even collecting signatures in a petition to be sent to the king to release me .
i was released after nine days .
the streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars , but some hundred brave saudi women broke the ban and drove that day .
( laughter ) i know , i was like this , i was shocked .
and it becomes worse when it 's enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law , or the religious laws .
just to tell you , two stories happened in the last two years .
`` `` '' manal al-sharif breaks down and confesses : 'foreign forces incited me . ' '' '' ( laughter ) and it goes on , even trial and flogging me in public . ''
so it 's these two totally different perceptions of my personality .
thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you . ( applause )
thank you .
i learned to be always there .
i would use actions . when they said i should withdraw from the campaign , i filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver 's license .
`` but all i know , and all i 'm sure of , in the future when someone asks me my story , i will say , `` '' i 'm proud to be amongst those women who lifted the ban , fought the ban , and celebrated everyone 's freedom . '' '' so the question i started my talk with , who do you think is more difficult to face , oppressive governments or oppressive societies ? ''
`` we put the diaeresis , the double dot , over the `` '' i '' '' in `` '' naïve . '' '' we impose house style . ''
the new yorker 's is particularly distinctive .
`` but you see that hyphen in `` '' teen-age '' '' and that diaeresis over `` '' coöperate , '' '' and you know you 're reading the new yorker . ''
our purpose is to make the author look good .
note that we give our proofs not directly to the author , but to the editor .
here is the most recent mistake that was laid at my door .
there 's no excuse for this mistake .
`` `` are there really two commas in 'martin luther king , jr. , boulevard ' ? '' ''
copy editors , too , have a code ; we do n't advertise our oversights .
`` i 'd never seen it used as a verb with this spelling , and i was distraught to think that `` '' mic'ed '' '' would get into the magazine on my watch . ''
nope .
i wonder , when the mail comes in , which will have offended the readers more .
( applause )
`` `` johnny , do n't do that . '' ''
you know , calculus is wonderful .
but they do n't save marriages and they do n't raise children .
how you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy ?
you know , how to prepare you for your first relationship ?
so , that would be my wish to the future .
( applause )
now , it did n't take me any time .
you have formulas that long .
so where did this come from ?
i mean , think about how different cities are , actually .
but then , on the other hand , you have the american cities .
i mean , it basically — i have n't really thought of it .
`` it basically organizes itself . '' '' it organizes itself . ''
this is a map of stockholm , my hometown .
and these red dots show the most congested parts , which are the bridges that lead into the inner city .
and then someone came up with the idea that , apart from good public transport , apart from spending money on roads , let 's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks .
now , congestion charges were introduced in stockholm on january 3 , 2006 , and the first picture here is a picture of stockholm , one of the typical streets , january 2 .
this is what happens when you take away 20 percent of the cars from the streets .
well , the thing is that , the congestion charges , they were introduced first as a trial , so they were introduced in january and then abolished again at the end of july , followed by a referendum , and then they were reintroduced again in 2007 , which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity .
i mean , this was a really fun experiment to start with , and we actually got to do it twice .
the first day they all came back .
now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know , but i would say that the most surprising slide here i 'm going to show you today is not this one . it 's this one .
well , think about it this way . who changed ?
well , so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services , and tried to figure out who changed , and where did they go ?
and why is that ? it 's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think .
each day , people make new decisions , and people change and the world changes around them , and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people do n't even notice .
this is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems , and when you do that , you should n't try to tell people how to adapt .
pm : thank you for those images , nadia .
thank you .
maybe you 've heard of us .
and also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture .
at first , the first thing i thought was , i want to run away .
second , they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside , and then you need a lot of cooling .
in a city where this should n't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year .
and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa and with ethiopia .
so i thought , this is what i really want to design , not a shopping mall .
so the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entrances of the building .
and this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open-air space in the building that self-protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain .
and i really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions .
and i started thinking about the textile like a shell made of concrete with perforations that would let the air in , and also the light , but in a filtered way .
and we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building .
`` with these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like , `` this is not a shopping mall . we did n't ask for that . '' ''
so we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project .
and the first implementation was to think about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day .
during that analysis i paid special attention to the medina that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall , opened by twelve different gates , connected by almost straight lines .
the volume has this connecting shape that shades itself with three different types of apartments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood and in the courtyards there are the different facilities , such as a gym and a kindergarten and close by , a series of commercial [ spaces ] that bring activity to the ground floor .
and it 's where all the neighbors , they can go up and socialize , and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning , jumping from one building to another .
we live in a very complex environment : complexity and dynamism and patterns of evidence from satellite photographs , from videos .
we 're interested in more than that .
we know what happened over the 20th century .
but where , in our increasingly secular and fragmented world , do we offer communality of experience , unmediated by our own furious consumerism ?
and what narrative , what history , what identity , what moral code are we imparting to our young ?
cinema is arguably the 20th century 's most influential art form .
as a human being , it puts the fear of god in me .
the irony is palpable ; technical access has never been greater , cultural access never weaker .
it is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor .
`` in choosing `` '' hotel rwanda , '' '' they explored genocide of the most brutal kind . ''
`` and when `` '' schindler 's list '' '' demanded that they never forget , one child , full of the pain of consciousness , remarked , `` '' we already forgot , otherwise how did 'hotel rwanda ' happen ? '' '' as they watch more films their lives got palpably richer . ''
they celebrated a change in attitude towards non-white britons , but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity , unlike that offered by sidney poitier 's careful tutelage .
from 25 clubs , we became hundreds , then thousands , until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in 7,000 clubs right across the country .
what would they do under the same conditions ?
how has the world changed ? how could it be different ?
in a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on table mountain and playing cops and robbers .
quite recently she told me that in 1948 , two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to israel without my grandparents .
i was past 40 when my father died .
my mother 's mother left europe in a hurry without her husband , but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt .
after two years in hiding , my grandfather appeared in london .
`` i had `` '' anne frank , '' '' `` '' the great escape , '' '' `` shoah , '' `` triumph of the will . '' ''
each a piece of memorable art , each a brick in the wall of who we are .
they are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed .
we appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes , yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered .
thank you .
and it 's hard for a couple of reasons .
first , everything 's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you 'd pay on the street , and second , you do n't make a lot of money .
and there 's very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there 's a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
you want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head ? three hundred bucks .
look , i lied to the feds . i lost a year of my life from it .
thank you . ( applause )
this review did not sit well with the authors of bilal bot .
and that approach needs to be centered on the idea that we need to change the economics for the bad guys .
what is the top priority ?
we make cybercrime not pay .
we all have the opportunity to stop it , and we already all know how .
well , all but three were dead .
i 've started and run businesses because invention is a joy , and because working alongside brilliant , creative people is its own reward .
instead , they had three characteristics , the really successful teams .
and thirdly , the more successful groups had more women in them .
people do n't get stuck . they do n't waste energy down dead ends .
the problem was solved in less than a day .
it means that time is everything , because social capital compounds with time .
and time is what builds value .
we 're used to talking about stars .
now , we need to let people motivate each other .
but one team that rose to the challenge adopted three key principles .
( cheering ) not good enough .
yeah .
`` so i start shouting from the rooftops , `` '' i 'm finally going to get a part ! ''
i have cerebral palsy !
they only hired perfect people .
i got to act in a movie with adam sandler and work with my idol , the amazing dave matthews .
i was a delegate representing the great state of new jersey at the 2008 dnc .
and of course , all of you know what that word is .
and that allows us to accelerate how this stuff happens .
and we kind of take it for granted how we 've changed sex .
what 's happened with sex over time is — normally , sex equals baby , eventually .
and it 's not the case for animals .
and when you do in vitro fertilization , there 's very good reasons to do it .
she 's studying accounting .
and so what lived and died , what was structured , has now been flipped on its head .
so let me explain these things .
so this lifecode stuff .
these are n't random mutations .
and some in washington have a lot more of it .
we want to have darwin 's evolutionary system running .
this is the single most exciting adventure human beings have been on .
wrong .
one of the major problems with patent law is that , in the case that when you are sued by a patent troll , the burden of proof that you did not infringe on the patent is actually on the defendant , which means you have to prove that you do not infringe on the patent they 're suing you on .
and this can take quite a while .
you need to know that the average patent troll defense costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
that is your best case outcome when you get sued by a patent troll .
and they started settling out .
now perhaps it 's because no such screenshots actually existed , but suddenly gooseberry wanted to settle .
never mind the fact that the address led to a strip mall somewhere in northern l.a .
no counter offer .
now the reason this works is because patent trolls are paid a percentage of what they 're able to recover in settlements .
now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way .
well to sum up , it boils down to one thing : do n't negotiate with terrorists .
the health care industry would like stronger protections for inventors .
and these goals are n't necessarily diametrically opposed , but they are at odds .
thank you .
( applause )
i will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging and how we may treat age-related diseases in the future .
it started with experiments that showed , in a recent number of studies about growing , that animals — old mice — that share a blood supply with young mice can get rejuvenated .
we can do cognitive tests , we can do imaging — all kinds of sophisticated testing .
so , how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism .
could we potentially understand more about what happens in the brain at the molecular level if we see the brain as part of the entire body ?
so if the body ages or gets sick , does that affect the brain ?
so if we look at how the blood changes in disease or age , can we learn something about the brain ?
so , how many years they lived .
but more importantly : is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age-related disease and will have a long life — will live to 100 or more ?
so what i 'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue .
and there 's less of this bad inflammation .
as mice get older , like us humans , they have memory problems .
in stark contrast , this mouse here is a sibling of the same age , but it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks , with small injections every three days .
`` and as you noticed , it almost looks around , `` '' where am i ? '' '' — and then walks straight to that hole and escapes . ''
they 're not set in stone ; we can actually change them .
it can be rejuvenated .
but for me , the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise .
in the eye of a theoretical physicist , the higgs boson is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass , but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution .
for this reason , the majority of theoretical physicists believe that the higgs boson could not be the full story .
of course , the verdict is not definitive .
in 2015 , the lhc will almost double the energy of the colliding protons , and these more powerful collisions will allow us to explore further the particle world , and we will certainly learn much more .
but for the moment , since we have found no evidence for new phenomena , let us suppose that the particles that we know today , including the higgs boson , are the only elementary particles in nature , even at energies much larger than what we have explored so far .
for instance , the tunnel diode , a component used in electronics , works thanks to the wonders of quantum tunneling .
if the ultra-dense higgs state existed , then , because of quantum tunneling , a bubble of this state could suddenly appear in a certain place of the universe at a certain time , and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water .
the bubble would then expand at the speed of light , invading all space , and turning the higgs field from the familiar state into a new state .
we may not realize it in ordinary life , but the intensity of the higgs field is critical for the structure of matter .
in other words , i ask myself , what is the fate of the higgs field in our universe ?
and the crucial ingredient necessary to answer this question is the higgs boson mass .
it has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation .
in about five billion years , our sun will become a red giant , as large as the earth 's orbit , and our earth will be kaput , and in a thousand billion years , if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate , you will not even be able to see as far as your toes , because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light .
and indeed , a possible answer to my question opens up new universes , literally .
then the key to the mystery could lie in the statistical properties of the multiverse .
it would be something like what happens with sand dunes on a beach .
just one number , the higgs boson mass , and yet , out of this number we learn so much .
i started from a hypothesis , that the known particles are all there is in the universe , even beyond the domain explored so far .
that 's how physics works : a single measurement can put us on the road to a new understanding of the universe or it can send us down a blind alley .
thank you .
this is almost poetic .
these were really profound experiences .
`` and he says to me , `` do n't stand there . you might disappear . '' ''
so this is absurd , right ?
for a minute , i felt like my existence as a person had been noticed , and i was worth saving .
`` so instead of using our perceptions and making choices , we rely on this category of `` '' stranger . '' '' i have a four-year-old . ''
so , our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity , but preparing them to meet it well .
adversity is just change that we have n't adapted ourselves to yet .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility — or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous — we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
well , first we looked at words .
over 40 percent .
you have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful .
what that means is , you 've got to wait 37 years ...
of course , it varies by profession .
so what if we analyze these two groups separately — the famous and the non-famous ?
what might that tell us ?
( applause )
what 's the commercial picture here ?
the content is not dinner table conversation in the least .
the 404 page is that .
and it serves you the 404 page .
you sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey .
they took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place .
because finally there was a page that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404 .
stayhound , which helps you find pet sitters through your social network , commiserated with your pet .
at 4:04 the next day , we gave out $ 404 in cash .
you can type in an url and put in a 404 and these will pop .
this is one that commiserates with you .
because back to the whole relationship issue , what they figured out through this exercise was that a simple mistake can tell me what you 're not , or it can remind me of why i should love you .
thank you .
ironically , hardly anyone noticed at the time .
on that morning , u.s. president bill clinton ordered that a special switch be thrown in the orbiting satellites of the global positioning system .
but we now stand on the verge of another revolution in geolocation accuracy .
so why do n't we have this capability on our phones ?
only , i believe , for a lack of imagination .
manufacturers have n't built this carrier phase technique into their cheap gps chips because they 're not sure what the general public would do with geolocation so accurate that you could pinpoint the wrinkles in the palm of your hand .
for one thing , gps does n't work indoors , and for another , they do n't make devices quite this small , especially when those devices have to relay their measurements back over a network .
so you might ask at this point why she 's calling you .
well , so did i .
`` `` '' well , you should go to a good mechanic and have him look at your car , '' '' i said . ''
`` `` '' i already have , '' '' she told me . ''
`` `` '' he did n't see anything obvious , and he said he 'd have to take the car apart piece by piece . '' '' `` `` well then , you 'd better go to the police , '' '' i said . ''
carol is n't the first , and certainly wo n't be the last , to find herself in this kind of fearsome environment , worrisome situation caused by gps tracking .
`` it 's an open-source gps jammer , developed by limor fried , a graduate student at mit , and limor calls it `` a tool for reclaiming our personal space . '' ''
then she posted her design to the web , and if you do n't have time to build your own , you can buy one .
i should have one . might come in handy if somebody ever puts a tracking device on my car .
and why is that ?
they go on to jam innocent gps receivers for miles around you . ( laughter ) now , if you 're carol or limor , or someone who feels threatened by gps tracking , it might not feel wrong to turn on a wave bubble , but in fact , the results can be disastrous .
imagine , for example , you 're the captain of a cruise ship trying to make your way through a thick fog and some passenger in the back turns on a wave bubble .
they — in fact , they do n't update or upkeep lighthouses anymore , and loran , the only backup to gps , was discontinued last year .
so let me show you how this works .
they have no encryption . they have no authentication .
we knew it was n't going to be so hard , and we wanted to be the first to build one so we could get out in front of the problem and help protect against gps spoofing .
at first , the spoofer was just a jumble of cables and computers , though we eventually got it packaged into a small box .
they seemed to speak to me .
i saw airplanes and ships veering off course , with the captain learning only too late that something was wrong .
it 's the ultimate weapon against an invasion of gps dots .
imagine , for example , you 're being tracked .
or , if you 're carol , you could lure your ex-boyfriend into some empty parking lot where the police are waiting for him .
you 'll never lose track of your things again .
or will you be able to resist the temptation to turn on a gps spoofer or a wave bubble to protect your own privacy ?
`` what i 'm most interested in as a scientist is the `` '' how '' '' of science . ''
the prediction : everything should circle around the earth .
this led us to learn something new .
this is how science moves forward . this is how science learns .
i think what he missed is brotherhood .
bg : well , my graph has numbers on it .
what about failure , though ?
so she kept wanting to talk to me and jenn .
writing books is my profession but it 's more than that , of course .
why not think about it this way ?
do n't be daunted . just do your job .
i 'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway .
the right hand is the one we write with , apart from the left-handers .
so , in the tidied-up version we have a sort of keith haring spare parts shop .
tidying up rene magritte — this is really fun .
so after a while i decided to have a little fun , and before leaving the room each day i 'd scatter a few things around the space .
like books , clothes , toothbrush , etc . and it was great .
by the time i returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place .
and when i returned it looked like this .
it is absolutely gorgeous .
she giggles and squeals , and gives herself these big , wet kisses .
and like any teenager , she just wants to be liked and to fit in .
because of the difference between what her mom tells her and what her friends at school , or her peers at school are telling her , she does n't know who to believe .
well , so far , faye has received over 13,000 comments .
they 're under pressure to be online and available at all times , talking , messaging , liking , commenting , sharing , posting — it never ends .
never before have we been so connected , so continuously , so instantaneously , so young .
and as one mom told me , it 's like there 's a party in their bedroom every night .
there 's no separation between online and offline life .
and it 's also really hard to tell the difference between what 's authentic and what 's digitally manipulated .
what 's a highlight in someone 's life versus what 's normal in the context of everyday .
and where are they looking to for inspiration ?
for those who do n't know , # proana means pro-anorexia .
well , surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy , well balanced individuals .
these are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contributors to society and to the workforce .
the bad news is that most of them do n't work .
think about what this might mean for someone in your life .
our robot belongs to a family of robots called ballbots .
you might ask yourself , what 's the usefulness of a robot that 's unstable ?
now we 'll explain that in a second .
this happens 160 times per second , and if anything fails in this process , rezero would immediately fall to the ground .
you may have wondered what happens if i give the robot a little push .
in this mode , he 's trying to maintain his position .
in the next mode , rezero is passive , and we can move him around .
in the next mode , we can get rezero to follow a person .
we call this the orbiting mode .
rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks .
and of course , who would n't like to take a ride on one of these .
and i focus on that , on the present moment .
and they looked at the herbivores . and they were n't savanna herbivores .
he knew all about that kind of science .
and he called it hypothesis-free science .
look at the fat layer .
it ended with a new synthesis : darwin 's ideas and mendel 's ideas blending together .
so if it 's going to come and it 's going to happen , what 's holding it up ?
the professional journals wo n't touch it with a barge pole .
( applause )
and the genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters a , t , c and g .
but nothing , of course , in nature is totally perfect , so sometimes an error is made and a wrong letter is built in .
if we compare my genome to the genome of you , approximately every 1,200 , 1,300 letters will differ between us .
approximately one letter in a hundred will differ from a chimpanzee .
and generally we depict our ideas about this history in the form of trees like this .
farther back is there one shared with chimpanzees .
and because these mutations happen approximately as a function of time , you can transform these differences to estimates of time , where the two humans , typically , will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago , and with the chimpanzees , it will be in the order of five million years ago .
another consequence of this recent origin of modern humans is that genetic variants are generally distributed widely in the world , in many places , and they tend to vary as gradients , from a bird's-eye perspective at least .
but does this then mean , as many people tend to think , that there are huge genetic differences between groups of people — on different continents , for example ?
well we can begin to ask those questions also .
this may be surprising .
so this is very surprising .
what happened to the neanderthals ?
and to begin to answer such questions , my research group — since over 25 years now — works on methods to extract dna from remains of neanderthals and extinct animals that are tens of thousands of years old .
does it match one african or the other african ?
the same is true if we look at a chinese individual versus an african , the neanderthal will match the chinese individual more often .
presumably , they did so first in the middle east , where there were neanderthals living .
so that today , the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals .
and the first place we 've done that is in southern siberia in the altai mountains at a place called denisova , a cave site in this mountain here , where archeologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone — this is a copy of it — that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human .
and further back , 800,000 years ago is there a common origin with present day humans .
so this individual comes from a population that shares an origin with neanderthals , but far back and then have a long independent history .
in the west , there were neanderthals ; in the east , there were denisovans — maybe other forms of humans too that we 've not yet described .
then modern humans emerged somewhere in africa , came out of africa , presumably in the middle east .
so to sum up , what have we learned from studying genomes of present day humans and extinct humans ?
we made it learn from us , and we set it free in the desert .
we 've driven 140,000 miles .
we 've driven from san francisco to los angeles on highway 1 .
what ?
do you realize that you , ted users , spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic , wasting your time on your daily commute ?
this is four billion hours wasted in this country alone .
for me , today , on this date , it 's like a second bar mitzvah experience .
okay , so everything around it is whole and intact .
so you can change the intensity , the frequency , the duration , the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush to a hammer .
and i am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing , physically focusing .
when i was born , this idea was already conceived by pioneers such as the fry brothers and lars leksell , who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife .
he failed , so he then invented the gammaknife .
they were missing the vision .
this is an mr suite with a focused ultrasound system .
and i will give you several examples .
so the first one is in the brain .
and medication did n't help him anymore .
and many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain .
and about four or five months ago , he underwent an experimental procedure .
it is approved under an fdaide at the university of virginia in charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus .
`` `` '' on june 20th , '' '' if you can read it , `` 2011 . '' ''
we attach a transducer , in this case , to the brain , but if it will be a different organ , it will be a different transducer attached to the patient .
and the objective of that ?
you see the transducer , the light blue .
it elevates the temperature .
it does n't do any damage , but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees .
the temperature was raised to 43 degrees c temporarily .
but the point is we are right on target .
this is the outcome from a patient perspective — same day after the treatment .
( applause ) thank you .
i mean , those people lose their independence .
he returned to a normal life routine .
okay , so you can see here the spot .
it 's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain .
he 's back to his normal life .
let 's move now to a more painful subject .
he 's a 78 year-old farmer who suffered from — how should i say it ? — it 's called pain in the butt .
he had metastases in his right buttock , and he could n't sit even with medication .
and you have to understand what those people feel and what their family experiences when it happens .
he rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly .
show us some primary cancer .
so i have good news and bad news .
and it has been shown actually outside of the u.s .
and doing that in the u.s .
i do n't see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen .
we heard here yesterday quyen talking about the adverse event trait in prostate cancer .
the challenge there with a breathing and awake patient — and in all our treatments , the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician — is you have to teach the mr some tricks how to do it in real time .
and this is , in 2004 , the fda has approved mr-guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids .
women suffer from that disease .
this is frances .
she was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid .
she was offered a hysterectomy , but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option .
so new life was born .
he can stop the surgery at any moment .
did you know this was happening ?
so do n't fear , this is not going to be a cooking demonstration .
who prefers the whole-meal bread ?
okay , now the question is really , why is this so ?
well i think it has a lot to do with our history .
it was a mythical past .
but we have , somehow , in the course of the last few centuries , or even decades , started to cultivate an image of a mythical , rural agricultural past .
it brought us power . it brought us mechanization , fertilizers .
all that is a real , great improvement , as we shall see .
now you may prefer this loaf of bread .
excuse my hands but this is how it is .
but actually the real relevant bread , historically , is this white wonder loaf .
but it has changed the world .
this tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways and has a lot of problems has changed the world .
with the advent of the industrial revolution with modernization of agriculture in the last few decades , since the 1960s , food availability , per head , in this world , has increased by 25 percent .
that means that we have now more food available than ever before in human history .
what happened to our bread in the meantime ?
and it frees us all up to do other things — to sit at ted meetings and not to worry about our food .
so as food became more plentiful , bread became cheaper .
and as it became cheaper , bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things .
we add in raisins and oil and milk and all kinds of things to make bread , from a simple food into kind of a support for calories .
and today , bread now is associated with obesity , which is very strange .
and the whiter the bread , in many countries , the better it is .
it was invented by farmers in iraq and syria in particular .
the tiny spike on the left to the center is actually the forefather of wheat .
this is where it all comes from , and where these farmers who actually , ten thousand years ago , put us on the road of bread .
let 's go back to traditional farming .
`` let 's go back to small-scale , to farmers ' markets , small bakeries and all that . '' '' wonderful . ''
if we do this , if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming we are going , actually , to relegate these poor farmers and their husbands — among whom i have lived for many years , working without electricity and water , to try to improve their food production — we relegate them to poverty .
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this .
so local food production is out .
so what can we do ?
we need clever low-key mechanization that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we 've had .
so what can we do ?
what you see is that we 've started in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture , which was sort of small-scale and low-control .
we have much cleverer irrigation .
and we need to think very dispassionately about the comparative advantages of small-scale and large-scale .
we can not solve the world food problem by using biological agriculture .
there is all kinds of things we can do .
talk to people in restaurants .
we need to help to lift them out of poverty .
we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive .
let me share with those of you here in the first row .
i want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future : to these anonymous farmers , that first bred the first wheat varieties ; and to the farmers of today , who 've been making this . and you do n't even know who they are .
every meal you eat contains ingredients from all across the world .
everything makes us so privileged , that we can eat this food , that we do n't struggle every day .
eat it , and feel privileged .
thank you very much .
i think of our architecture as organizational structures .
it has a population of over 10,000 people , and of course , this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension of many things and the scale of typical architecture .
the building has become part of everyday life in beijing .
and i think that could be one of its primary meanings that we believe in .
the idea was to bring together some of britain 's greatest institutions , some international ones , and to create a new system of synergies .
and he built exhibition road , a linear sequence of those institutions .
our own mind can be our best friend or our worst enemy .
we can still prosper , humanity can still prosper for 150,000 years if we keep the same stability of climate as in the holocene for the last 10,000 years .
at the third pole , 2,000 glaciers are melting fast , faster than the arctic .
so the question is , okay , altruism is the answer , it 's not just a novel ideal , but can it be a real , pragmatic solution ?
but this guy does n't seem too bad .
fortunately , there is the evolution of culture .
we have 25,000 kids in school , four percent overhead .
we need sustainable harmony . i love this term .
so this is where we started our search .
shadi and his sisters got out .
management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff . ( laughter ) a recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe their employees are inspired by their firm .
i 'm a marketer , and as a marketer , i know that i 've never really been in control .
in fact , they have more control over the loss of control than ever before .
they can design for it . but how ?
companies can even give control to hackers .
the ultimate empowerment of customers is to ask them not to buy .
hulu and netflix , among other companies , have open vacation policies .
giving people less control might be a wonderful way to counter the abundance of choice and make them happier .
take the travel service nextpedition .
at frog , the company i work for , we hold internal speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees , helping them get to know each other fast .
but it 's taken a long time to get there .
chris anderson : so , jon , this feels scary .
jonathan haidt : yeah .
what on earth is going on , and how did we get here ?
and some people believed that process could continue indefinitely .
ca : and we were indeed expanding the sense of tribe for a while .
`` ca : and so , those of us who grew up with the beatles and that sort of hippie philosophy of dreaming of a more connected world — it felt so idealistic and `` '' how could anyone think badly about that ? '' '' and what you 're saying is that , actually , millions of people today feel that that is n't just silly ; it 's actually dangerous and wrong , and they 're scared of it . ''
and i think this is where we have to look very carefully at the social science about diversity and immigration .
`` and that leads to a progressive welfare state , a set of progressive left-leaning values , which says , `` '' drawbridge down ! the world is a great place . ''
so this is all very uncomfortable to talk about .
the left , following through the lennonist line — the john lennon line — does things that create an authoritarian reaction .
so an assimilationist approach to immigration removes a lot of these problems .
i 'll just list a couple of them .
so in america , one of the big — actually , america and europe — one of the biggest ones is world war ii .
and their youth was spent fighting each other within each country , in 1968 and afterwards .
so that 's one .
another , in america , is the purification of the two parties .
there used to be liberal republicans and conservative democrats .
i just did a quick search on twitter about the election and saw two tweets next to each other .
`` one , against a picture of racist graffiti : `` '' this is disgusting ! ''
if you look at the faces — if one of the couple shows disgust or contempt , that 's a predictor that they 're going to get divorced soon , whereas if they show anger , that does n't predict anything , because if you deal with anger well , it actually is good .
and then we want nothing to do with them .
the tragedy is , americans used to be much more mixed up in the their towns by left-right or politics .
so they 're over there , they 're far away .
and we apply it to the poor , the needy , the suffering .
ca : what would it look like to build that type of empathy ?
so it 's important to empathize with the groups that we on the left think are so important .
but empathy really should get you points if you do it when it 's hard to do .
jh : yeah , it 's very hard to just decide to overcome your deepest prejudices .
so i think you have to make an effort — that 's the main thing .
everybody has a cousin , a brother-in-law , somebody who 's on the other side .
thank you so much for sharing this time with us .
but these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard .
`` but in india there is no `` '' the '' '' promised land . ''
and you can never replicate that performance twice .
it is bound to happen .
i love mythology too much .
step a. step b. step c. mostly .
and when you understand it you will discover something spectacular .
so the machine i 'm going to talk you about is what i call the greatest machine that never was .
that machine was built by this guy , charles babbage .
he held the post that newton held at cambridge , and that was recently held by stephen hawking .
i 'll spend a fortune on it . i 've got a better idea .
`` i 'm going to work on this one . ( laughter ) and i 'm going to do this one . '' '' he did this until sir robert peel , then prime minister , basically kicked him out of number 10 downing street , and kicking him out , in those days , that meant saying , `` '' i bid you good day , sir . '' '' ( laughter ) the thing he designed was this monstrosity here , the analytical engine . now , just to give you an idea of this , this is a view from above . ''
of course , it 's this big .
there 's this incredible complexity in the cpu , and this incredible regularity in the memory .
all this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does , but of course you need to program this thing , and of course , babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the '50s , '60s and '70s , which is punch cards . this thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here , and this is a program in the science museum , just not far from here , created by charles babbage , that is sitting there — you can go see it — waiting for the machine to be built .
and there 's not just one of these , there 's many of them .
he prepared programs anticipating this would happen .
babbage , of course , wanted to use proven technology , so steam and things .
`` you 're not just going to have that , so , first of all , you had sound . you had a bell , so if anything went wrong — ( laughter ) — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it , there was a bell it could ring . ( laughter ) and there 's actually an instruction on the punch card which says `` '' ring the bell . '' '' so you can imagine this `` '' ting ! '' '' you know , just stop for a moment , imagine all those noises , this thing , `` '' click , clack click click click , '' '' steam engine , `` '' ding , '' '' right ? ( laughter ) you also need a printer , obviously , and everyone needs a printer . ''
this is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his , called the difference engine no . 2 , which he never built , but which the science museum did build in the '80s and '90s .
along comes this woman , ada lovelace .
`` the duke of wellington is there , you know , get out the machine , obviously demonstrates it , and she gets it . she 's the only person in his lifetime , really , who said , `` '' i understand what this does , and i understand the future of this machine . '' '' and we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that babbage was intending to build because of her . ''
this is a program written in a particular style .
babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics .
now , a hundred years later , this guy comes along , alan turing , and in 1936 , and invents the computer all over again .
turing 's machine was entirely theoretical .
we could go back to babbage 's machine and just make it tiny . all those things are computers .
it did have a ram pack .
one of those is a set of plans that we call plan 28 , and that is also the name of a charity that i started with doron swade , who was the curator of computing at the science museum , and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine , and our plan is to build it .
the project has a number of parts to it .
the third part is a computer simulation of that machine , and the last part is to physically build it at the science museum .
babbage himself wrote , he said , as soon as the analytical engine exists , it will surely guide the future course of science .
so this is just three sets of cogs , and it 's going to add . this is the adding mechanism in action , so you imagine this gigantic machine .
( laughter ) but just as the internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us , it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world .
and increasingly , the price we 're being asked to pay for all of this connectedness is our privacy .
and with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen , we are like hansel and gretel leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods .
we are leaving our birthdays , our places of residence , our interests and preferences , our relationships , our financial histories , and on and on it goes .
now do n't get me wrong , i 'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing .
in fact , when i know the data that 's being shared and i 'm asked explicitly for my consent , i want some sites to understand my habits .
and when all of that data is held , they can do almost whatever they want with it .
except for some of the recent announcements here in the united states and in europe , it 's an area of consumer protection that 's almost entirely naked .
the visualization you see forming behind me is called collusion and it 's an experimental browser add-on that you can install in your firefox browser that helps you see where your web data is going and who 's tracking you .
the blue dots are the sites that i 've actually navigated directly to .
so let me fast-forward through the rest of my day .
i look at this picture and it freaks me out .
i can tell you , there is n't a person in this room that would sit idly by .
our voices matter and our actions matter even more .
it 's now time for us to watch the watchers .
thank you .
four hundred years of maturing democracy , colleagues in parliament who seem to me , as individuals , reasonably impressive , an increasingly educated , energetic , informed population , and yet a deep , deep sense of disappointment .
they would bring prosperity , security , overcome sectarian violence , ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists .
and when i have conversations with people , i remember having a conversation , for example , in iraq , with a community that asked me whether the riot we were seeing in front of us , this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building , was a sign of the new democracy .
i remember in iraq , for example , that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy .
we need to get away from saying democracy matters because of the other things it brings .
the point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate , effective , prosperous rule of law .
the point about democracy is intrinsic .
democracy is not simply a question of structures .
it is a state of mind . it is an activity .
we need to stop that , to stop pretending to be omniscient beings .
our societies have never been so educated , have never been so energized , have never been so healthy , have never known so much , cared so much , or wanted to do so much , and it is a genius of the local .
in britain , it could mean looking to the french , learning from the french , getting directly elected mayors in place in a french commune system .
this is a screenshot from the virtual game world , entropia universe .
we just want to go back and find out more .
because there 's two heads inside one person when you think about it .
scholars have long invoked this metaphor of two selves when it comes to questions of temptation .
there is first , the present self .
this is like odysseus when he 's hearing the song .
this is odysseus as an old man who wants nothing more than to retire in a sunny villa with his wife penelope outside of ithaca — the other one .
it 's physically possible to exercise more .
it has these strong , heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth .
it does n't even have a lawyer present .
so there 's this battle between the two selves that 's being fought , and we need commitment devices to level the playing field between the two .
now i 'm a big fan of commitment devices actually .
because it 's not that easy to get rid of five dollars .
but then i was like , that 's more bad than writing is good , and so that would n't work .
so the first is , when you 've got one of these devices going , such as this contract to write everyday or pay , it 's just a constant reminder that you have no self-control .
the more you exercise it , the stronger it gets .
the other problem with commitment devices is that you can always weasel your way out of them .
you 're putting yourself , you 're binding yourself , and you 're weaseling your way out of it , and then you 're beating yourself up afterwards .
in particular , i 'm interested in the relationship to the future financial self .
the present self does not want to save at all .
whereas the future self wants the present self to save .
at the same time , the retirement risk index , the chance of not being able to meet your needs in retirement , has been increasing .
and we 're at a situation now where for every three baby boomers , the mckinsey global institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they 're in retirement .
the first is called the distribution builder .
it shows people what the future might be like by showing them a hundred equally probable outcomes that might be obtained in the future .
it means that you have to save more today .
`` once you find an investment that you 're happy with , what people do is they click `` '' done '' '' and the markers begin to disappear , slowly , one by one . ''
at the end , there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement .
they 're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working .
this is a simulation that uses graphics , but other people find motivating what money can buy , not just numbers .
the last thing i 'll show you , the last behavioral time machine , is something that i created with hal hershfield , who was introduced to me by my coauthor on a previous project , bill sharpe .
and what it is is an exploration into virtual reality .
he 's given a control that allows him to adjust his savings rate .
you can see his current annual income — this is the percentage of his paycheck that he can take home today — is quite high , 91 percent , but his retirement income is quite low .
so for instance , here is somebody using the tool .
and just watch the facial expressions as they move the slider .
your decisions today are going to determine its well-being .
this is actually a picture of hal , my coauthor .
and i 'll close it there .
and this is a very mesh-y thing .
it also has a very low carbon footprint .
you have to cut down the biodiverse forest if you want to get the field to grow the corn to feed people with , and so there 's a constant push-pull there .
but in the oceans , we do n't have that war .
one billion people in the world today do not have access to all-season roads .
one seventh of the earth 's population are totally cut off for some part of the year .
what would you do today ?
we use three key technologies .
the first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
they are at known locations on the ground , so the paths between them are also known , which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network .
here we are flying in haiti last summer , where we 've done our first field trials .
costs are coming down very rapidly .
( applause ) and it 's counterintuitive , but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today , and we 're just at the beginning of this .
when we saw this , we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world .
and we said , what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around 140 square kilometers ?
that 's roughly one and a half times the size of manhattan .
it 's decentralized , it 's peer-to-peer , it 's bidirectional , highly adaptable , with very low infrastructure investment , very low ecological footprint .
it can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
`` so when we started this a couple of years ago now , we 've had a lot of people come up to us who said , `` '' this is a very interesting but crazy idea , and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon . '' '' and of course , we 're talking about drones , right , a technology that 's not only unpopular in the west but one that has become a very , very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries , especially those engaged in conflict . ''
so why are we doing this ?
imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter .
in the developed world and the emerging world , we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable .
so for those that still believe that this is science fiction , i firmly say to you that it is not .
( applause )
and i think some dispassionate , quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate .
now rather than just argue about this number , a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he 'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across ocean boulevard to the westin , and then to mars ...
so that 's a chunk of what we 're looking for .
( laughter ) the movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft , which is quite a lot when you consider that , back in '98 , the bureau of labor statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people .
and so the job losses that came with the internet and all that content theft , have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries .
and this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day .
and it was a big christmas hit .
thank you very much .
what was your thesis in this book ?
mr : well , we first tried to get her to the best doctors we could .
ca : but you did n't accept that as the limit of what you could do .
and made an absolute fortune .
she 's alive , healthy today at 30 .
we do this through our company , united therapeutics .
i 'm as certain of that as i was of the success that we 've had with direct television broadcasting , sirius xm .
it 's long-lasting minds .
the background to one is the other .
`` here 's the word `` '' mirror . '' '' no , it 's not the same upside-down . ''
there is only one solution . it 's not that hard .
this is what 's going on in the games industry right now .
`` then recently `` '' rock band '' '' has been a big hit . ''
i 'll play as fast as i can .
we are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this .
and we did n't have the evidence for that .
this is the hi-seas program .
busy , busy work .
i learned a lot about how individual crew members actually cope with a situation like this ; how you can keep a crew productive and happy , for example , giving them a good deal of autonomy is a good trick to do that ; and honestly , i learned a lot about leadership , because i was a crew commander .
and that 's another crucial part of the project .
it 's an evolving artwork , evolving architecture .
it 's a whole lot more like a sponge .
in 2000 , this was the largest moving object on the planet .
i work with biologists .
but my very favorite project of all was over 15 years ago , when i was a part of the team that made the very first accurate , three-dimensional map of a subterranean surface .
and when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater and all of our water resources on this planet , then we 'll be working on the problem that 's probably the most important issue of this century .
gave it more love and care than my own child .
`` `` '' you see that stone wall out there ? ''
i built that stone wall with my bare hands .
stories affirm who we are .
it can cross the barriers of time , past , present and future , and allow us to experience the similarities between ourselves and through others , real and imagined .
we all know what it 's like to not care .
as : what this scene is doing , and it did in the book , is it 's fundamentally making a promise .
`` sometimes it 's as simple as `` '' once upon a time ... `` '' these carter books always had edgar rice burroughs as a narrator in it . ''
it confirmed something i really had a hunch on , is that the audience actually wants to work for their meal .
we 're compelled to deduce and to deduct , because that 's what we do in real life .
it 's not just that they 're damn cute ; it 's because they ca n't completely express what they 're thinking and what their intentions are .
do n't give them four , give them two plus two .
i do n't mean to make it sound like this is an actual exact science , it 's not .
stories are inevitable , if they 're good , but they 're not predictable .
i took a seminar in this year with an acting teacher named judith weston .
and i learned a key insight to character .
and some of us are born with temperaments that are positive , some are negative .
so i wanted to become much better at it and learn anything i could .
in the short-term , have you made me want to know what will happen next ?
`` an example would be in `` '' finding nemo , '' '' in the short tension , you were always worried , would dory 's short-term memory make her forget whatever she was being told by marlin . ''
but under that was this global tension of will we ever find nemo in this huge , vast ocean ?
`` you 've got to remember that in this time of year , 1993 , what was considered a successful animated picture was `` '' the little mermaid , '' '' `` '' beauty and the beast , '' '' `` aladdin , '' `` lion king . '' ''
we did n't have any influence then , so we had a little secret list of rules that we kept to ourselves .
and the irony is that , in the first year , our story was not working at all and disney was panicking .
another fundamental thing we learned was about liking your main character .
`` and we had naively thought , well woody in `` '' toy story '' '' has to become selfless at the end , so you 've got to start from someplace . ''
mr. potato head : you going to make us , woody ?
slinky ? slink ... slinky !
as : so how do you make a selfish character likable ?
we 're all willing to play by the rules and follow things along , as long as certain conditions are met .
and before i 'd even decided to make storytelling my career , i can now see key things that happened in my youth that really sort of opened my eyes to certain things about story .
i could n't get enough of it .
and it was n't until , on one of my later viewings , that the veil was lifted and it was in a scene where he 's walked across the sinai desert and he 's reached the suez canal , and i suddenly got it .
cyclist : who are you ? who are you ?
a strong theme is always running through a well-told story .
come on . get up .
wonder is honest , it 's completely innocent .
it ca n't be artificially evoked .
it 's like a dormant command that suddenly is activated in you , like a call to devil 's tower .
do unto others what 's been done to you .
the best stories infuse wonder .
and he said i had a matching pair like that on my head , but i could n't see them because of my hair .
as : and that 's the first story lesson i ever learned .
it means capturing a truth from your experiencing it , expressing values you personally feel deep down in your core .
and we would come in and talk to them , usually for about a week .
and yet , speculative though the idea surely is , i aim to convince you that there 's reason for taking it seriously , as it just might be right .
in part two , i 'll offer a solution to that mystery .
okay , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer edwin hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretching , it 's expanding .
here it is .
when the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up , look at what they found .
and the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
now you might wonder , should you care ?
well it 's an approach to realize einstein 's dream of a unified theory of physics , a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe .
but the theory says that if you could probe smaller , much smaller than we can with existing technology , you 'd find something else inside these particles — a little tiny vibrating filament of energy , a little tiny vibrating string .
so particle masses , the strengths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions .
from five , the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands — a large , but still manageable , collection to analyze , since after all , graduate students need something to do .
maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other .
which means we have been asking the wrong question .
because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies , the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies do n't form .
and in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies do n't form .
and that would be that .
we 're used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe .
but the point is , if the feature you 're observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality , then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided .
kepler was asking the wrong question .
so hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number , 93 million miles , well that is simply wrongheaded .
and those planets that are much farther away from the star , well they 're so cold that , again , our form of life would not take hold .
it tells us how the universe evolved after the bang , but gives us no insight into what would have powered the bang itself .
the different shapes yield different physical features .
and we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it 's only in our universe that the physical features , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold .
well let me describe one way that might one day happen .
you see , we learned that our universe is not static , that space is expanding , that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies .
and they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit — a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong .
now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era , like ours , attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies .
it appears that it may not always be that way .
the range of ideas you 've just spoken about are dizzying , exhilarating , incredible .
we can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago — and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
`` a little bit further on in the article it said `` '' a loss that would normally take the ice shelf 50-100 years to replace . '' '' that same word , `` '' normal , '' '' had two different , almost opposite meanings . ''
i 'm sorry , there 's nothing normal about this .
only 90 days after this , arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred .
and i wondered , what if the answer to some of our biggest problems could be found in the smallest of places , where the difference between what is valuable and what is worthless is merely the addition or subtraction of a few atoms ?
so i started to go around the world finding the best and brightest scientists i could at universities whose collective discoveries have the chance to take us there , and we formed a company to build on their extraordinary ideas .
in winter , exactly the opposite is happening .
would n't it be really great if the window could flick back the heat into the room if we needed it or flick it away before it came in ?
how is that possible ?
carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible .
this lets you do it .
transparency is key .
what if we combined it with this ?
suddenly you 've converted energy into an electron on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window .
but because it 's flexible , it can be on any surface whatsoever .
in terms of dollars per what 's stored , it 's simply the best .
knowing that we 're not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power , we went to a group at university of texas at dallas , and we gave them this diagram .
ebox is testing new nanomaterials to park an electron on the outside , hold it until you need it , and then be able to release it and pass it off .
the grid of tomorrow is no grid , and energy , clean efficient energy , will one day be free .
if you do this , you get the last puzzle piece , which is water .
each of us , every day , need just eight glasses of this , because we 're human .
19 trillion dollars is what we 're going to have to spend .
in fact , it 's going to require twice the world 's supply of oil to run the pumps to generate the water .
i 'm glad to be working with incredibly brilliant and kind scientists , no kinder than many of the people in the world , but they have a magic look at the world .
and i 'm glad to see their discoveries coming out of the lab and into the world .
by any standard this is wrong .
we can do better than this .
you do n't have enough time .
`` there 's something much more interesting around the corner , '' '' i say , `` '' try saying that to her . '' '' that 's what i say in my mind . and i just say `` '' thank you , '' '' and i go on to the next one . ''
this is why we have to solve our problems , and i know the answer as to how is to be able to get exquisite control over a building block of nature , the stuff of life : the simple electron .
thank you .
now , the big bang was an era in the early universe when everything we see in the night sky was condensed into an incredibly small , incredibly hot , incredibly roiling mass , and from it sprung everything we see .
we 've mapped the afterglow with spectacular precision , and one of the shocks about it is that it 's almost completely uniform .
but the really crazy idea is that our bubble is just one bubble in a much larger , roiling pot of universal stuff .
we 're never going to see the stuff outside , but by going to the south pole and spending three years looking at the detailed structure of the night sky , we can figure out that we 're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that .
thanks a lot .
we go to a full-frame view of this .
and this gained einstein prominence around the world .
rather , they produce the different particles making up the world around us .
it 's built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy , vibrating in different frequencies .
but the question i asked is , is it possible to linger in the stratosphere ?
the main advantage of this system is weight and complexity .
i 'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now .
if anything goes wrong , i want to be ready .
there 's the balloon going by a second time .
right now , i 'm about at the speed of sound .
( video ) ground control : we lost the data .
and what i 'm going to try and do is plant some ideas about how we can transform inorganic , dead matter into living matter , into inorganic biology .
before we do that , i want to kind of put biology in its place .
and when i talk about darwinian evolution , i mean one thing and one thing only , and that is survival of the fittest .
and so forget about evolution in a kind of metaphysical way .
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer .
and in fact , the smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is , in fact , a single cell — a bacteria .
and as i pause for a few seconds , have a look at the screen .
you can see there 's architecture growing , filling the void .
let 's see if we can actually make life .
in fact , we were the only people in the universe .
`` so as a chemist , i wanted to say , `` '' hang on . what is going on here ? ''
in biology , carbon takes center stage .
and in a universe where carbon exists and organic biology , then we have all this wonderful diversity of life .
so we have to think differently if we 're going to make stuff come alive .
and we also have to be aware of the issues .
synthetic biologists are manipulating it .
well , i like think of it as a flame in a bottle .
and darwin himself mused in a letter to a colleague that he thought that life probably emerged in some warm little pond somewhere — maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
the rna people would talk about the rna world .
we then got to the last ancestor .
evolution kicked in — and that 's the cool bit .
but there 's a roadblock that you ca n't get past .
i 'm not a politician , i 'm a scientist .
and this one happens to be a good source of all 20 amino acids .
but life begins , what does that mean ?
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
so in the 1950s , miller-urey did their fantastic chemical frankenstein experiment , where they did the equivalent in the chemical world .
so what we 're trying to do is do reactions — not in one flask , but in tens of flasks , and connect them together , as you can see with this flow system , all these pipes .
this is how i remember what i need as a chemist .
`` i say , `` '' well i want molecules . '' '' but i need a metabolism , i need some energy . ''
because if i want evolution , i need containers to compete .
so what we 're going to try and do is come up with an inorganic lego kit of molecules .
there 's only maybe three or four different types of building blocks present .
and just a few months ago in my lab , we were able to take these very same molecules and make cells with them .
and we 're now going to put some chemistry inside and do some chemistry in this cell .
does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe ?
so you imagine , if we 're able to create a self-sustaining artificial life form , not only will this tell us about the origin of life — that it 's possible that the universe does n't need carbon to be alive ; it can use anything — we can then take [ it ] one step further and develop new technologies , because we can then use software control for evolution to code in .
so this will reorganize the way we design things .
but not only just that , we will start to think about how we can start to develop a symbiotic relationship with biology .
so what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life ?
when ?
we 're proposing to do it in just a few hours , once we 've set up the right chemistry .
because the thing is , we are so chauvinistic to biology , if you take away carbon , there 's other things that can happen .
we also have seven-day executive programs .
and coming up next month is actually future med , a program to help cross-train and leverage technologies into medicine .
where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iphone and check yourself for an std .
and we 're layering multiple technologies — pet scans , ct scans and molecular diagnostics — to find and to seek things at different levels .
we can look inside with real time fmri — in the brain at real time .
the scanners for these are getting small , less expensive and more portable .
how would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick ?
well now there 's essentially a virtual colonoscopy .
compare those two pictures , and now as a radiologist , you can essentially fly through your patient 's colon and , augmenting that with artificial intelligence , identify potentially , as you see here , a lesion .
oh , we might have missed it , but using a.i . on top of radiology , we can find lesions that were missed before .
and maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that would n't have otherwise .
we 're moving to this integration of biomedicine , information technology , wireless and , i would say , mobile now — this era of digital medicine .
and of course , there 's an app for that .
but now that we 're switching to merging medical data , making it available electronically , we can crowd source that information , and now as a physician , i can access my patients ' data from wherever i am just through my mobile device .
only for about 20 percent of actual visits do you have to lay hands on the patient .
we 're now in the era of virtual visits — from sort of the skype-type visits you can do with american well , to cisco that 's developed a very complex health presence system .
or might we be able to leverage today 's gaming technology , like the microsoft kinect , and hack that to enable diagnostics , for example , in diagnosing stroke , using simple motion detection , using hundred-dollar devices .
i can measure my steps , my caloric outtake .
i can share that with my friends , with my physician .
there 's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate .
probably in a few years , you 'll check into your mirror and it 's going to be diagnosing you .
so the surgeon can see inside the patient , through their lens , where the tumor is , where the blood vessels are .
and we 're entering an era of really , truly scarless surgery called notes , where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically .
and these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients .
so we 're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually .
if you have n't lost a limb — you 've had a stroke , for example — you can wear these augmented limbs .
clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction , including with huge costs .
but the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller .
you can swallow this completely integrated device .
sometimes these might self-assemble in your gi system and be augmented in that reality .
here 's one that 's in prototyping by medtronic that 's smaller than a penny .
how about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone again to see at a microscopic level and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics ?
in fact , the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing .
microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians .
if we go down the small pathway a little bit farther , we 're entering the era of nanomedicine , the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system , or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries .
not something we usually think about in the era of medicine , but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars for 10 megabytes — exponentially cheaper .
in genomics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
what are we going to do with hundred-dollar genomes ?
and soon we 'll have millions of these tests available .
i 'm at almost twice the risk for type 2 diabetes .
it might change my behavior .
we can capture that information .
so genomics , proteomics , the environment , all this data streaming at us individually and us , as poor physicians , how do we manage it ?
we 're going to be predictive ; we 're going to know what you 're likely to have .
we can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized ; and more importantly , it 's going to become increasingly participatory .
through websites like patients like me or managing your data on microsoft healthvault or google health , leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important .
so if you think of cancer as a weed , we often can whack the weed away .
we use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation .
we take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack , we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack .
i invented a device called the marrowminer , a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow .
if you think about it , every cell in your body has the same dna as you had when you were an embryo .
and i think by pulling these things together , if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these , we 're going to empower the patient , enable the doctor , enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick .
so by leveraging these technologies together , i think we 'll enter a new era that i like to call stage 0 medicine .
it is a fake place . it 's a paper town .
like the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps .
the way that we choose — sort of , our personal cartographic enterprise , also shapes the map of our lives , and that in turn shapes our lives .
so i was a really terrible student when i was a kid .
that 's not a recipe for a happy life .
and then , when i was in tenth grade , i went to this school , indian springs school , a small boarding school , outside of birmingham , alabama .
and so i started to learn , because learning was cool .
and along the way , the map of my life got better .
it got bigger ; it contained more places .
i might know , you know , cantor 's idea that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets , but i did n't really understand the calculus behind that idea .
here 's ze talking about las vegas : ( video ) ze frank : las vegas was built in the middle of a huge , hot desert .
almost everything here was brought from somewhere else — the sort of rocks , the trees , the waterfalls .
so we played ze frank at chess collaboratively , and we beat him .
so i guess that 's why they allow infinite series in the curriculum .
today 's question is : why ?
i was born in calcutta — a family where my father and his father before him were journalists , and they wrote magazines in the english language .
and that 's actually a shop in calcutta , but it 's a place where we like our books .
and two of the things about bengal : they like their savory dishes and they like their sweets .
so by the time i grew up , again , i had a well-established passion for food .
now i was growing up in the late '60s and early '70s , and there were a number of other passions i was also interested in , but these two were the ones that differentiated me .
`` everything was okay , until i got to about the age of 26 , and i went to a movie called `` '' short circuit . '' '' oh , some of you have seen it . ''
and as i went to research that even further , i got to a point where i discovered something called the expensive tissue hypothesis .
and the paper then suggested that you traded one for the other .
that then set me off completely to say , okay , these two are connected .
so i looked at the cultivation of information as if it were food and said , so we were hunter-gathers of information .
because those people who were hunter-gatherers in origin wanted to be free and roam and pick up information as they wanted , and those that were in the business of farming information wanted to build fences around it , create ownership and wealth and structure and settlement .
one group of people said you can distill your information , you can extract value , separate it and serve it up , while another group turned around and said no , no you can ferment it .
the same is true every time as i started thinking about information .
i put it to you that information , if viewed from the point of food , is never a production issue ; you never speak of food overload .
and we have to start thinking about how we create diets within ourselves , exercise within ourselves , to have the faculties to be able to deal with information , to have the labeling to be able to do it responsibly .
but i 'd like to leave you with just that question : if you began to think of all the information that you consume the way you think of food , what would you do differently ?
( applause )
the first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
it 's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced — or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
you do n't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
meanwhile the exact same year , at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
i personally do n't accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so i decided to change that .
a few years ago i started developing littlebits .
let me show you how they work .
they 're pre-engineered to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you 've made a little blinker .
so beyond simple play , littlebits are actually pretty powerful .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
we 've been giving littlebits to kids and seeing them play with them .
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they do n't learn at schools .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottles , we have geordie making ...
( laughter ) to these non-engineers , littlebits became another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
thank you .
at five years old , i had to take an hour-long bus ride to a faraway place to get a better education .
all these amazing things that i was being exposed to and experiencing , i felt i was n't really supposed to have .
my kids deserve so much better .
`` we sit and we keep banging our heads against this term : `` achievement gap , achievement gap ! '' ''
ever since then , every court case , educational policy , reform , has been an attempt to retrofit the design , rather than just stopping and acknowledging : we 've had it all wrong from the beginning .
enter brown v. the board of education of topeka , kansas in 1954 ; legal separation of the races is now illegal .
for years , i tried desperately to cultivate in my kids a love of reading .
`` the whole experience hit home for me when one of my girls , as she peeled open a crisp paperback said , `` '' ms. sumner — you know , i figured you bought these books , 'cause you teachers are always buying us stuff . ''
it was n't that they did n't want to read , but instead , they 'd gladly read if the resources were there .
really ?
if your son or daughter or niece or nephew or neighbor or little timmy down the street goes to an affluent school , challenge your school committee to adopt an impoverished school or an impoverished classroom .
and on a micro level : if you 're a human being , donate .
what is a carpenter with no tools ?
what is a scientist with no laboratory ?
i 'll tell you : they 're my kids .
and here 's what the checklisted childhood looks like .
well , we parents , we parents are pretty sure it 's all worth it .
but really , here 's why .
the longest longitudinal study of humans ever conducted is called the harvard grant study .
i have to admit something to you .
thank you .
my sister is a special ed teacher in chicago .
my father just retired after 25 years teaching fifth grade .
they taught me that the only way to get the right answers is to ask the right questions .
there 's obviously many important questions , but i think the following is a good place to start : what do we think the connection is between a child 's growing mind and their growing body ?
and with all the resources that we are pouring into schools , we should stop and ask ourselves : are we really setting our kids up for success ?
except for this episode — it was a very special one .
in this episode , the main-course mystery ingredient was quinoa .
( laughter ) so i took on the tv accusatory judge thing that you 're supposed to do , and i asked her why she did that .
allison will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid .
she 'll have to visit the nurse less .
well , unfortunately , it 's pervasive .
on the one hand , one in six americans are food insecure , including 16 million children — almost 20 percent — are food insecure .
but then by the end of the month , food stamps run out or hours get cut at work , and they do n't have the money to cover the basic cost of food .
as part of my work at the white house , we instituted a program that for all schools that had 40 percent more low-income kids , we could serve breakfast and lunch to every kid in that school .
so everybody knew who was poor and who needed government help .
his name from eric parker , and he was the head football coach for the burke county bears .
but the year donna changed the menus , the bears not only won their division , they went on to win the state championship , beating the peach county trojans 28-14 .
when we give our kids the basic nourishment , they 're going to thrive .
food is that place where our collective efforts can have the greatest impact .
so we have to ask ourselves : what is the right question ?
what would be the impact ?
still a lot of you . ok .
social profiles and reviews help people make a choice .
you can see if someone 's a smoker , you can see what kind of music they like , you can see if they 're going to bring their dog along for the ride .
blablacar is a beautiful illustration of how technology is enabling millions of people across the world to take a trust leap .
there is a man staring at me with his eyes wide open .
you got it ?
there are , in fact , hundreds of definitions of trust , and most can be reduced to some kind of risk assessment of how likely it is that things will go right .
so i define trust a little differently .
`` but from studying hundreds of networks and marketplaces , there is a common pattern that people follow , and i call it `` '' climbing the trust stack . '' '' let me use blablacar as an example to bring it to life . ''
and the third level is about using little bits of information to decide whether the other person is trustworthy .
in other words , trust enables change and innovation .
the man who had his eyes wide open , he might lend it to me , and if i did n't pay him back , you 'd all know i was dodgy .
every time something moves from one place on the register to somewhere else , that asset transfer is time-stamped and publicly recorded on the blockchain .
now , we will see cases of abuse of distributed trust .
we share our homes with people we do not know .
this is just the beginning , because the real disruption happening is n't technological .
it 's the trust shift it creates , and for my part , i want to help people understand this new era of trust so that we can get it right and we can embrace the opportunities to redesign systems that are more transparent , inclusive and accountable .
her name is yahli .
machine learning is now capable of far , far more complex tasks .
an ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes .
so what does this mean for the future of work ?
on frequent , high-volume tasks , machines are getting smarter and smarter .
thank you .
advertisers would withdraw their advertising .
this was like the democratization of justice .
( laughter ) another one in a monitor screen in his eye line .
that month , between december the 20th and the end of december , her name was googled 1,220,000 times .
on twitter that night , we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun .
she was got because she was perceived to have misused her privilege .
and of course , that 's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for , like having children out of wedlock .
jon ronson : thanks , bruno .
and i assume you did n't only have friendly reactions on twitter .
jr : it did n't go down that well with some people .
bg : jon , thank you . jr : thank you , bruno .
so there we have it .
`` at this point , we said , `` '' let 's just stop . ''
we ca n't do it for them . they have to do it for themselves .
now , as it turns out , this is not that alien of a problem .
( applause )
we observe the cells in a plate , and they 're just on the surface .
i do n't give a damn about democracy and liberty .
yes , there 's a real problem of extremist content spreading all over the internet .
but ...
i reframe that as a positive because the crazier i get onstage , the more entertaining i become .
( laughter ) i was sent to a place , a psych ward , and in the psych ward , everyone is doing their own one-man show . ( laughter )
there 's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time .
the first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode , and the second half was the overmedications of these drugs , where i was sleeping through high school .
when i got out i had a choice .
`` a different book was written not too long ago in the mid-90s called `` '' touched with fire '' '' by kay redfield jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which mozart and beethoven and van gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with . ''
so it was n't all the good side of the illness .
just be manic enough in which investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum — you know what i 'm talking about — not maybe full bipolar , but they 're in the bipolar spectrum — where on one side , maybe you think you 're jesus , and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money .
and everyone 's somewhere in the middle .
everyone is just a little bit mad .
and she was quiet , too quiet .
it stems from a lifelong interest of mine in , believe it or not , poverty .
that 's not even close .
some of you remember that picture , not exactly that picture , one just like it .
it introduced the west to grinding poverty around the world .
that 's something we ought to celebrate .
and here it is .
number four : rule of law .
but that is great .
capitalism is not just about accumulation .
why do i know it by heart ?
crazy .
you expect to see this between palestinians and israelis , for example .
he 's a psychology professor at new york university .
he does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ .
it 's a tricky thing , is n't it .
do n't we ?
do you ever feel like your own ideology is starting to get predictable ?
why is that dangerous ?
so how are we going to do it ? how are we going to do it together ?
we have to remember that we need people who disagree with us , because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools .
where does this start ? it starts here .
and then maybe , just maybe , we 'll all realize that our big differences are n't really that big after all .
thank you .
well , i thought there would be a podium , so i 'm a bit scared .
this is someone selling this on ebay ; it was clearly a woman’s hand , hopefully a woman 's hand .
this is where it gets weird .
well , not quite , not quite perfect .
now , i 'm a physicist , but i 'm not the right kind of physicist .
chris anderson : we had edward snowden here a couple days ago , and this is response time .
rl : no , i do n't agree with that .
they actually do .
where 's the cure for insomnia ?
you see that ethnobotanists have friends in all sorts of strange cultures .
it 's a place of beauty and wonder .
let 's move to the western amazon , which is really the epicenter of isolated peoples .
here 's why .
this is an art exhibit in havana , cuba .
these are the uray people in brazil .
seriously , but dangerously fun .
( applause )
before , they were closed off .
and think of the laptop as a vaccine .
that 's where maureen went to school .
they often hit their target but miss the point .
`` he called out one word in the darkness : `` bye . '' ''
but the tragedy convinced me that i failed as a parent , and it 's partially this sense of failure that brings me here today .
for years after the tragedy , i combed through memories , trying to figure out exactly where i failed as a parent .
when i talk to people who did n't know me before the shootings , i have three challenges to meet .
the second challenge i have is that i must ask for understanding and even compassion when i talk about my son 's death as a suicide .
later , when she found me alone , she apologized for overhearing that conversation , but told me that i was wrong .
at the time , she was certain that her children would be better off if she died , so she had made a plan to end her life .
even though they can make a plan and act with logic , their sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain through which they interpret their reality .
but my son 's death was not purely a suicide .
it involved mass murder .
he had a personality that was perfectionistic and self-reliant , and that made him less likely to seek help from others .
it 's the second leading cause of death for people age 10 to 34 , and 15 percent of american youth report having made a suicide plan in the last year .
i know there are even some who think i do n't have the right to any pain , but only to a life of permanent penance .
thank you .
i love being a police officer because it 's always been a calling for me and never a job .
so we did n't retire .
so i met them and i began to listen .
everybody makes up a community .
but we have surrendered so much of our responsibility .
you know who came ? it was the elders .
`` they came and said , `` '' stop that ! '' '' and `` '' do this . '' '' and `` '' stop that . '' '' we had mentors throughout all of the community . ''
so you now have churches who have become disconnected by default from the very community where they 're planted .
i could go on and on , but i really need to wrap this up .
we all take responsibility in this .
you see , after three years
`` whatcha doin ' ? we got ta get some of that ! '' '' ( laughter ) and so we gave them some of that . ''
if we continued in that vein , it would 've never happened .
this nation will become great again .
here , you can see men went eight years .
there must be preconceived ideas , you know .
so this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle .
it was good in evolution .
this is very widespread .
that will help you score better on our tests .
that 's what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing , a better life for people .
so there 's good news .
`` but then i hear people saying , `` '' there is no progress in africa . ''
and i will take kenya as an example .
here you see the data .
and this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about [ her ] birth history .
have got these surveys in place in their database , then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line , and the trend line looks like this .
but watch out — they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing .
and i was sad , because we could see this reversal in kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s .
this was the estimate of the new survey .
is n't it nice — is n't it nice , yeah ?
as a professor , i think i have the right to propose something differently .
they have 2.4 percent .
now this sounds a little theoretical , but it 's not so theoretical .
but even this is not a fair representation of africa , because it 's an average , it 's an average speed of reduction in africa .
congo got into civil war , and they leveled off here .
this was the backlash in kenya , and ghana bypassed , but then kenya and ghana go down together — still a standstill in congo .
that 's where we are today .
you can see it does n't make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement .
my country , sweden : 1800 , we were up there .
sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early .
so we are off track — that 's what sweden is .
but you do n't talk about it so much .
we want others to be better than we were , and indeed , others have been better .
they had high , or very high , child mortality and family size , six to eight .
and the ones over there , they were so-called western countries .
they had low child mortality and small families .
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in .
`` it 's very good — `` '' levels and trends in child mortality '' '' — except this page . ''
but it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind , because it 's about the environment .
2012 was set to be a very international year for the uk ; it was the year of the london olympics .
and so i decided to use it as my time frame to try to read a novel , short story collection or memoir from every country in the world .
having spent my life reading almost exclusively british and north american books , i had no idea how to go about sourcing and finding stories and choosing them from much of the rest of the world .
so how on earth was i going to read the world ?
now , i had no idea whether anyone would be interested , but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online , people started to get in touch .
but perhaps the most amazing example of the lengths that people were prepared to go to to help me read the world , came towards the end of my quest , when i tried to get hold of a book from the tiny , portuguese-speaking african island nation of são tomé and príncipe .
and i sent a copy out to each of my volunteers .
when it came to são tomé and príncipe , it was a chance not only to learn something new and discover a new collection of stories , but also to bring together a group of people and facilitate a joint creative endeavor .
my weakness had become the project 's strength .
wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking .
now , i do n't want to suggest that it 's at all possible to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book .
but cumulatively , the stories i read that year made me more alive than ever before to the richness , diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet .
it 's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together .
and i hope many more people will join me .
( applause )
it leaves the listener feeling sickly .
so we reached out to traditional political parties and we offered them democracyos .
it 's called the arab spring .
anyone heard of it ?
but before tahrir was a global symbol of liberation , there were representative surveys already giving people a voice in quieter but still powerful ways .
i 'm going to focus a lot of my talk on egypt .
but it 's the largest arab country and it 's also one with a great deal of influence .
so after analyzing mounds of data , what we discovered was this : unemployment and poverty alone did not lead to the arab revolts of 2011 .
on paper the country was doing great .
in fact , it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
but it was exactly the opposite in egypt .
but it was n't just anger at economic injustice .
contrary to the clash of civilizations theory , arabs did n't despise western liberty , they desired it .
the military council has cracked down on civil society and protests and the country 's economy continues to suffer .
whether they support islamists or liberals , egyptians ' priorities for this government are identical , and they are jobs , stability and education , not moral policing .
but most of all , for the first time in decades , they expect to be active participants , not spectators , in the affairs of their country .
in the country once known for its passive resignation , where , as bad as things got , only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official , today 90 percent tell us that if there 's a problem in their community , it 's up to them to fix it .
what about men 's views of religion and law ?
and the transformation continues .
after i graduated from the yale law school and got my first law job , my new haven analyst , dr. white , announced to me that he was going to close his practice in three months , several years before i had planned to leave new haven .
steve would later tell me that , for all the times he had seen me psychotic , nothing could have prepared him for what he saw that day .
for a week or more , i had barely eaten .
i was gaunt . i walked as though my legs were wooden .
'hi , ' i said , and then i returned to the couch , where i sat in silence for several moments .
'i 'm being pushed into a grave . the situation is grave , ' i moan .
'gravity is pulling me down .
i 'd like to share with you how that happened , and also describe my experience of being psychotic .
schizophrenia is a brain disease .
occasionally , i have hallucinations , like one time i turned around and saw a man with a raised knife .
`` loose associations involves putting together words that may sound a lot alike but do n't make sense , and if the words get jumbled up enough , it 's called `` '' word salad . '' '' contrary to what many people think , schizophrenia is not the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality . ''
the schizophrenic mind is not split , but shattered .
this person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia .
and then , late on a friday night , on the roof of the yale law school , i began to sing , and not quietly either .
come to the florida sunshine bush , where there are lemons , where they make demons . ' 'you 're frightening me , ' one of them said , and rebel and val headed back into the library .
`` sitting on my bed , i rocked back and forth , moaning in fear and isolation . '' '' this episode led to my first hospitalization in america . ''
a sound came out of my mouth that i 'd never heard before : half groan , half scream , barely human and pure terror .
`` one of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me against my will was that i was `` gravely disabled . '' ''
i wondered what that meant about much of the rest of new haven .
i never struck anyone .
they strangle , they aspirate their vomit , they suffocate , they have a heart attack .
they 're different from me and you .
we do n't like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would .
all around me i sensed evil beings poised with daggers .
kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony . ' even in this state , what he accurately described as acutely and forwardly psychotic , i refused to take more medication .
once in his office , i sat on his couch , folded over , and began muttering .
tell them not to kill me . what have i done wrong ?
i could get you admitted right away , and the whole thing could be very discrete . ' 'ha , ha , ha .
hospitals are bad , they 're mad , they 're sad .
`` he said , `` '' did you quit or were you fired ? '' '' ( laughter ) `` '' 'i give life and i take it away . ''
third , i work at an enormously supportive workplace at usc law school .
also , we must stop criminalizing mental illness .
it 's a national tragedy and scandal that the l.a. county jail is the biggest psychiatric facility in the united states .
please , continue to let us see characters in your movies , your plays , your columns , who suffer with severe mental illness .
`` he declined , saying , `` '' do n't take my devils away , because my angels may flee too . '' '' my psychosis , on the other hand , is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying that all my angels have already fled . ''
that said , i do n't wish to be seen as regretting the life i could have had if i 'd not been mentally ill , nor am i asking anyone for their pity .
it 's a pretty accurate description .
some malicious code today goes as far as targeting power , utilities and infrastructure .
today 's cybercriminal , what do they look like ?
check out this one i found .
things got a bit tricky when i tried to expense it at the company .
turns out that 's not cool .
but it goes further .
now , there are many ways you can get infected .
you will have come in contact with some of them .
`` maybe some of you have received an email that says something like , `` '' hi , i 'm a nigerian banker , and i 'd like to give you 53 billion dollars because i like your face . '' '' or funnycats.exe , which rumor has it was quite successful in china 's recent campaign against america . ''
this is a little usb key .
so imagine this scenario : i walk into one of your businesses , looking very awkward and pathetic , with a copy of my c.v .
malware is very boring otherwise .
you can turn on the webcam .
that can be very embarrassing .
so is n't it amazing how much control the attackers can get with such a simple operation ?
and it 's got a comments section here where we can submit comments to the website .
so let 's imagine that our attacker , called evil hacker just for comedy value , inserts something a little nasty .
so i 'm going to submit this post , and then , on my victim computer , i 'm going to open up the web browser and browse to my website , www.incrediblyhacked.com .
if you look closely , you 'll notice a series of what are russian telephone numbers .
and our cybercriminals had done the same thing .
so here 's a photo which resolves to st. petersburg .
imagine , these are hardened cybercriminals sharing information scarcely .
a bit more searching through the profile and there 's a photo of their office .
but this is where our investigation starts to slow down .
our friends , our families and our colleagues can break our security even when we do the right things .
and it 's kind of like she went into her social media settings and clicked on every option imaginable to make herself really , really insecure .
let me come back to that in just a minute .
so i ran a little scan .
tedattendees , hyattlb . where do you think i 'm staying ?
sophos_visitors , sansemea , companies i work with .
loganwifi , that 's in boston . hiltonlondon .
so let 's make this a little bit more interesting .
twenty-three percent of you have been to starbucks recently and used the wireless network .
forty-six percent of you i could link to a business , xyz employee network .
`` would someone be able to abuse it ? '' '' we also need to think very carefully about how we develop our future talent pool . ''
find these resources . apply them .
the internet is a fantastic resource for business , for political expression , for art and for learning .
help me and the security community make life much , much more difficult for cybercriminals .
thank you .
we 're all one family .
but it 's not just what he stood for , it 's what his message was .
all borders are closed on every side .
when it 's cold , we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes .
in the tradition of the palestinian society , it 's forbidden for men to enter the household .
i have a wonderful husband , a wonderful husband who supports me despite all the criticism he gets from the society .
there are some more stories i could tell you about my country .
( laughter ) hp : ( in chinese ) yr : the only problem with masking it with chinese mandarin is i can only speak this paragraph , which i have learned by heart when i was visiting in china . ( laughter ) so all i can do is keep repeating it in different tones and hope you wo n't notice . ( laughter ) hp : ( in chinese ) ( laughter )
it felt a bit girly to me , like a dress , and it had this baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down .
`` hp : ( in chinese ) yr : actually , the only way i feel comfortable wearing it is by pretending they are the robes of a kung fu warrior like li mu bai from that film , `` crouching tiger , hidden dragon . '' ''
so my artwork is about identity and language , challenging common assumptions based on how we look like or where we come from , gender , race , class .
i have been wondering recently , if he were alive today , what advice he would give me about making this ted talk .
it offends me .
who here has n't imitated their childhood hero in the playground , or mum or father ?
hp : a few years ago , in order to make this video for my artwork , i shaved off all my hair so that i could grow it back as my father had it when he first emigrated from india to the u.k. in the 1960s .
instead , people from across the road , they would shout things like — hp and yr : arriba ! arriba ! ándale ! ándale !
so it 's not just my father that i 've imitated .
a few years ago i went to china for a few months , and i could n't speak chinese , and this frustrated me , so i wrote about this and had it translated into chinese , and then i learned this by heart , like music , i guess .
it does n't always go as you plan it , even with a talented translator .
it 's only recently that i 've started to understand that i did n't learn to sit like this through being indian .
( laughter ) thank you .
forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet .
all those things , the eggs , the cysts , the bacteria , the viruses , all those can travel in one gram of human feces .
he 's barefoot . he 'll run back into his house , and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet .
where i come from , we call it delhi belly , as a legacy of empire .
( laughter ) still not sure about the bikini .
you ca n't see her , because she 's buried under that green grass in a little village in liberia , because she died in three days from diarrhea — the hershey squirts , the runs , a joke .
it 's a very potent weapon of mass destruction .
and the cost to the world is immense : 260 billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation .
you 'll have heard of cholera , but we do n't hear about diarrhea .
but we know how to fix this .
we know , because in the mid-19th century , wonderful victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet , and disease dropped dramatically .
the flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last 200 years by the readers of the british medical journal , and they were choosing over the pill , anesthesia , and surgery .
it 's a wonderful waste disposal device .
but i think that it 's so good — it does n't smell , we can put it in our house , we can lock it behind a door — and i think we 've locked it out of conversation too .
and i think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development , because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us .
so a toilet can put a girl back in school .
`` so if you met an educationalist and said , `` '' i can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent with just one simple thing , '' '' you 'd make a lot of friends in education . ''
poop can cook your dinner .
in rwanda , they are now getting 75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners ' bowels .
so these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in butare .
they 're genocidal inmates , most of them , and they 're stirring the contents of their own latrines , because if you put poop in a sealed environment , in a tank , pretty much like a stomach , then , pretty much like a stomach , it gives off gas , and you can cook with it .
so you 'd be thinking by now , okay , the solution 's simple , we give everyone a toilet .
and this is where it gets really interesting , because it 's not that simple , because we are not simple .
so the idea is to manipulate human emotion .
it 's been done for decades . the soap companies did it in the early 20th century .
she 'd grown up with a latrine .
and she was scared . she was scared of drunks hanging around .
and if you know anything about rural india , you 'll know that 's an unspeakably courageous thing to do .
but not just that .
she got her toilet , and now she goes around all the other villages in india persuading other women to do the same thing .
another version of this , another village in india near where priyanka lives is this village , called lakara , and about a year ago , it had no toilets whatsoever .
her entire life , she 'd been using the banana field behind , but she installed the latrine in a few hours .
but there are things to worry about .
it 's the most off-track millennium development goal .
it 's about 50 or so years off track .
so when i get sad about sanitation , i think of japan , because japan 70 years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks , and now it 's a nation of what are called woshurettos , washlet toilets .
people go out and upgrade their toilet .
they talk about it . they 've sanitized it .
things are going wrong here too .
thank you .
as a consequence , reporters do n't lead with them , policymakers do n't think about them , and politicians are n't encouraged or demanded that they speak to them .
but it does n't have to be this way .
emma degraffenreid was an african-american woman , a working wife and a mother .
she wanted to create a better life for her children and for her family .
now , the judge in question dismissed emma 's suit , and the argument for dismissing the suit was that the employer did hire african-americans and the employer hired women .
they 've been killed on the street .
they 've been killed in front of their parents and they 've been killed in front of their children .
they have been shot to death .
they have been stomped to death .
they 've been killed shopping while black , driving while black , having a mental disability while black , having a domestic disturbance while black .
i 'd like those of you who are able to join us in saying these names as loud as you can , randomly , disorderly .
now , to close the gap , germany has to significantly increase migration , get many more women in the workforce , increase retirement age — by the way , we just lowered it this year — and all these measures at once .
what you can see here are average numbers .
if you look at the employees aged 21 to 30 , this number is even higher .
our subjects doubled their cheating .
and they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way .
`` she said , `` '' of course , you know , it was very painful for you . ''
instead of investing in a car , we invest in a community .
some people call this peer-to-peer .
it 's like saying yard sales are the same thing as ebay , or craft fairs are the same thing as etsy .
what do they bring ? they bring this fabulous diversity , expensive for companies . and what does that deliver ?
it delivers localization and customization , specialization , and all of this aspect about social networks and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there ?
the two of these are delivering the best of both worlds .
seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years , what people would do for five dollars .
etsy is providing goods that people make themselves and they 're selling it in a marketplace .
`` i know you guys out there who are businesspeople , are thinking , `` '' oh my god , i want to build one of those . ''
`` but i 'm thinking , you know , they probably had the `` '' share '' '' button a little bit brighter and to the right , and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides that are always participating on these networks . ''
there are many , many examples and i 'll give you one that is not my favorite example : insurance .
hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative , they 'd never thought of it before .
way too much money , i just ca n't even go there , with lawyers , trying to figure out how this is different , who 's responsible to whom , and the result was that we were able to provide owners protection for their own driving records and their own history .
they need a low deductible , and 24-hour roadside assistance .
so now i want to take you to the moment of — when you 're an entrepreneur , and you 've started a new company , there 's the , here 's all the stuff we do beforehand , and then the service launches . what happens ?
we can flag that and we can put it to the side , and people who are buyers and consumers do n't have to deal with it .
this would not be possible to do that in economic fashion for a traditional company .
so what 's happening is , we had the yuck side , but we actually had this real wow side .
`` a driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of france and the owner gave it to them , and said , `` '' you know what , here 's where the cliffs are , and here 's all the beaches , and this is my best beach , and this is where the best fish restaurant is . '' '' and the peers also become , peers and owners create relationships , and so at the last minute people can — a driver can say , `` '' hey , you know what , i really need the car , is it available ? '' '' and that person will say , `` sure , my wife 's at home . go pick up the keys . go do it . '' ''
so i continue to think that transportation is the center of the hard universe .
but there are all these other areas that are these profound , big problems that i know that we can work on , and people are working on them in many different sectors , but there 's this really fabulous group of things with the power of this peers , inc. model .
a rating can range from a so-called aaa , which means it 's a top-performing product , and it can go down to the level of the so-called bbb- , which means it 's a fairly risky investment .
well , ratings affect you .
the customers of these rating agencies , like countries or companies , they are paying for their own ratings , and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest .
but for ratings , a crucial element of our economy , we really do not know what all the different ingredients are .
and this is the reason why we have developed what we call forward-looking indicators .
these are indicators that give you a much better read about the socioeconomic development of a country .
and you might remember , some of you , how the cars were back then , and it was a common problem of overheating .
things have changed now . we have cars that we take across country .
so there 's no more signal for us to tell us to stop .
great , right ? well , we have similar problems in buildings .
the thick walls are great for insulation . it keeps the interior very cool during the summertime , and warm during the wintertime , and the small windows were also very good because it limited the amount of temperature transfer between the interior and exterior .
then in about the 1930s , with the advent of plate glass , rolled steel and mass production , we were able to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views , and with that came the irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces .
over time , the buildings got taller and bigger , our engineering even better , so that the mechanical systems were massive . they require a huge amount of energy .
they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere , and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities , where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas , but we also have problems that , when we lose power , we ca n't open a window here , and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again .
what i proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that .
and because it has two different coefficients of expansion , when heated , one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action .
keep in mind , with the digital technology that we have today , this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces and there 's no two pieces alike at all . every single one is different .
and so you can imagine , even in this application , that in a high-rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to 30 , 40 floors , the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface .
they breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles , and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down , and so in this project , i 'm trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too , how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building .
when you 're tired of opening and closing those blinds day after day , when you 're on vacation and there 's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls , or when there 's a power outage , and you have no electricity to rely on , these thermo-bimetals will still be working tirelessly , efficiently and endlessly . thank you . ( applause ) ( applause )
and of course , there 's been economic growth in the west .
and what will happen in the future ?
so what about the poorest two billion ?
and look at the position of the old west .
this will not happen [ again ] .
the transformation of organizations .
and second , how do we fix it ?
as a result , everything is happening in crisis mode .
or they 'll just take a superficial , one-off approach , hoping that they can return back to business as usual as soon as the crisis is over .
but it fails the fundamental goal of education : to prepare students to succeed over the long term .
so given these obstacles , what can we do to transform the way we transform organizations so rather than being exhausting , it 's actually empowering and energizing ?
under their very capable leadership , they 've actually undergone a series of transformations .
while each of these has had a very specific focus , the north star , linking and guiding all of them , has been lego 's powerful purpose : inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow .
investment and innovation ?
too many transformations are nothing more than head-count cutting exercises ; layoffs under the guise of transformation .
and , as of today , it 's made of these things .
a bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me .
absolutely remarkable .
clay was with us in port-au-prince . he was also with us in chile .
he lost purpose . he lost his community .
it 's to keep the men around him alive .
he 's got a purpose . but he comes home [ to ] kansas city , missouri , maybe he goes to college , maybe he 's got a job , but he does n't have that same sense of purpose .
going back , that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school in kansas city , missouri , joins the army , the army gives him a rifle , they send him to iraq .
he goes home to kansas city , missouri .
but you drop 25 of those veterans in joplin , missouri , they get that sense of community back .
he joins the army . the army gives him a rifle .
they send him to iraq .
he takes the uniform off . he 's no longer sergeant jones in his community . he 's now dave from kansas city .
and i personally am obsessed with morality .
i want to know if there 's a chemistry of morality . i want to know
would you like to see it ? i brought some with me .
this little syringe contains the moral molecule .
but in humans , it was only known to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women , and is released by both sexes during sex .
`` it is , '' '' he said , `` '' only a female molecule . ''
in other words , i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral .
then i had to measure morality .
i studied one single virtue : trustworthiness .
why ? i had shown in the early 2000s that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people are more prosperous .
but i 'm also a skeptic .
if you 're so virtuous , show me the money .
they all get $ 10 if they agree to show up .
`` and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , `` '' do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you earned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? '' '' the trick is you ca n't see them , you ca n't talk to them . ''
well by measuring oxytocin we found that the more money the second person received , the more their brain produced oxytocin , and the more oxytocin on board , the more money they returned .
two things .
one is that nothing in the body happens in isolation .
and i found i could do it with a nasal inhaler .
we 've also investigated non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin .
to investigate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son , and his son has terminal brain cancer .
`` now this is the same adam smith who , 17 years later , would write a little book called `` '' the wealth of nations '' '' — the founding document of economics . ''
but knowing that molecule is valuable , because it tells us how to turn up this behavior and what turns it off .
so to investigate immorality , let me bring you back now to 1980 .
opens it up and there 's a pearl necklace inside .
`` `` '' well this is very valuable . ''
we found , testing thousands of individuals , that five percent of the population do n't release oxytocin on stimulus .
so if you trust them , their brains do n't release oxytocin .
so there 's a technical word for these people in my lab .
so we , in experiments , have administered testosterone to men .
and we have testosterone .
so you may be wondering : these are beautiful laboratory experiments , do they really apply to real life ?
i did n't know a single person .
weddings cause a release of oxytocin , but they do so in a very particular way .
the bride .
she had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
why ? because we need them to be successful at reproducing to perpetuate the species .
so he was using social media in private .
so there 's tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal .
two weeks ago , i just got back from papua new guinea where i went up to the highlands — very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia .
and it 's so easy to cause people 's brains to release oxytocin .
( laughter ) thank you .
i know , right ?
you know what his unsuccessful pickup line was ?
yep . that 's what i thought .
it was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet for a major news story , a click that reverberated around the world .
do you recall a particular image of me , say , wearing a beret ?
in 1998 , i lost my reputation and my dignity .
a few days later , the starr report is released to congress , and all of those tapes and transcripts , those stolen words , form a part of it .
millions of people , often anonymously , can stab you with their words , and that 's a lot of pain , and there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you and put you in a public stockade .
it 's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online which lends itself to trolling , invasion of privacy , and cyberbullying .
one gossip website had over five million hits for this one story .
we 're in a dangerous cycle .
with every click , we make a choice .
`` researcher brené brown said , and i quote , `` shame ca n't survive empathy . '' ''
the theory of minority influence , proposed by social psychologist serge moscovici , says that even in small numbers , when there 's consistency over time , change can happen .
i 'd like to end on a personal note .
i must admit , i used to be one of them .
to the science of his day , it was a mystery .
`` he wrote : `` '' i think that tastes , odors , colors , and so on reside in consciousness . ''
what are these neurons up to ?
now , why would neuroscientists say that we do n't just construct , we reconstruct ?
well , let 's first look at a couple of examples in nature .
now , you might say , beetles , sure , they 're very simple creatures , but surely not mammals .
now , this is a bit stunning .
still , we need some help with our intuitions .
similarly , evolution has shaped us with perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive .
we 'd better take them seriously .
if you see a snake , do n't pick it up .
another objection : there 's nothing really new here .
well , not exactly .
the theory of evolution is telling us that once again , we 're wrong .
we 're misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences .
there 's something that exists when you do n't look , but it 's not spacetime and physical objects .
by peering through the lens of a telescope we discovered that the earth is not the unmoving center of reality , and by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution we discovered that spacetime and objects are not the nature of reality .
well , it opens up new possibilities .
ca : don , i could literally talk with you for hours , and i hope to do that .
like everything else , she was born ; grew to be around 30 times the mass of our sun and lived for a very long time .
and she evolved into another role in our galaxy .
but the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme .
early during my career , i could also see this kind of plot .
but then , i lost my sight .
i thought long and hard about it , when i suddenly realized that all a light curve is , is a table of numbers converted into a visual plot .
the body is something changeable — anyone may develop a disability at any point .
will they feel excommunicated as i did ?
it gives us equal opportunities to display our talents and choose what we want to do with our lives , based on interest and not based on potential barriers .
i dream of a level scientific playing field , where people encourage respect and respect each other , where people exchange strategies and discover together .
and i look at this , and i go , well , there are tools to go deeper , longer and further : submarines , rovs , even scuba diving .
and the point of going down to and living at this habitat was not to stay inside .
we had megafauna come and visit us .
we did a lot of science , and again , because of the luxury of time , we were able to do over three years of science in 31 days .
elizabeth : if it please you , sir .
so that 's what i do .
when i was a kid — i was about eight years old .
people are resourceful .
do they think we 're stupid ?
the second desire path i wanted to share is at the university of california .
and it reminds me that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design is just to launch it .
( laughter ) incredibly smart approach .
but what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars .
so you see the desire path .
our job is to pick the appropriate ones and pave over them .
is it luck ? is it chance ?
then 30,000 children in ahmedabad , and growing .
kbs : an inner city school in hyderabad .
but i have to end with the most powerful symbol of change , gandhiji .
i am holding something remarkably old .
much of this work is funded by nasa .
it 's so wide that it takes your plane one full minute to fly past it .
i am lucky enough to be part of this effort .
we must keep searching the sky for near-earth asteroids .
let me tell you one more story .
so , really , i want to design for outcomes .
so thinking about outcomes , it turns out appearances matter .
are we designing for the world that we have ?
i 'd like to start with a little experiment .
so — okay , i can now see that man running out there , and i can see that guy running out there .
they help maintain the stability and health of the oceans , and even provide services to human society .
let 's also do it for ours .
it 's doing that based on the content inside the images .
camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
and at the risk of sounding grandiose , it is the world 's loss .
because when it comes to creativity and to leadership , we need introverts doing what they do best .
now , to see the bias clearly , you need to understand what introversion is .
introversion is more about , how do you respond to stimulation , including social stimulation .
we sat in rows of desks like this , and we did most of our work pretty autonomously .
and they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
i always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts , including my beloved husband .
it 's only recently that we 've strangely begun to forget it .
it turns out that we ca n't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring , mimicking their opinions .
so — ( laughter ) you might be following the person with the best ideas , but you might not .
`` western societies , and in particular the u.s. , have always favored the man of action over the `` '' man '' '' of contemplation . ''
guess what ?
i have a suitcase full of books .
but these are not exactly my books .
just stop it .
it 's great for introverts and it 's great for extroverts .
so extroverts , maybe your suitcases are also full of books .
let 's not forget these men , who are truly dying to work .
you fight it . if you have a more modernist approach , and your perception of terrorism is almost cause-and-effect , then naturally from that , the responses that come out of it are much more asymmetrical .
both are fairly bad for your health . ( laughter ) if you look at it as a brand in those ways , what you 'll come to realize is , it 's a pretty flawed product .
they 're the people who buy into the brand , support them , facilitate them , and they 're the people we 've got to reach out to .
there 's two essential ways of doing that , if we carry on this brand theme .
the other thing to do is to knock the product , attack the brand myth , as we 've said .
we 've got to get in to those homelands .
that 's where they recruit from . that 's where they get their power and strength .
so the essentials are , we 've got to have interaction in those areas , with the terrorists , the facilitators , etc .
we 've got to practice what we preach .
`` they are somebody who can actually stand there and say , `` '' this product 's crap . i had it and i was sick for days . ''
this is my favorite part of my speech .
there was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there .
he 's going to take to alcohol , and he 's probably going to kill himself in three years . that 's the stats .
what it means is , when she sat in a restaurant in years to come , 10 years to come , 15 years to come , or she 's on the beach , every so often she 's going to start rubbing her skin , and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel .
what they 'd have done then is an invasion .
if the suicide bomber was from wales , good luck to wales , i 'd say .
today 's approach , governments have learned from their mistakes .
it 's human nature .
they 're not just going to be smart .
`` there was a famous irish terrorist who once summed up the point very beautifully . he said , `` '' the thing is , about the british government , is , is that it 's got to be lucky all the time , and we only have to be lucky once . '' '' so what we need to do is we have to effect it . ''
but of course , it 's ideas — is not something that governments do very well .
i want to go back just to before the bang , to this idea of brand , and i was talking about coke and pepsi , etc .
we see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war .
they actually want our cultural souls , and that 's why the brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this .
they were effectively [ doing ] something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franchised around the world , where there 's poverty , ignorance and injustice .
we , as i 've said , have got to hit that market , but we 've got to use our heads rather than our might .
if we perceive it in this way as a brand , or other ways of thinking at it like this , we will not resolve or counter terrorism .
there 's a bomb , people start suing .
it also meant , then , if you can imagine this , that the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket that you lived in .
they were embarrassed . their recruitment went down .
the bombs actually stopped — fact — because of this action .
there 's other examples . we have a case called almog which is to do with a bank that was , allegedly , from our point of view , giving rewards to suicide bombers .
new libya has been compassionate towards those victims , and started taking it — so it started a whole new dialogue there .
a good one is in somalia . there 's a war on piracy .
they used to be fisherman , of course , but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste in their water , so what we 're trying to do is create security and employment by bringing a coastguard along with the fisheries industry , and i can guarantee you , as that builds , al shabaab and such likes will not have the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people .
but it 's not an easy road . after the bomb , the victims are not into this .
there 's practical problems .
it 's politically risky for the protagonists and for the interlocutors . on one occasion i was doing it , every time i did a point that they did n't like , they actually threw stones at me , and when i did a point they liked , they starting shooting in the air , equally not great . ( laughter ) whatever the point , it gets to the heart of the problem , you 're doing it , you 're talking to them .
we must foster innovation , as i 've said .
the private sector has a role .
if i was to leave you with some big questions here which may change one 's perception to it , and who knows what thoughts and responses will come out of it , but did myself and my terrorist group actually need to blow you up to make our point ?
it 's those bulgakov themes , it 's that picture of jesus and the devil hand in hand in gethsemane walking into the moonlight .
it 's like the old las vegas used to be .
inexplicable versus understood . you know , too often we want to understand everything .
silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city .
i do n't like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes .
which struck me as particularly remarkable during one session with the novel when i realized that i was being swept along on this remarkable , vivid journey in translation .
now i was a comparative literature major in college , which is like an english major , only instead of being stuck studying chaucer for three months , we got to read great literature in translation from around the world .
ever since i can remember thinking consciously about such things , communication has been my central passion .
even as a child , i remember thinking that what i really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communicate it to everyone else .
`` it 's funny , my wife , daisy , whose family is littered with schizophrenics — and i mean littered with them — once said to me , `` '' chris , i already have a brother who thinks he 's god . ''
and that 's when i discovered comedy .
if i had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum , i 'd say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies .
and also because that 's where , in terms of our own self-interest , we finally begin to grasp our ability to respond , our responsibility to the rest of the world .
now as to what i mean by the best comedy and satire , i mean work that comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity .
survey after survey , from pew research to the annenberg center for public policy , has found that daily show viewers are better informed about current events than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows .
a great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick , where you think it 's going over here and then all of a sudden you 're transported over here .
i have some material about the so-called radical gay agenda , which starts off by asking , how radical is the gay agenda ?
because from what i can tell , the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military , get married and start a family .
remove it from your household .
`` now by taking the biblical epithet `` '' abomination '' '' and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence , a baby , this joke short circuits the emotional wiring behind the debate and it leaves the audience with the opportunity , through their laughter , to question its validity . ''
there are few phrases that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol than the perfect punchline .
and one last powerful attribute that comedy has as communication is that it 's inherently viral .
people ca n't wait to pass along that new great joke .
back in 1980 when comedian richard pryor accidentally set himself on fire during a freebasing accident , i was in los angeles the day after it happened and then i was in washington d.c. two days after that .
first there were drums and then knock-knock jokes .
and it turned out that joel and i were both bothered by the same thing , which was how so much of the debate was still focused on the science and how complete it was or was n't , which , to both of us , seems somewhat intentionally off point .
`` cartoon : `` '' what if it 's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing ? '' '' ( laughter ) you 've got to love that idea . ''
that 's a very simplistic view .
the second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia .
and we need to train them right .
and by the way , it 's continued to .
so i decided to engage this particular problem .
the persistence , their ability to deal with ambiguity , their ability to tackle problems that they have n't seen before .
and for the last decade or so , it 's been quite clear what being an atheist means .
to dismiss the whole of religion that way .
of course , there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels , etc .
i ca n't believe in the doctrines .
until now , these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice .
it 's almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff , or you reject the doctrine and you 're living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of cnn and walmart .
i do n't think we have to make that choice .
education is going to give us , not only commercial skills , industrial skills , it 's also going to make us better people .
and that 's a very plausible idea .
they do n't think we are in an urgent need of assistance .
now religions start from a very different place indeed .
we 're only just holding it together .
perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
but anyway , we 're only just holding it together .
and we need help . of course , we need help .
he was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons , the classic medium of delivery of religions .
the tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable , because we are in need of guidance , morality and consolation — and religions know that .
they circle the great truths again and again and again .
`` if i said to you , `` '' okay , we 're not going to have new ted . ''
`` we 're going to watch elizabeth gilbert five times because what she says is so clever , '' '' you 'd feel cheated . ''
the other things that religions do is to arrange time .
all the major religions give us calendars .
what is a calendar ?
now we do n't think that way .
take the moon . it 's really important to look at the moon .
`` you know , when you look at the moon , you think , `` '' i 'm really small . what are my problems ? '' '' it sets things into perspective , etc. , etc . ''
in the secular world , you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career .
but the religious world does n't think that way .
what you 're saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it .
all right , all right . we 're getting there . we 're getting there .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another .
religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
now i think that the potential is there , but we 've completely let ourselves down .
the two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art : the first idea is that art should be for art 's sake — a ridiculous idea — an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world .
the other thing that we believe is that art should n't explain itself , that artists should n't say what they 're up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy .
but that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art .
now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
they have no trouble telling us what art is about .
and secondly , it 's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate .
propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something .
and if that thing is good , there 's no problem with it at all .
my view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions .
they 're poets , they 're philosophers , they 're photographers , they 're filmmakers .
and that has all sorts of advantages .
we recognize them in relation to corporations .
whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff — the therapists , the poets — are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
that 's something we can learn from .
i want to conclude .
if you 're involved in anything that 's communal , that involves lots of people getting together , there are things for you in religion .
if you 're involved , say , in a travel industry in any way , look at pilgrimage .
we have n't begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we have n't looked at what religions do with travel .
you can get shot by the hard-headed atheists , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
ca : but you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from , which is this sense — that 's actually probably the most important thing to anyone who 's religious — of spiritual experience , of some kind of connection with something that 's bigger than you are .
the universe is large and we are tiny , without the need for further religious superstructure .
ca : it seems to me that there 's plenty of people in the ted community who are atheists .
but probably most people in the community certainly do n't think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common .
are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where , instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war , that there could be bridging ?
politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
`` but we need to get to a stage when you 're an atheist and someone says , `` '' well you know , i did pray the other day , '' '' you politely ignore it . ''
and i think that 's what the religious wars of late have ignored .
( laughter ) ab : well , one thing that we 're all very suspicious of is individual leaders .
what i 've tried to lay out is a framework and i 'm hoping that people can just fill it in .
i 've sketched a sort of broad framework .
but wherever you are , as i say , if you 're in the travel industry , do that travel bit .
we got to the moon for one simple reason : john kennedy committed us to a deadline .
`` and they are what give the word `` '' moonshot '' '' its meaning . ''
and our world is in desperate need of political leaders willing to set bold deadlines for the achievement of daring dreams on the scale of apollo again .
of the 30 astronauts in the original mercury , gemini and apollo programs , only seven marriages survived .
`` thomas merton also wrote about wars among saints and that `` '' there is a pervasive form of contemporary violence to which the idealist most easily succumbs : activism and overwork . ''
a circle , a ring . it 's called an einstein ring . einstein predicted that , ok .
so this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye .
so the expansion slows down with time .
so a little over a decade ago , two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down , ok .
the startling answer to this question , ok , from these experiments , was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , ok .
no one was predicting ahead of time this is what 's going to be found .
it was the opposite of what was expected .
but we do n't have a good motivation for putting it in there at this point , ok .
so clusters of galaxies will tend to form , because of all this gravitational attraction .
i mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon , ok , things that i have n't even talked about , that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting , new particle .
but we do n't know if either of those are actually the dark matter candidate , ok .
it is possible that dark matter particles might be produced at the large hadron collider .
and i 'm sure you have lots of questions , which i very much look forward to addressing over the next 72 hours , while i 'm here . thank you .
i 'm a very lucky person .
and it made me want to explore more .
you might think that it 's quite hard to find new stories and new subjects , but new technology is changing the way we can film .
images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar .
lots of snow in which to dig a den .
but getting down can be a challenge for small cubs .
and it 's a wonderful bit of gear , because it 's like having a flying tripod , crane and dolly all rolled into one .
the first year we got nothing .
the cloud lifted , the wind was still , and even the bear showed up .
now , when i heard about one animal , i knew we had to get it for my next series , untamed americas , for national geographic .
( music ) this two-and-a-half-inch bat has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue , the longest relative to body length of any mammal in the world .
we filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times .
so imagine how quick that thing is in real life .
`` now people often ask me , `` '' where 's your favorite place on the planet ? '' '' and the truth is i just do n't have one . ''
but some locations draw you back time and time again .
i snowboarded after school , and i slept a lot .
it turns out i did n't end up being part of the play , but through it i met thordis .
thordis elva : i was 16 and in love for the first time .
tom was n't an armed lunatic ; he was my boyfriend .
but i did n't show up at thordis 's door .
it was n't so much a conscious refusal , it was more like any acknowledgment of reality was forbidden .
i disavowed the truth by convincing myself it was sex and not rape .
deep down , i knew i 'd done something immeasurably wrong .
whether it be via distraction , substance use , thrill-seeking or the scrupulous policing of my inner speak , i refused to be static and silent .
i gripped tight to the simple notion that i was n't a bad person .
i did n't think i had this in my bones .
but that day , i watched in wonder as the words streamed out of my pen , forming the most pivotal letter i 've ever written , addressed to tom .
my era of shame was over .
before sending the letter , i prepared myself for all kinds of negative responses , or what i found likeliest : no response whatsoever .
as it turns out , he , too , had been imprisoned by silence .
i relieved myself of the burdens that i 'd wrongfully shouldered , and he , in turn , wholeheartedly owned up to what he 'd done .
ts : iceland and australia are geographically like this .
nowhere else has healing and rapprochement been tested like it has in south africa .
i read somewhere that you should try and be the person that you needed when you were younger .
how can we discuss solutions to one of the biggest threats to the lives of women and children around the world , if the very words we use are part of the problem ?
i felt deserving of thordis 's body .
these influences i speak of are external to me , though .
and it was only me in that room making choices , nobody else .
do n't underestimate the power of words .
saying to thordis that i raped her changed my accord with myself , as well as with her .
te : what we did is not a formula that we 're prescribing for others .
nobody has the right to tell anyone else how to handle their deepest pain or their greatest error .
the story we 've just relayed is unique , and yet it is so common with sexual violence being a global pandemic .
and i 'm talking about the very end .
technology can change our understanding of nature .
( applause ) ( applause ) i am a papercutter .
i moved for two years in taiwan .
and then i settled in new york where i became a tour guide .
and i still worked as a tour leader , traveled back and forth in china , tibet and central asia .
( applause ) i chose papercutting because paper is cheap , it 's light , and you can use it in a lot of different ways .
`` and he slashed so many budgets that people said they could n't afford paintings anymore , and they needed to have their portrait `` a la silhouette . '' ''
but to me , they are fascinating objects to visually narrate a story .
i love pun and the relation to the unconscious .
so i 'm always looking for the false cognates or identical words in different languages .
and my daily language is english .
so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english .
so i want to see how things work and what 's happening .
and i revisit this world thinking about the image or cliché about what we want to do , and what are the words , colloquialisms , that we have with the expressions .
so what if we were living in balloon houses ?
and my inspirations are very eclectic .
i 'm influenced by everything i read , everything i see .
i call them freudian cities .
`` `` electricity . '' ''
`` `` chaos city . '' ''
one story leads to another .
i started with small images , i started with a few miles .
then i went to run 50k , then 60k .
some people are born in hells , and against all odds , they make it to heavens .
other people make the opposite trip .
that 's the border .
you have sweatshops in hells .
`` so the whole `` '' hells and heavens '' '' is about free will and determinism . ''
it 's one i 'm wearing and one that 's on exhibition at the center for books arts in new york city .
why do i call it a book ?
`` here it 's in scottsdale , arizona , and it 's called `` '' floating memories . '' '' so it 's regional memories , and they are just randomly moved by the wind . ''
i love public art .
after eight years of rejection , i was thrilled to get my first commission with the percent for art in new york city .
here it 's faceted glass in the bronx .
and bronx literature , it 's all about bronx writers and their stories .
so i made a vegetable point of view of the growth of san jose .
and then the fruit of the world for silicon valley today .
i took library material that had fruit in their title and i used them to make an orchard walk with these fruits of knowledge .
and it 's all about international writing systems .
and on the branches you have library material growing .
`` and it 's called `` '' seeds of the future are planted today . '' '' it 's a story about transformation and connections . ''
so it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter , and not to have objects falling on the rails .
so each building has its own personality .
`` i created `` '' all around town . '' '' it is a papercutting , and then after , i added color on the computer . ''
and in all these universes , it 's like imagination is the vehicle to be transported with , but the destination is our minds and how we can reconnect with the essential and with the magic .
my grandfather was a giant , too .
grandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods , and how my family was knit into it .
so grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog .
so i went back to school , and i studied my other world .
and then i borrowed some high-tech stuff from my university : a geiger counter , a scintillation counter , a mass spectrometer , microscopes .
( laughter ) and they all operate at the same time .
what are we supposed to do ?
because , again , i think that when i am aware of them , more of them happen .
use the internet . go on the internet .
well , you can imagine that i thought that without that , there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of copenhagen .
and it was n't just the usual suspects .
we 're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all or living life as the sum of all of us .
i 'm a textile artist most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement .
so i wrapped the door handle .
the reaction was wild .
( applause )
it 's kind of a magic place , the mountain .
it will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye .
we can now trace back to 14 billion years .
but now , there are almost 2,000 other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect , measure masses for .
and so , if you think about the precision of these mirrors , the bumps on the mirror , over the entire 27 feet , amount to less than one-millionth of an inch .
it 's tens of millions of light-years away .
so , keep your eyes on those bright images again .
thank you very much .
stay with me , because i have a question for you .
these are movies . they 're fiction .
and by and large , that turns out to be the case .
which means that , while we all have one biography , they have many .
it 's about the size of a rugby ball .
it 's made of clay , and it 's been fashioned into a cylinder shape , covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun .
but today , this thing is , i believe , a major player in the politics of the middle east .
and you all know roughly the story .
this is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we 've got .
and it 's written , as we 'll see in due course , by very skilled p.r . consultants .
so the hyperbole is not actually surprising .
he 'll let them return to their countries .
all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home , and they 'll take with them their gods .
it 's a central document in jewish history .
and the book of chronicles , the book of ezra in the hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms .
`` `` '' thus said cyrus , king of persia , 'all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven given thee , and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem . ''
the empire of iran , the medes and the persians , united under cyrus , became the first great world empire .
it was the largest empire the world had known until then .
the fact that this decree is in babylonian says one thing .
and the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen , and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by alexander .
and of course , alexander could n't sustain a government and it fragmented .
and xenophon 's book on cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the founding fathers of the american revolution .
meanwhile , back in babylon , things had not been going well .
after alexander , the other empires , babylon declines , falls into ruins , and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost — until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a british museum exhibition digging in babylon .
and it enters now another story .
no other evidence .
suddenly , this appeared .
it 's a great 19th century moment .
marduk takes cyrus by the hand , calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of babylon .
and it 's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah , and yet , jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk .
40 years on and we 're in 1917 , and the cylinder enters a different world .
and across eastern europe , jews display pictures of cyrus and of george v side by side — the two great rulers who have allowed the return to jerusalem .
the state of israel is setup , and 50 years later , in the late 60s , it 's clear that britain 's role as the imperial power is over .
and another story of the cylinder begins .
the region , the u.k. and the u.s. decide , has to be kept safe from communism , and the superpower that will be created to do this would be iran , the shah .
and so the shah invents an iranian history , or a return to iranian history , that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the cyrus cylinder .
when he has his great celebrations in persepolis , he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the british museum , goes to tehran , and is part of those great celebrations of the pahlavi dynasty .
cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the shah .
islamic revolution , no more cyrus ; we 're not interested in that history , we 're interested in islamic iran — until iraq , the new superpower that we 've all decided should be in the region , attacks .
and it becomes critical for the iranians to remember their great past , their great past when they fought iraq and won .
they want to borrow the cyrus cylinder .
this is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the west .
and in the current iran , zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed places in the iranian parliament , something to be very , very proud of .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of jews living in iran came to tehran to see it .
will iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated ?
in the world of the middle east at the moment , the debates are , as you know , shrill .
but i think it 's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing , the cyrus cylinder .
( applause )
imagine that you 're a pig farmer .
but then they would have to drive back into the city to test those samples in their central lab .
two weeks later , you 'd hear back the results .
two weeks may be just enough time for infection to spread and take away your way of life .
but it does n't have to be that way .
the genetic instructions encoded in dna inform how our bodies develop , grow , function .
your genetic information is strung into a long and twisted molecule , the dna double helix , that has over three billion letters , beginning to end .
but the lines that carry meaningful information are usually very short — a few dozen to several thousand letters long .
am i of irish descent ?
the inventor of this dna-copying technique was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1993 .
we were curious , as curious as you would have been if i had shown you this picture in 1980 .
`` ( laughter ) you would have thought , `` '' wow ! ''
and the same is true for personal dna technology today .
and it 's a rare fungus .
but even to a trained eye like paul 's , even when looked at under a microscope , these truffles can pass for authentic .
i bet you will never look at that black truffle risotto again without thinking of its genes .
when the ebola outbreak broke out in western africa , he quickly realized that doctors there lacked the basic tools to detect and combat disease .
but here 's a surprise : the same equipment that ian could use at his lab in the uk to sequence and diagnose ebola , just would n't work under these conditions .
but instead , ian could use personal dna machines small enough to be placed in front of the air-conditioning unit to keep sequencing the virus and keep saving lives .
this may seem like an extreme place for dna analysis , but let 's move on to an even more extreme environment : outer space .
a 16-year-old designing a dna experiment to protect the lives of astronauts may seem like a rarity , the mark of a child genius .
this is not a family made of phd scientists .
this is a family like any other .
it is in our dna to be curious .
it 's still thermally hot but it 's not radioactive .
you can put them anywhere in the world you want to .
and here you have the dataset .
it 's not really , really flat .
they vaccinated the kids . they get better water .
i landed for the first time in rome , italy .
( laughter ) that 's right .
this is not quite how it panned out .
i was crushed .
it 's a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world .
it 's exciting . it 's inspiring .
it turned out to be incredibly successful .
the unit that i worked with in rome , they were unique .
they brought in the academic world .
and if we really want to make big changes in big problems like world hunger , we need everybody to the table .
i 've seen what companies can do , and i 've seen what companies are n't doing , and i think there 's three main ways that we can fill that gap : by donating data , by donating decision scientists and by donating technology to gather new sources of data .
bonus , it also makes good business sense .
some companies are already doing it .
you need to respect privacy concerns , for example by anonymizing the data .
most of them work for companies .
if a company was going to donate a block of a decision scientist 's time , it would actually make more sense to spread out that block of time over a long period , say for example five years .
but the types of results that can be produced are undeniable .
it 's a win all around .
`` you 've probably heard of the saying `` '' food for thought . '' '' well , this is literally thought for food . ''
they 're far more efficient in terms of energy .
so there 's something super interesting about natural systems .
and i think the key to that is self-assembly .
the other one is from the previous brick that was placed .
and then it gives you an output in 3d space .
if you have errors , you can replace a part .
so you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one .
each element is completely identical , and they 're biased .
so when you shake the chain , it then folds up into any configuration that you 've programmed in — so in this case , a spiral , or in this case , two cubes next to each other .
i think that it 's telling us that there 's new possibilities for self-assembly , replication , repair in our physical structures , our buildings , machines .
that 's amazing parallel and distributed computing power , new design possibilities .
you ca n't delay that much .
but while this picture is beautiful , it 's static , and the earth is constantly changing .
and that 's not the only trick we learned from silicon valley .
we 've used modern production techniques so we can build large numbers of them , i think for the first time .
our entire team is passionate about using satellites to help humanity .
and we have decided , therefore , that the best thing that we could do with our data is to ensure universal access to it .
what exploration would you do ?
my work as a woman photographer was considered a serious insult to local traditions , and created a lasting stigma for me and my family .
they made clear that a woman must not do a man 's job .
as a palestinian female photographer , the journey of struggle , survival and everyday life has inspired me to overcome the community taboo and see a different side of war and its aftermath .
we started running very low on food . we were both pretty hungry , losing lots of weight .
if they come to water , they 'll climb in , swim across it .
( video ) : oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh .
the plane taxied up to where i was standing .
this is probably why i did n't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip .
we 've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist — things from tractors , bread ovens , circuit makers .
i had no practical skills .
so i started a farm in missouri and learned about the economics of farming .
i paid to get it repaired — then it broke again .
and now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
a greater distribution of the means of production , environmentally sound supply chains , and a newly relevant diy maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity .
but anyway , take a look at its pollen .
i 'm the ceo of dosomething.org .
it 's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people .
it 's my dad .
`` we get things like , `` '' i want to die . ''
thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression — huge .
`` and we know that if you text in `` '' sex , '' '' `` '' oral '' '' and `` '' mormon , '' '' you 're questioning if you 're gay . ''
the worst time of day for substance abuse : 5am .

i had all kinds of rats , mice , hamsters , gerbils , squirrels .
i started working in the industry , but i was n't really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear , extracting and manufacturing mode .
as long as these devices are there , or there is suspicion of landmines , you ca n't really enter into the land .
why would you choose rats ?
well , actually rats are , in contrary to what most people think about them , rats are highly sociable creatures .
and actually , our product — what you see here .
there 's a target somewhere here .
it scratches on the soil .
here , the animal gets its food reward .
rats have been used since the '50s last century , in all kinds of experiments .
rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .
moreover , they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it .
now how do we communicate with rats ?
once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food — so click is food — we bring it in a cage with a hole , and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed , and to do that for five seconds — five seconds , which is long for a rat .
once the animal knows this , we make the task a bit more difficult .
in the next step , animals learn to find real mines in real minefields .
they are tested and accredited according to international mine action standards , just like dogs have to pass a test .
maybe one slight difference : we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog .
this is our team in mozambique : one tanzanian trainer , who transfers the skills to these three mozambican fellows .
if you can bring in more rats , we can actually make the output even bigger .
eleven african governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology .
they have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the great lakes region , and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines .
microscopy , the standard who procedure , reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability .
and if , however , you are detected very early , diagnosed early , treatment can start , and even in hiv-positives , it makes sense .
so in our common language , dutch , the name for t.b .
`` is `` '' tering , '' '' which , etymologically , refers to the smell of tar . ''
so how does it work ?
you put these 10 samples at once in the cage .
this is a positive sample .
and by doing so , very fast , we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive , which are negative .
throughout last year , we 've been — depending on which intervals you take — we 've been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
this is in a prototype stage .
( applause )
i can love a book , a movie .
i can love escalopes .
( laughter ) but there 's a great difference between an escalope and my wife , for instance .
hence the eternal problem of love : how to become and remain desirable ?
the individual used to find an answer to this problem by submitting his life to community rules .
this phenomenon is modernity .
now individuals are free to value or disvalue any attitude , any choice , any object .
hence the anxiety of contemporary man .
well , by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability .
nothing could be less materialistic , or more sentimental , than a teenager buying brand new jeans and tearing them at the knees , because he wants to please jennifer .
it is rather what is swallowed up and sacrificed in the name of the god of love , or rather in the name of seduction capital .
in light of this observation on contemporary love , how can we think of love in the years to come ?
`` `` '' pick-up '' '' is to pick someone up , but not just any picking up — it 's picking up chicks . ''
i 'm thinking particularly of the reaction of neo-fascist or religious communes .
how to renounce the hysterical need to be valued ?
in contrast to this attitude , i call upon tenderness — love as tenderness .
to be tender is to accept the loved one 's weaknesses .
and there 's a lot of them that i actually ca n't show you on this chart .
computers were used for artillery first , then irs .
that 's — you do n't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record .
it 's not a thing i often do , so listen carefully .
they 're little . they 're five years old .
now we 're talking scale .
and then in the 20th century a lot of things changed .
one of the things that surprised me most in my research , though , is how changeable attitudes actually are .
another of our exhibits was a series of postcards that people could take away with them .
everything is interconnected .
they can grow so big , blocking all daylight , making it very dark and ominous standing under them .
and then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming , the greens and the turquoise blues .
my hair used to be straight .
( laughter ) i 'm just kidding . ( laughter )
as i stand under them , i see not just a cloud , but understand that what i have the privilege to witness is the same forces , the same process in a small-scale version that helped to create our galaxy , our solar system , our sun and even this very planet .
all my relations . thank you .
1995 , we found three . the count now is up to 80 — we 're finding about two or three a month .
we have lost 25 percent of the unique species in hawaii in the last 20 years .
it 's that simple . this is an amazingly unregulated field .
we need to learn how to repair and replenish the earth 's ozone layer .
one percent does n't sound like a lot , but it would cause one hell of an ice age here .
we think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the milky way alone , our galaxy .
astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years .
this is a chart that dr. clark chapman at the southwest research institute presented to congress a few years ago .
( laughter ) they also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is .
this is a poem about mark antony .
fast forwarding a decade later to 2012 , i was entering my third low-performing school as principal .
i always believed that what happens in a school and what does not happen in a school is up to the principal .
i am the principal , and having that title required me to lead .
i am a leader , so i know i can not do anything alone .
we decorated every bulletin board in that building with bright , colorful , and positive messages .
all during the school day .
the results ?
i grew up poor in north philadelphia too .
`` and they respond by saying , `` because we like feeling special . '' ''
so this is a rather fraught situation .
the first is the one we hear a lot about : college .
in the first 18 months that i lived in this neighborhood , i wrote down every time i saw any contact between police and people that were my neighbors .
fifty-two times , i watched the police break down doors , chase people through houses or make an arrest of someone in their home .
bit by bit , i got to know two brothers , chuck and tim .
chuck was 18 when we met , a senior in high school .
the family was really struggling .
that winter , a kid in the schoolyard called chuck 's mom a crack whore .
okay , you might say .
not a single kid that i went to college with has a criminal record right now .
the question for us now is , how much can we make of it ?
how much can we change ?
he was a man of tremendous leadership .
how do we solve it ?
but on the other hand , something is wrong .
the problem is not technology .
i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
i did n't make good grades in high school .
how do you make a mountain bike for your arms that does n't have the mountain bike cost and complexity ?
it 's the person that 's sliding his hands up and down the levers , so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world .
the first is that this product works well because we were effectively able to combine rigorous engineering science and analysis with user-centered design focused on the social and usage and economic factors important to wheelchair users in the developing countries .
and the final point i want to make is that i think this project worked well because we engaged all the stakeholders that buy into this project and are important to consider in bringing the technology from inception of an idea through innovation , validation , commercialization and dissemination , and that cycle has to start and end with end users .
but the day after he got an lfc , he hopped in it , rode that kilometer , opened up his shop and soon after landed a contract to make school uniforms and started making money , started providing for his family again .
the next day i went to my shop .
`` i said , `` '' you make your own groups of four . ''
i 'll come back after two months .
we could change everything .
in 2013 , if you 're concerned about a depression diagnosis , you go to your doctor , and what do you get ?
seymour recruited me to caltech in the late 1980s .
now , in humans we often infer emotional states , as you 'll hear later today , from facial expressions .
i come from costa rica , a developing country .
and i 'm grateful .
and you might be thinking that it was good luck , but it was n't .
in the '70s we invested in national parks , and that kept us away from the deeply flawed logic of growth , growth , growth at any cost that you see others embracing , especially in the developing world .
that 's not the point .
also , if you take a country like ours , the gdp per capita is around 11,000 dollars , depending on how you measure it .
because why would we continue importing oil for transportation if we can use electricity instead ?
i do n't understand why we have to accept this as normal .
and these really cool creatures are saving money , and they reduce pollution .
but of course , some get very uncomfortable with this idea , and they will come and they will tell you that the world is stuck with oil , and so is costa rica , so get real .
that 's what they tell you .
first , our model of transportation and urbanization is broken , so this is the best moment to redefine our urban and mobility future .
because if we continue adding fleets of conventional cars , our cities will become unbearable .
the news went viral around the world .
`` `` limpia '' means `` clean , '' because we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens . ''
we should not let anybody take that away from us .
and you know what ?
so what we do is concrete things , and we translate technical issues into citizen language to show that citizens have a role to play and can play it together .
it 's bright and peaceful , and when you stand up in front of it , it 's really hard to believe these were military barracks at the end of the '40s .
i worked on development and agriculture issues in the u.n. system .
it 's not inevitable , but we need to act decisively .
so just 12 cities . she was born in manchester , england , the ninth largest city in the world .
other companies have sustainability strategies .
but first , let 's think of customers .
then they care about big issues like climate change .
so take your mind back and think of the first sustainable products .
and we had the rough , recycled toilet paper .
we can make products that are beautiful or ugly , sustainable or unsustainable , affordable or expensive , functional or useless .
and the best thing is , they 'll also last for more than 20 years .
you 'll change your smartphone seven or eight times , probably more if you 're in this audience .
what we decided to do was not to sell leds on the side marked up high and continue to push all the old bulbs , the halogens and the cfls .
( applause ) it 's not just about products in people 's homes .
obviously there 's fantastic opportunities with recycled materials , and we can and will go zero waste .
but we 're still dependent on natural , raw materials .
it 's a brilliant textile in use .
yields increase , and you halve the input costs .
take the topic of 100 percent targets , actually .
it 's a simple choice , so we 've worked for many years with the forest stewardship council , with literally hundreds of other organizations , and there 's a point here about collaboration .
now together , through our supply chain , with partners , we 've managed to certify 35 million hectares of forestry .
so be decisive on these issues .
we know we 'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years ' time .
and why not take control of it ourselves ?
you 've got to say that 's not enough today .
so we 've launched a women 's open network this week in ikea , and we 'll do whatever it takes to lead the change .
it 's still nice to do , but it 's a must-do .
be a discerning consumer .
vote with your wallets .
search out the companies that are acting on this .
on having really good sustainability strategies , there are companies like nike , patagonia , timberland , marks & spencer .
but i do n't think any of those businesses would say they 're perfect . we certainly would n't .
( applause )
so i 'm just going to go into a different step now , which is easier for me .
my country is war-torn .
i know it 's a shame . but who is to be blamed ?
so now i 'm doing music so i know what the power of music is .
over one billion people use birth control without any hesitation at all .
some people think when we talk about contraception that it 's code for abortion , which it 's not .
here in germany , the proportion of people that use contraception is about 66 percent .
in el salvador , very similar , 66 percent .
thailand , 64 percent .
nigeria , the most populous country in africa , 10 percent .
this is the same story across the continent of africa today .
so if we 're going to make progress on this issue , we have to be really clear about what our agenda is .
what i 'm talking about is giving women the power to save their lives , to save their children 's lives and to give their families the best possible future .
and i think as long as we 're really clear about what our agenda is , there 's a global movement waiting to happen and ready to get behind this totally uncontroversial idea .
now , as a mother , what do i want the very most for my children ?
but what 's not universal is our ability to provide every good thing .
so many women suffer from domestic violence .
and over the next 150 years , this trend spread all across europe .
i think , as we go through this history , it 's important to pause for a moment and to remember why this has become such a contentious issue .
for instance , in the 1960s , india adopted very specific numeric targets and they paid women to accept having an iud placed in their bodies .
now , indian women were really smart in this situation .
and so what did they do ?
for decades in the united states , african-american women were sterilized without their consent .
given the option , they will have fewer children .
the question is : will we invest in helping all women get what they want now ?
twenty years later , following those villages , what we learned is that they had a better quality of life than their neighbors .
the families were healthier .
what you 're proposing is going to increase the likelihood that lots of sex happens outside marriage .
we 've listed the website up here . join the conversation .
and , you know , the nuns who taught me were incredibly progressive .
whether this is a personal decision — whether you 're going to install a burglar alarm in your home — or a national decision — where you 're going to invade some foreign country — you 're going to trade off something , either money or time , convenience , capabilities , maybe fundamental liberties .
and the question to ask when you look at a security anything is not whether this makes us safer , but whether it 's worth the trade-off .
you 've heard in the past several years , the world is safer because saddam hussein is not in power .
in politics also , there are different opinions .
we make these trade-offs again and again , multiple times a day .
they 're just part of being alive ; we all do it .
and if you think about it , the rabbits that are good at making that trade-off will tend to live and reproduce , and the rabbits that are bad at it will get eaten or starve .
so you 'd think that us , as a successful species on the planet — you , me , everybody — would be really good at making these trade-offs .
one way to think of it is that we 're highly optimized for risk decisions that are endemic to living in small family groups in the east african highlands in 100,000 b.c .
the unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar .
this is for children .
if you hear a lot about tiger attacks , there must be a lot of tigers around .
this works until you invent newspapers .
i tell people , if it 's in the news , do n't worry about it .
( laughter ) when something is so common , it 's no longer news — car crashes , domestic violence — those are the risks you worry about .
`` i mean , the joke `` '' one , two , three , many '' '' is kind of right . ''
one mango , two mangoes , three mangoes , 10,000 mangoes , 100,000 mangoes — it 's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot .
one in a million , one in a billion — they 're both almost never .
or the other way , and that 's a false sense of insecurity .
`` i write a lot about `` '' security theater , '' '' which are products that make people feel secure , but do n't actually do anything . ''
so what makes people notice ?
but if you know stuff , you 're more likely to have your feelings match reality .
security theater 's exposed when it 's obvious that it 's not working properly .
there are n't enough examples of failures .
i have feeling and reality .
it does n't change ; it 's real .
you do n't need a model .
there 's no feeling about germs .
the tracker i was with grew up in kruger national park .
i could have taken him to new york , and he would have died in a day .
models can come from the media , from our elected officials .
so models can change .
models eventually fade into the background .
so there was that feeling of lack of control .
as the novelty wore off , the months went by , there was some amount of tolerance , people got used to it .
by autumn , people thought the doctors should have solved this already .
i 'm going to give one more complication .
i have a very relativistic view of security .
and stakeholders with specific trade-offs will try to influence the decision .
and i call that their agenda .
this is not uncommon .
compare that to the secondhand smoke debate — probably about 20 years behind .
think about seat belts .
if they equal your feelings , you do n't even know you have a model .
it has to get very compelling before we 'll pay attention .
new models that extend long periods of time are hard .
we can do to the next harvest .
but 80 years , we 're just not good at .
eventually , the new model will replace the old model .
also , personal experiences with crime can do it , personal health scare , a health scare in the news .
so in the technological world , we do n't have experience to judge models .
i flew here yesterday .
i did n't check the airplane .
it 's a model we just accept pretty much by faith .
now , what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models — have it reflected in their feelings — to allow them to make security trade-offs .
the smoking debate took 40 years , and that was an easy one .
remember i said feeling , model , reality ; i said reality does n't change . it actually does .
so we might have — for the first time in our species — feeling chases model , model chases reality , reality 's moving — they might never catch up .
it 's a horrific story . someone took a bottle of tylenol , put poison in it , closed it up , put it back on the shelf .
i 'll give you one , a syringe .
but if you think about it , if you are a hospital , and you need to take a baby away from its mother , out of the room to run some tests , you better have some good security theater , or she 's going to rip your arm off .
it 's important that , if our feelings match reality , we make better security trade-offs .
i 'm not sure that every person here is familiar with my pictures .
i was born in 1944 in brazil , in the times that brazil was not yet a market economy .
when i was 15 years old , it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger — much bigger — where i did the second part of secondary school .
i [ did ] a master 's degree in economics .
but during the time that i was photographing this , i lived through a very hard moment in my life , mostly in rwanda .
i saw deaths by thousands per day .
i went to see a friend 's doctor in paris , told him that i was completely sick .
`` he made a long examination , and told me , `` '' sebastian , you are not sick , your prostate is perfect . ''
`` you must stop because on the contrary , you will be dead . '' '' and i made the decision to stop . ''
it was the moment that my parents became very old .
to build our development , we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything .
this farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds , and we did n't know how to deal with these .
we started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees , only local species , only native species , where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed , and the life started to come back in an incredible way .
we created an institution called instituto terra , and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere .
and i wanted to see us when we used , yes , our instruments in stone .
we must protect the forest in this sense .
well , this — ( applause ) — thank you . thank you very much .
this is what we must fight hard to hold like it is now .
the only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing , always , even if we reduce them , everything that we do , we produce co2 , are the trees .
me , one minute , it 's dry . the same with the trees .
all the branches of the trees , the leaves that come down create a humid area , and they take months and months under the water , go to the rivers , and maintain our source , maintain our rivers .
we are doing the sequestration of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees .
my friends , it 's very easy to do . we did it , no ?
this is a much more powerful and much , much more effective weapon .
this instrument was the first of its kind .
in the 1700s , music-making machines became the playthings of the parisian elite .
if you could program a machine to make pleasing sounds , why not program it to weave delightful patterns of color out of cloth ?
this was the first programmable loom .
the playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory , seeking out new possibilities in the world around us .
and that seeking is why so many experiences that started with simple delight and amusement eventually led us to profound breakthroughs .
video : whoa ! ( laughter ) al gore : she 's okay . the question is whether we will be .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new lakes , which a few years ago were glaciers .
the flows have increased .
this drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours — 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
but we 're beginning to see a sea change .
and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal , which is an oxymoron .
you probably saw it on the news .
one of the coal industry 's ads around christmas was this one .
he 's affordable and adorable , and workers keep their pay .
that 's why we 've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal .
amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
video : narrator : america is in crisis — the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the thread that links them all : our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess .
video : narrator : it 's about repowering america .
man : future 's over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
`` if you want to go far , go together . '' '' we need to go far , quickly . ''
rs : that one is joshua 's . that 's right .
and she puts it in her friend 's coffee .
it started early .
indeed , when ireland first joined the european union in 1973 , there were parts of the country that were considered developing , including my own beloved native county , county mayo .
as i listened to president tong describing the situation , i really felt that this was a problem that no leader should have to face .
i came to climate change not as a scientist or an environmental lawyer , and i was n't really impressed by the images of polar bears or melting glaciers .
`` and i kept hearing this pervasive sentence : `` oh , but things are so much worse now , things are so much worse . '' ''
i met constance okollet , who had formed a women 's group in eastern uganda , and she told me that when she was growing up , she had a very normal life in her village and they did n't go hungry , they knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come , they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest , and so they had enough food .
but , in recent years , at the time of this conversation , they had nothing but long periods of drought , and then flash flooding , and then more drought .
she forms this women 's group to try to keep her community together .
and the average person in malawi emits about 80 kg of co2 a year .
the average us citizen emits about 17.5 metric tons .
i think it was really the importance of the injustice that really struck me very forcibly .
governments around the world agreed at the conference in copenhagen , and have repeated it at every conference on climate , that we have to stay below two degrees celsius of warming above pre-industrial standards .
and that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century .
2.6 billion people cook on open fires — on coal , wood and animal dung .
this , of course , is beyond the resources of kiribati itself .
but would n't it be wonderful to have this engineering wonder and to allow a people to remain in their sovereign territory , and be part of the community of nations ?
that is the kind of idea that we should be thinking about .
yes , the challenges of the transformation we need are big , but they can be solved .
the reality is that this issue is much too important to be left to politicians and to the united nations .
`` we really appreciate that they took the decisions that made a difference , and that put the world on the right pathway , and we benefit now from that pathway , '' '' that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities , we did what was done in 1945 in similar terms , we did n't miss the opportunity , we lived up to our responsibilities . ''
and so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health .
and haiti , if you 've ever been there , is just a tragedy .
and bees are very faithful .
and i think that there is an easy cure for ndd .
i want to talk to you today about prosperity , about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity .
and recession , of course , is n't exactly a recipe for hope either , as we 're busy finding out .
it 's a dilemma , a dilemma of growth .
we ca n't live with it ; we ca n't live without it .
trash the system or crash the planet — it 's a tough choice ; it is n't much of a choice .
but i think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here .
and here in my chart — on the left-hand side is where we are now .
it 's around about 770 grams of carbon .
firms produce goods for households — that 's us — and provide us with incomes , and that 's even better , because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services .
i just want to highlight one key feature of this system , which is the role of investment .
but i want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty , the production and consumption of novelty .
it 's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty , continually chasing expanding consumer markets , consumer goods , new consumer goods .
we love new stuff — new material stuff for sure — but also new ideas , new adventures , new experiences .
but the materiality matters too , because in every society that anthropologists have looked at , material stuff operates as a kind of language — a language of goods , a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories — stories , for example , about how important we are .
and here , all of a sudden , we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic — the economic institutions , and who we are as people , locked together to drive an engine of growth .
and this engine is not just economic value ; it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system , driven by our own insatiable appetites , driven in fact by a sense of anxiety .
adam smith , 200 years ago , spoke about our desire for a life without shame .
a life without shame : in his day , what that meant was a linen shirt , and today , well , you still need the shirt , but you need the hybrid car , the hdtv , two holidays a year in the sun , the netbook and ipad , the list goes on — an almost inexhaustible supply of goods , driven by this anxiety .
and to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades , we 've expanded the money supply , expanded credit and debt , so that people can keep buying stuff .
this was the last 15 years before the crash , and you can see there , consumer debt rose dramatically .
and in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted .
is this really how people are ?
they want to hunker down , they want to look to the future .
`` keynes called this the `` '' paradox of thrift '' '' — saving slows down recovery . ''
and politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt , to draw down our own savings even further , just so that we can get the show back on the road , so we can keep this growth-based economy going .
it 's an anomaly , it 's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people .
these things save carbon , they save energy , they save us money .
and my , then , five year-old daughter was helping me in the way that five year-olds do .
these ones , interestingly , are 400 miles north of here outside barrow-in-furness in cumbria .
goodness knows what they make of the lake district weather .
`` `` '' it is , '' '' she said , `` '' to help create the social world and find a credible place in it . '' '' that is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives , and it 's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model . ''
novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself .
we 've created systems , which systematically privilege , encourage , one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded .
it is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human , recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect rembrandt 's fragile altruist within .
what does all this mean for economics ?
there you go , oxford , that 's where we are . see what comes up .
we 're just going to click on naturejobs.uk .
only now , investment is n't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth .
investment has to be , in the new economy , protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends .
it has to be about transition .
but it 's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this .
so this is not just a western post-materialist fantasy .
`` in fact , an african philosopher wrote to me , when `` '' prosperity without growth '' '' was published , pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional african concept of ubuntu . ''
its roots are long and deep — its foundations , i 've tried to show , exist already , inside each of us .
and at the heart of that economics , we 're placing a more credible , more robust , and more realistic vision of what it means to be human .
thank you very much .
( applause ) chris anderson : while they 're taking the podium away , just a quick question .
( laughter ) can you picture the politicians ever buying into this ?
you 're making news out of the things that tell you that we 're flourishing .
when we first started this kind of work , politicians would stand up , treasury spokesmen would stand up , and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves .
this is a kind of agenda , which actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma , because they 're hooked on the growth model themselves .
( applause )
i paint as well .
it 's called kunene region .
it killed almost everything that was left .
it does n't matter whether you 're a basketball player , a tennis player , a gymnast or a bridge player .
we all need people who will give us feedback .
i 'm talking about teachers .
`` if all my bridge coach ever told me was that i was `` '' satisfactory , '' '' i would have no hope of ever getting better . ''
our teachers deserve better .
it 's not fair to students , and it 's putting america 's global leadership at risk .
let 's start by asking who 's doing well .
well , unfortunately there 's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems .
we 're not even in the top 10 .
eleven out of 14 .
the u.s. is tied for 15th in reading , but we 're 23rd in science and 31st in math .
they made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work .
they even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues .
we had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices .
for example , did they ask their students challenging questions ?
i want to show you what this video component of met looks like in action .
( music ) ( video ) sarah brown wessling : good morning everybody .
to get started , we 're doing a peer review day , okay ?
you ca n't really dispute what you see on the video , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this .
and i 'm able to learn a lot from it .
i really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management , and just all of those different facets of the classroom .
i think that video exposes so much of what 's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand , and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about .
we also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis .
if you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions , you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions .
building this system will also require a considerable investment .
it would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education , find a career that 's fulfilling and rewarding , and have a chance to live out their dreams .
i 'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve .
( applause )
it 's an open-source project .
this doubles also as an ipod speaker .
it 's just , it 's difficult to describe this .
yup , yup , i think i probably am .
so it should look like this . you should be looking at something like this .
hopefully everybody ? more than 10 ?
so they get used to quite quickly to understanding the rules for social interactions , and are actually quite quick to point out when they’re broken .
and it’s this code negotiation that leads to productive play .
it does n't matter how big or small they are .
most of the world we live in today was forest .
nature , on the other hand , works in a totally opposite way .
the natural system produces by bringing elements together , atom by atom .
this is something which i learned when i made a forest in the backyard of my own house .
to make a forest we start with soil .
we survey the sacred groves , or sacred forests around old temples .
it could be a flowering forest , a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees , or it could simply be a native , wild evergreen forest .
we collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them .
this is an ambucycle .
we were passing by a bus stop .
we saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes .
the traffic is so bad . the distance , and everything .
when we got there , 20 minutes later , we started cpr on the kid .
that second he declared this child dead .
he could have saved this child .
i said to myself , there must be a better way .
`` and he said to me — i remember this like yesterday — he was a great guy , but he said to me , `` '' kid , go to school , or go open a falafel stand . ''
`` we 're not interested in your help . '' '' and he threw me out of the room . ''
as you see now , i 'm walking around like crazy , meshugenah .
i ran there by foot . i had no medical equipment .
when i got there , the 70-year-old man was lying on the floor , blood was gushing out of his neck .
`` ( applause ) `` '' hatzalah '' '' means `` '' rescue , '' '' for all of you who do n't know hebrew . ''
we 're not there to replace ambulances .
they ask me to meet . they wanted to meet with me .
we started hand in hand saving jews and arabs .
arabs were saving jews . jews were saving arabs .
they 're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives .
when i started this organization , i was 17 years old .
you even saw these volunteers in new york saving lives in the world trade center .
and we made a difference .
not an expert sexter .
here 's the idea .
this idea of affirmative consent comes from anti-rape activists who tell us that we need consent for every sexual act .
think about having surgery .
i still hear people asking me all the time , is n't a digital image somehow blurring the line between public and private because it 's digital , right ?
no ! no !
that does n't make any sense .
as princeton researcher janet vertesi argues , our data and our privacy , they 're not just personal , they 're actually interpersonal .
she shared nude photos of herself with her high school boyfriend , thinking she could trust him .
rising tensions culminated in the worst day of violence on february 20 , which became known as bloody thursday .
the reception of the hotel ukraine became a makeshift morgue .
there were lines of bodies laid in the street .
the following day , president yanukovych fled ukraine .
sadness enveloped maidan .
when i made these pictures , i believed that i was documenting the end of violent events in ukraine .
this is the nomadic dream , a different kind of american dream lived by young hobos , travelers , hitchhikers , vagrants and tramps .
by night , they sleep beneath the stars , huddled together with their packs of dogs , cats and pet rats between their bodies .
no one loses their inner demons by taking to the road .
the answer to such a question is as varied as the people that take to the road , but travelers often respond with a single word : freedom .
in a moment , i 'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this .
1847 , vienna , austria .
sanitation ? no .
how was that possible ?
so he ordered the doctors to sterilize their hands , and the deaths stopped .
it took 20 years for frenchman louis pasteur to prove that semmelweis was right .
he found that bacteria were the culprits .
let 's get started with dr. eric betzig .
he had no laboratory .
this revolutionary instrument got different protein molecules to light up in different colors , and with a computer , he was able to turn very , very fuzzy blurs into very sharp dots and produce images of unprecedented and startling clarity .
no .
he wanted movies .
but when we figure it out , we 'll have a better handle on life itself .
also , you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around ?
those are actin molecules .
that leads us to dr. aubrey de grey at cambridge .
for example , when we eat , we take in food and we metabolize it , and that throws off what we call free radicals .
so if you stop aging , all of you are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors .
i think he deserves a closer look .
he believes , and he 's made a convincing case , that using viruses we can do gene therapy , fix that dna and rejuvenate our cells .
now , this does n't mean that de grey is going to revolutionize our lifespans .
consider this : there are seven times more people alive today than during darwin 's time .
now , this does lead us to one odd thing .
you have seven shows in the top 10 at one time .
( laughter ) nl : my mother ...
that night newspapers were all over the house , my father was with his hat in front of his face , manacled to a detective .
and my mother was selling the furniture , because we were leaving — she did n't want to stay in that state of shame , in chelsea , massachusetts .
so ...
when my father was away , i was fooling with a crystal radio set that we had made together , and i caught a signal that turned out to be father coughlin .
tell us about him .
and he used to write presidents of the united states .
`` and i 'd pick up a little white envelope reading , `` '' shya c. called at this address . '' '' and that 's the story i have told about my grandfather — eh : they wrote him back on the envelopes — nl : they wrote back . ''
the truth was my grandfather took me to parades , we had lots of those .
the truth is he would write an occasional letter , and i did pick up those little envelopes .
and , i mean , i stole arthur marshall 's grandfather and made him my own .
always .
`` when i started to write my memoir — `` even this — '' how about that ? ''
so much so that i appropriated arthur marshall 's grandfather .
now i 've gone through a whole lot of shit and come out on the other side , and i forgive my father — the best thing i — the worst thing i — the word i 'd like to use about him and think about him is — he was a rascal .
the fact that he lied and stole and cheated and went to prison ...
`` i submerge that in the word `` '' rascal . '' '' eh : well there 's a saying that amateurs borrow and professionals steal . ''
( laughter ) and that quote is widely attributed to john lennon , but it turns out he stole it from t.s . eliot .
( laughter ) nl : well ...
you managed to push culture forward through your art while also achieving world-beating commercial success .
nl : here 's where my mind goes when i hear that recitation of all i accomplished .
anything i may have accomplished is — my sister once asked me what she does about something that was going on in newington , connecticut .
i am convinced we 're all responsible for doing as much as i may have accomplished .
ladies and gentlemen , the incomparable norman lear .
well , in the book , i argue that these are , in fact , non sequiturs .
but here , there — one of the most famous literary english scholars of our time is the berkeley professor , judith butler .
someone asked me whether i stuck it in in order to deflect ire from discussions of gender and nazism and race and so on . i wo n't comment on that .
until the studies are redone with adoptive children , who provide an environment but not genes to their kids , we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid .
you might think , well , then they 'd be even more similar , because not only would they share their genes , but they would also share their environment .
everything that happens to you in a given home over all of those years appears to leave no permanent stamp on your personality or intellect .
so let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices .
